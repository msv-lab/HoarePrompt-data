Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is the old `x` + 1, `n` is the old `x`, `x` is a new input integer, `l` is a new list of integers from the input, `flag` is `False`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `n` is the old `x`, `l` is a new list of integers from the input. If the element at index `l[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is `True`. Otherwise, `flag` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0, `n` is the old `x`, `l` is a new list of integers from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `flag` and the loop or if statement does not break.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `n` is the old `x`, `l` is a new list of integers from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `flag`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
