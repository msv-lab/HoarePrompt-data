The code snippet provided is:

```python
x = int(input())
```

This means that the value of `x` will be updated to whatever integer is provided as input. The initial state mentions that the loop completes all `x` iterations and prints `3`, `i` is `x`, and `n` is `x`. Since the value of `x` is being reassigned, the previous values of `i` and `n` (which were equal to the old value of `x`) are no longer valid in the context of the new `x` value.

Output State: **the loop completes all x iterations and prints 3, `i` is the old x, `n` is the old x, `x` is an input integer.**
