Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Alice's Move:** Alice should remove the `k` smallest elements from the array to maximize the remaining sum. The current implementation sorts the array in descending order and does not correctly remove the smallest elements.

2. **Bob's Move:** After Alice's move, Bob should flip the sign of the `x` smallest elements to minimize the sum. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the sum by subtracting the top `x` elements twice, which does not account for the optimal selection of elements to flip.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        if k >= n:
            print(0)
            continue
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips the x smallest elements
        a.sort()
        for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- Alice removes the `k` smallest elements by sorting the array and slicing off the first `k` elements.
- Bob flips the sign of the `x` smallest elements from the remaining array.
- The final sum is computed and printed.
