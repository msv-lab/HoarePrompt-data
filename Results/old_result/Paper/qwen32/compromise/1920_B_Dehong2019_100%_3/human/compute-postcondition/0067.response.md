The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. 

Given that `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is calculated as `x + k - 1`, and `ans1` is initially the sum of all elements in `a`, the value of `ans1` will be reduced by twice the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` is the second integer read from the new input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - a[i] * 2`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the iterations, `_` is incremented by 1.**
