The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` modifies the value of `ans1` by adding the element at index `i` of the list `a` to it. 

Given the initial state, `ans1` is initially calculated as `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. After the code snippet is executed, `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]`, making its new value `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 2`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]`, `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`**
