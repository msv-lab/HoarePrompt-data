The given code snippet updates `ans2` by comparing it with `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `ans1` is only updated in the initial conditions provided, not in this snippet. The only change is in `ans2` which takes the maximum value between `ans1` and its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans1` remains as calculated in the previous iteration, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value.**
