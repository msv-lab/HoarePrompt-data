Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is the third integer read from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `2x + k - 2`, `ans2` is equal to `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`, `_` is incremented by `x`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2]) + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is not updated.**
