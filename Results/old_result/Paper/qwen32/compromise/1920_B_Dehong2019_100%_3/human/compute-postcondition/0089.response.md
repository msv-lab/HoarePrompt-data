Let's analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is `ans1 (initial state) - a[1 + x] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains `ans1 (initial state) + a[1]`.
- `ans2` is updated to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

Now, let's derive the output state:

1. The value of `i` remains 1 as it is not modified in the provided code snippet.
2. The value of `ans1` will be updated based on the condition `i + x < n`:
   - If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` becomes `ans1 (initial state) - a[1 + x] * 2`.
   - Otherwise, `ans1` becomes `ans1 (initial state) + a[1]`.
3. The value of `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of the new `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans1` is `ans1 (initial state) - a[1 + x] * 2` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1 (initial state) + a[1]`; `ans2` is `max(ans1 (new value), ans2 (initial state))`.**

In natural language, the output state is:
- `i` remains 1.
- `ans1` is recalculated based on the condition: if `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is reduced by `a[1 + x] * 2`; otherwise, `ans1` is increased by `a[1]`.
- `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of the newly calculated `ans1` and its previous value.
