Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * a[2 * x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.**
