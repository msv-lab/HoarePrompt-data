The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting `a[i] * 2` from it. Given the initial state, `ans1` is initially calculated as `sum(a) - a[i] * 2`. After the code execution, `ans1` will be reduced by an additional `a[i] * 2`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans1` will be:
\[ \text{new } ans1 = (\text{sum(a)} - a[i] * 2) - a[i] * 2 = \text{sum(a)} - a[i] * 4 \]

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` is the second integer read from the new input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `_`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - a[i] * 4`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the iterations, `_` is incremented by 1.**
