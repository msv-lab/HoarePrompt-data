### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x`, which represent the number of players, the number of throws, and the starting player, respectively.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing a distance `r` and a direction `c` (either '0', '1', or '?').

2. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball after the throw, depending on the direction:
     - If the direction is '0' (clockwise), it adds `(q + r) % n` to the set for each player `q` in `ans`.
     - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise), it adds `(q - r) % n` to the set for each player `q` in `ans`.
     - If the direction is '?', it adds both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the set for each player `q` in `ans`.

3. **Handling Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around correctly in the circle.
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if it is. This is because the modulo operation can result in `0`, which corresponds to player `n` in a 1-based index system.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all throws, the program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball (`len(ans)`) and the sorted list of these players.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  6 3 2
  2 ?
  2 ?
  2 ?
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - Initial `ans = {2}`.
  - First throw (`r = 2`, `c = '?'`):
    - Possible positions: `(2 + 2) % 6 = 4` and `(2 - 2) % 6 = 0` (which becomes `6`).
    - Updated `ans = {4, 6}`.
  - Second throw (`r = 2`, `c = '?'`):
    - Possible positions from `4`: `(4 + 2) % 6 = 0` (which becomes `6`), `(4 - 2) % 6 = 2`.
    - Possible positions from `6`: `(6 + 2) % 6 = 2`, `(6 - 2) % 6 = 4`.
    - Updated `ans = {2, 4, 6}`.
  - Third throw (`r = 2`, `c = '?'`):
    - Possible positions from `2`: `(2 + 2) % 6 = 4`, `(2 - 2) % 6 = 0` (which becomes `6`).
    - Possible positions from `4`: `(4 + 2) % 6 = 0` (which becomes `6`), `(4 - 2) % 6 = 2`.
    - Possible positions from `6`: `(6 + 2) % 6 = 2`, `(6 - 2) % 6 = 4`.
    - Updated `ans = {2, 4, 6}`.
- **Output:**
  ```
  3
  2 4 6
  ```

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after all the throws, considering the given directions and uncertainties.

**Correctness:** **True**
