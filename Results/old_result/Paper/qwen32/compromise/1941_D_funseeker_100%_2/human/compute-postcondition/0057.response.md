Output State: **`n`, `m` (which is `m - 1` and still greater than 0), and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing at least one value. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is either '0' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The condition `c == '1' or c == '?'` is true.**

In natural language: The value of `temp` has been updated to include the result of `(q - r) % n` in addition to its previous value of `(q + r) % n`. All other variables retain their initial states.
