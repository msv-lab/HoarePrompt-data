Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`. `m` is 0, `ans` contains all the results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` was '0') for all elements `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration except for `0`, `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`, `temp` is an empty set, and `ans` now includes `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `n` has been added to the set `ans`. The values of `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. The set `temp` is still empty.
