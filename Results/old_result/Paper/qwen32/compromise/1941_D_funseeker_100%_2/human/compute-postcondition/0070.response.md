Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`, `m` is 0, `ans` contains all the results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` was '0') for all elements `q` in the original `ans`, `r` and `c` are the values from the last call to `func_1()`, `temp` contains all the results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or just `(q + r) % n` if `c` was '0') for all elements `q` in the original `ans`.**

Natural Language: The variable `ans` is now updated to contain the same values as `temp`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `m`, `r`, `c`, and `temp`) retain their previous values.
