Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`; `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`; `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', then `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
