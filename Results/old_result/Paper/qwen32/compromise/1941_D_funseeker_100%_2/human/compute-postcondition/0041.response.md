The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which iterates over the elements of the set `ans`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `q` to the next element in `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`.
- `ans` is a set containing at least one element.
- `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `temp` is determined based on the value of `c` and the current `q`.
- `q` is an element from `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet.

At the start of the next iteration, `q` should be the next element from `ans` that hasn't been used in the previous iterations.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is the other split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `q` is the next element from `ans` that hasn't been iterated over yet. `temp` is determined based on the value of `c` and the new `q`.**
