The code snippet provided assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `x`. Since the specific implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, we can only infer that `func_3()` returns three values that will be assigned to `n`, `m`, and `x`.

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 <= m <= 1000), and `x` is an integer representing the initial player with the ball (1 <= x <= n). After the function call, these variables will be reassigned to the values returned by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.**
