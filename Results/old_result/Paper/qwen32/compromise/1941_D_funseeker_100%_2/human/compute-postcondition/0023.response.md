To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how the set `ans` evolves.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`.
- `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.
- `r` is the integer value obtained from splitting the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `temp` is an empty set.

### Loop Behavior:
- The loop iterates over each element `q` in the set `ans`.
- Depending on the value of `c`, it calculates `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` and adds these values to `temp`.
- After each iteration, the set `ans` is updated to include the elements in `temp`, and `temp` is cleared for the next iteration.

### Iteration Details:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `ans` contains `x`.
   - Depending on `c`, `temp` contains `(x + r) % n` and/or `(x - r) % n`.
   - `ans` is updated to include the elements in `temp`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `ans` now contains `x` and possibly `(x + r) % n` and/or `(x - r) % n`.
   - For each `q` in `ans`, `temp` is updated with `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n`.
   - `ans` is updated to include the elements in `temp`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `ans` now contains `x`, `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, and possibly other values calculated in the previous iterations.
   - For each `q` in `ans`, `temp` is updated with `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n`.
   - `ans` is updated to include the elements in `temp`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop continues until `ans` no longer changes, meaning all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` have been added to `ans`.
- `temp` will be empty at the end of each iteration, as it is cleared before the next iteration starts.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain the same as initially assigned.
- `r` and `c` remain the same as initially assigned.
- `ans` will contain all unique values that can be generated by repeatedly applying `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` starting from `x`.
- `temp` will be an empty set.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`. `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by repeatedly applying `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` starting from `x`. `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.**
