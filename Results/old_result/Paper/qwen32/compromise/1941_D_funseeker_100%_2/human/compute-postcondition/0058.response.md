Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` (which is `m - 1` and still greater than 0), and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing at least one value. `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is either '0' or '?'. If `c == '1' or c == '?'`, `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.***

Given the structure of the if-else statement and the provided postconditions for the if part, the overall postcondition combines the conditions and outcomes described:

- Regardless of the condition, `n`, `m` (which is `m - 1` and still greater than 0), and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` remains a set containing at least one value.
- `r` is an integer converted from the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `c` is either '0' or '?'.
- If `c == '1' or c == '?'`, `temp` is updated to include both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set, but since `c` is constrained to be '0' or '?', this case does not apply.

Therefore, the final postcondition is summarized as above.
