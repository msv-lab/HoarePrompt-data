The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop's continuation, we only need to consider `m` for adjusting the state.

Given that the loop runs `m` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. However, since the loop head only contains `_` and `m`, and `_` does not need to be adjusted, we only adjust `m`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m > 0`. `ans` is an empty set. `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.

Since the loop runs `m` times and we are at the start of the next iteration, `m` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

State: **`n`, `m` is `m - 1`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m - 1 > 0`. `ans` is an empty set. `r` is the integer value of the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`, and `c` is the split value from the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.**
