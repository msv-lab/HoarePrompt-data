Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for all iterations, where `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `k` is `len(a) - 1`; `i` and `j` are determined based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2` throughout the loop. The loop will execute one more time if the number of remaining iterations is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
