The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to it. The initial state provides the values of `t1` and `t2`, and `ans` is initially set to `max(t1, t2)`. After the code execution, `ans` will be the sum of its initial value and the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order.
- `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`.
- `k` is `len(a)`.
- `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`.
- `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.
- If `t2 > t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 1 or 2.

After the execution of `ans += max(t1, t2)`, the new value of `ans` will be `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, which simplifies to `2 * max(t1, t2)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is `2 * max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `len(a)`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2 > t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 1 or 2.**
