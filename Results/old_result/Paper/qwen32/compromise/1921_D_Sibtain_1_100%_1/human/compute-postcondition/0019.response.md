The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` is 1 and the first (and only) element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then all elements in `a` and `c` are the same. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and `a` is sorted. `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. The current value of `t2` is greater than `t1`.**
