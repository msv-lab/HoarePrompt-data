You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's), and n is initialized to 0 and ans is initialized to 0.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: s is the user input, n is 1, ans is 5.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a binary string from user input, processes it, and prints the computed value of `ans`, which represents the sum of counts of consecutive '1's incremented by one each time a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input an integer `t` and then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function itself does not return any value but may perform actions within `func_1` for each iteration.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string `s`, calculates the minimum cost to sort it, and prints the result.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t`, and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Logic
- Initialize `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
- Iterate through the string `s`:
  - If the current character is '1', increment `n`.
  - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not 0, add `n + 1` to `ans`.
- Print `ans`.

#### Correctness Analysis
The provided program seems to be based on a specific observation:
- When encountering a '0' after some '1's, the cost to move those '1's to the right of the '0' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one (to account for the cyclic shift).

Let's verify this logic with the example cases:

1. **Input: "10"**
   - `n` starts as 0.
   - First character is '1', so `n` becomes 1.
   - Second character is '0', so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

2. **Input: "0000"**
   - `n` remains 0 throughout.
   - No '1's encountered, so `ans` remains 0.
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

3. **Input: "11000"**
   - `n` becomes 2 after the first two '1's.
   - First '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Second '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - Third '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `6 + 3 + 1 = 10`.
   - Output: 10 (Incorrect, Expected: 9)

4. **Input: "101011"**
   - `n` becomes 1 after the first '1'.
   - First '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Second '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 2.
   - Second '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - Third '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 3.
   - Fourth '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 4.
   - Output: 5 (Incorrect, Expected: 11)

5. **Input: "01101001"**
   - `n` becomes 1 after the first '1'.
   - First '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Second '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 2.
   - Second '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - Third '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 3.
   - Third '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`.
   - Fourth '1' encountered, so `n` becomes 4.
   - Fifth '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `9 + 4 + 1 = 14`.
   - Sixth '0' encountered, so `ans` becomes `14 + 5 + 1 = 20`.
   - Output: 20 (Incorrect, Expected: 11)

From the above analysis, it is clear that the program does not produce the correct output for several test cases. The logic in `func_1()` does not correctly account for the minimum cost to sort the string in all cases.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect as it does not handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
