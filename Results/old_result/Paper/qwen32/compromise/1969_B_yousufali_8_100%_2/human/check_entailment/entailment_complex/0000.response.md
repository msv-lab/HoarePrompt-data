Reasoning: 

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The function `func_1` calculates a value based on the number of '1's encountered before a '0', but this does not represent the minimum cost to sort the string. The provided logic does not account for the actual operations needed to sort the string, nor does it calculate the cost of those operations.

For example, consider the test case `101011`. The provided function `func_1` would calculate `ans` as 5, but the correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, which can be achieved through a series of cyclic shifts, as described in the problem statement. However, the function's logic does not simulate these shifts or calculate the cost correctly.

The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each case, but since `func_1` itself is incorrect, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
