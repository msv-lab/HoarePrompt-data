To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze whether the algorithm implemented in `func_1` correctly computes the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operations.

The algorithm in `func_1` works as follows:
1. It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered.
2. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
3. It iterates through the string `s` character by character:
   - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
   - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero (i.e., there have been '1's before this '0'), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

The logic seems to be based on the idea that every '0' that appears after at least one '1' requires a cost of `n + 1` to move all the preceding '1's to its left, where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. For the string "10":
   - `n` starts at 0.
   - First character is '1', so `n` becomes 1.
   - Second character is '0', and `n` is not 0, so `ans` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
   - This matches the expected result of 2.

2. For the string "0000":
   - There are no '1's, so `n` remains 0.
   - No '0' requires any cost since there are no '1's to move.
   - This matches the expected result of 0.

3. For the string "11000":
   - `n` starts at 0.
   - First character is '1', so `n` becomes 1.
   - Second character is '1', so `n` becomes 2.
   - Third character is '0', and `n` is not 0, so `ans` becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
   - Fourth character is '0', and `n` is not 0, so `ans` becomes 3 + 2 = 5.
   - Fifth character is '0', and `n` is not 0, so `ans` becomes 5 + 3 = 8.
   - This does not match the expected result of 9.

The algorithm does not seem to correctly compute the cost for all cases. Specifically, the cost accumulation logic does not correctly handle the minimum cost for moving multiple '1's to the left of '0's in an optimal manner.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
