The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `b` and `c`. This means the original value of `b` (which was a binary string of length `m`) is overwritten by the new integer value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input; `c` is an integer read from input.**
