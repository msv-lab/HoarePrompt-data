To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables `j` and `k` evolve based on the conditions given.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `b-1` (inclusive). For each iteration `j`:

1. **Check if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`**:
   - If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` is determined, and `k` is updated to `k + index + 1`.
   - If the new `k` equals `c` or `j` is the last iteration (`j == b - 1`), `k` is set to `j + 1`, and the loop breaks.
   - If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j`, and the loop breaks.

2. **Loop Completion**:
   - If the loop completes all `b` iterations without breaking, `j` will be equal to `b` at the end. The final value of `k` depends on the last iteration.

### Output State Calculation

Given the conditions and the behavior of the loop, let's consider the final state:

- **`j`**: If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `j` will be equal to `b`. If the loop breaks early, `j` will be the value at which the loop breaks.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` at the end depends on the conditions inside the loop:
  - If the loop breaks because `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` will be set to `j`.
  - If the loop breaks because `k` equals `c` or `j` is the last iteration, `k` will be set to `j + 1`.
  - If the loop completes all iterations, `k` will be the value determined by the last iteration's condition.

### Final Output State

The final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

- `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is either `b` (if the loop completes all iterations) or the value at which the loop breaks.
- `k` is determined by the conditions inside the loop at the point of breaking or completion.

### Output State in the Required Format

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks; `k` is the value determined by the conditions inside the loop at the point of breaking or completion; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `j` will be `b` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it will be the value at which the loop breaks. `k` will be determined by the condition at the point of breaking or completion. All other variables remain unchanged except `i`, which is incremented by 1.
