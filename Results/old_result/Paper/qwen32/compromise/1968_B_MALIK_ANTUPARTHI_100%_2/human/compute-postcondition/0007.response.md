Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `k` is 0. Additionally, the character `d[j]` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`.**
