The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 2`. However, since the loop variable `j` is initialized from 0 in the loop head, we need to consider the actual value of `j` at the start of the next iteration, which will be the current value of `j` plus one.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the state at the beginning of the next iteration will have `j` increased by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.

So, if `j` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `(i + 1) + 1` which is `i + 2`. However, since `j` is the loop variable and starts from 0, the next value of `j` in the loop will simply be the current `j` plus one.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `j` is the value at which the loop breaks if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, `k` is `j + 1` if the loop breaks, and the loop breaks if either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. Otherwise, `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `j` is the value at which the loop breaks, and `k` is equal to `j`.**

Since `j` is the loop variable and starts from 0, the state at the beginning of the next iteration will have `j` incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.
