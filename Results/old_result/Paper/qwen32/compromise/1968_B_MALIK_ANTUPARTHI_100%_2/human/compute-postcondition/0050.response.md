Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `j` is the value at which the loop breaks if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, `k` is `j + 1` if the loop breaks, and the loop breaks if either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. Otherwise, `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `j` is the value at which the loop breaks, and `k` is equal to `j`.**
