The code assigns the value of `j` to `k`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `k` will hold the value of `j` before it was incremented. Therefore, `k` is equal to the previous value of `j`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `k` is equal to the previous value of `j`.**
