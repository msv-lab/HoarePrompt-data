Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If the character at index `j` of string `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`, then `j` is the value at which the loop breaks if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, and `k` is `j + 1` if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`. Otherwise, `j` is the value at which the loop breaks, `k` is equal to `j`, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`.**
