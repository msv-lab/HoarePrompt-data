The code snippet assigns the value of `j` to `k`. Therefore, `k` will have the same value as `j`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is `j`.**
