The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` based on the current value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` must be at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `j` equals `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, otherwise `j` is the value at which the loop breaks, `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `d[j]` is an element present in the substring `e[k:]`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.**
