The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value such that it has not yet reached `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5
- `a` is an integer greater than 0
- `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0
- `c` is an integer read from input
- `d` is an input string
- `e` is a string read from input

The state of variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `e` do not change based on the loop head, and only `j` is adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some value (let's call it `j_old`) such that `j_old < b`. For the next iteration, `j` should be `j_old + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is `j_old + 1` where `j_old` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration and `j_old < b`**.

Since we are only adjusting `j` and the exact value of `j_old` is not specified, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
