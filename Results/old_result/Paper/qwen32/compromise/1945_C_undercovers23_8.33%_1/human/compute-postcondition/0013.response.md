The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `lst`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`) are modified by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string provided by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.**
