Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; if `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing the single element `0`, otherwise `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; all elements of `lst` have been processed; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`.**

Natural Language: The variable `pk` is now set to half of the input integer `n`. All other variables retain their previous states.
