Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `math.ceil((zero + 1) * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` incremented by 1, and `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'.**
