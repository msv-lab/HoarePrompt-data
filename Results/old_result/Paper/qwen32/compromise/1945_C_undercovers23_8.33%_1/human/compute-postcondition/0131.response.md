The code sorts the list `final`. The sorting operation rearranges the elements of `final` in ascending order. The precondition that `final` contains all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini` remains valid. The only change is that the elements in `final` are now sorted.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini`.**
