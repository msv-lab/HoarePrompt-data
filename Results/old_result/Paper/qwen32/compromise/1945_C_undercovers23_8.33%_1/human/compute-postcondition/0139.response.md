Postcondition: **`final` is a sorted list. If `final` was initially empty, it now contains either one element `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or the single element `n` if `c1` is less than 50. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged as a sorted list containing elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini`.**
