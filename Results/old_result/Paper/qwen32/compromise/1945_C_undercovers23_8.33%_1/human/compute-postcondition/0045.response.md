The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `lst`. If `lst` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ele` was the last element processed from `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `lst` to process. Therefore, `ele` should be updated to the next element in `lst`.

Since we don't have specific values for `lst` or the current `ele`, we can denote the next element in `lst` as `next_ele`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is the length of the string `s`; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is the count of '0's encountered up to the second last character; `one` is the count of '1's encountered up to the second last character; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50 and contains at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of \(10^8\) and `abs(pk - ele)`; `ele` is `next_ele`**
