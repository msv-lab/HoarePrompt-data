The code assigns the value of `n // 2` to the variable `pk`. Given that `n` is an odd integer, `n // 2` will result in an integer division, effectively taking the floor of `n / 2`.

Since `n` is odd, `pk` will be the largest integer less than `n / 2`. For example, if `n` is 5, `pk` will be 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is an input integer and `n` is odd; `s` is the string provided by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`.**
