The given code snippet updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. 

Since the initial values of `mini`, `pk`, and `ele` are not specified, we can only express the new value of `mini` in terms of these variables.

The new value of `mini` will be `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`, `pk` is unchanged, `ele` is unchanged.**
