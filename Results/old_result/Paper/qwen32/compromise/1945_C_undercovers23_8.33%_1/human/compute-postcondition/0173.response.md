Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `t` is decremented by 1; `i` is 4; if `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by 2; otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((zero + 1) * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `zero` is incremented by 1, making it `zero + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `zero`, which now holds its previous value plus one. The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are recalculated using the updated value of `zero`. The conditions for including `i + 1` in `lst` are still based on the recalculated percentages.
