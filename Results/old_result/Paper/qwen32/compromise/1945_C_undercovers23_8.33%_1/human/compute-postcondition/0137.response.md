The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Initially, `final` was an empty list, so now it contains one element, which is `n`. The values of `c1` and the condition `c1 < 50` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing the single element `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `c1` is less than 50.**
