Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing the single element `0`. Otherwise, `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. All elements of `lst` have been processed.**
