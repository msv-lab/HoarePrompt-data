The code converts the string `s` into a list of characters and assigns it to the variable `sl`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `pk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string provided by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.**
