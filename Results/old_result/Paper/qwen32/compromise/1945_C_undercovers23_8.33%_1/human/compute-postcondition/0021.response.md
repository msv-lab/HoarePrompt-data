To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
```

This line calculates the percentage of zeros up to the current index `i` in the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `zero_perc`. The calculation involves:
- `zero`: which is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or not.
- `i`: the current index in the iteration over the string `s`.
- `math.ceil`: rounds the result of the division up to the nearest integer.

The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `lst`, and `mini` are not affected by this line of code. The variable `zero_perc` is newly introduced and calculated based on the current values of `zero` and `i`.

Given the initial state, the output state should reflect the new value of `zero_perc` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is \(10^8\), `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.**
