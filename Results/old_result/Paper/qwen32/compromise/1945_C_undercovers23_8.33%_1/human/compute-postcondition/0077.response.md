Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing the single element `0`, otherwise `final` is a sorted list containing the single element `n`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. All elements of `lst` have been processed. `t` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `s` is the user's input. `pk` is `n // 2`. The value of `pk` is calculated as `n // 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd.**
