The code appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `final` will contain one element, which is `elem`. The other variables (`lst`, `n`, `pk`, `ele`, `mini`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list with at least one element, `n` is the length of `lst`, `pk` is `n // 2`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing `elem`.**
