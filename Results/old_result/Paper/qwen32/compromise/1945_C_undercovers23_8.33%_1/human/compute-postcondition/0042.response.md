To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider how the variables evolve with each iteration of the loop. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\).
   - `n`: The length of the string `s`.
   - `s`: The input string.
   - `pk`: Half of `n` (integer division).
   - `sl`: A list of characters from the string `s`.
   - `o`: The count of '1's in `sl`.
   - `z`: The count of '0's in `sl`.
   - `zero`: Initialized to 0.
   - `one`: Initialized to 0.
   - `lst`: An empty list.
   - `mini`: Set to \(10^8\).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
   - For each iteration:
     - If `s[i]` is '0', increment `zero`.
     - Otherwise, increment `one`.
     - Calculate `zero_perc` as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
     - Calculate `one_perc` as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
     - If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, append `i + 1` to `lst`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 2`.
   - `zero` will be the total count of '0's encountered up to the second last character.
   - `one` will be the total count of '1's encountered up to the second last character.
   - `lst` will contain indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50.
   - All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is the length of the string `s`; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is the count of '0's encountered up to the second last character; `one` is the count of '1's encountered up to the second last character; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50; `mini` is \(10^8\).**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `zero` and `one` reflect the counts of '0's and '1's up to the second last character of the string, and `lst` contains the positions where the conditions on percentages were met. All other variables retain their initial values.
