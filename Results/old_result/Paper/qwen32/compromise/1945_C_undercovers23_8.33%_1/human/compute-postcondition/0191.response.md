The code appends the value of `elem` to the `final` list. This means that `final` will no longer be an empty list but will contain `elem` as its first (and currently only) element. All other variables (`t`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`, and `elem`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing `elem`; `t` has been decremented by `n - 1`; `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; the current value of `elem` satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
