The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list by subtracting the value of the element at index `i - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is `[0, 1, 2, 1]`
- `i` is `2`
- `n` is greater than `4`

Let's calculate the new value for `list[i + 1]`:
- `i + 1` is `3`
- `i - 1` is `1`
- `list[i - 1]` is `list[1]` which is `1`
- The operation `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` translates to `list[3] -= 1 * list[1]` which is `list[3] -= 1 * 1` or `list[3] -= 1`
- `list[3]` was `1`, and after the operation, it becomes `1 - 1` which is `0`

The updated `list` is now `[0, 1, 2, 0]`.

The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 1, 2, 0]`, `i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `4`**
