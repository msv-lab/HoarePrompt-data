The code snippet modifies the value at index `i` of the list by subtracting twice the value at index `i - 1`. Given the initial state, `list[i]` is `2` (at index `1`), and `list[i - 1]` is `1` (at index `0`). Therefore, `list[1]` is updated to `2 - 2 * 1`, which equals `0`.

Output State: **`list` is `[1, 0, 0]`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `4`**.
