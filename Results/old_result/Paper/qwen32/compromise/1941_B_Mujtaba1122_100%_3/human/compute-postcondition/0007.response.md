The code modifies the value at index `i` in the list by subtracting twice the value at index `i - 1`. Given the initial state, `list[i]` is `list[1]` which is `2`, and `list[i - 1]` is `list[0]` which is `1`. Therefore, `list[1]` becomes `2 - 2 * 1`, which is `0`.

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is [1, 0, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**.
