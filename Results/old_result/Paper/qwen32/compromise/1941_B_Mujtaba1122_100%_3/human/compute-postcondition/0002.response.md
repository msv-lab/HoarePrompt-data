The code modifies the value at index `i + 1` in the `list` by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `list[i + 1]` refers to `list[2]` and `list[i - 1]` refers to `list[0]`. The value at `list[0]` is 1, so the value at `list[2]` is decreased by 1.

Initial values: `list` is [1, 2, 1], `n` is 3, `i` is 1.

After the code executes, `list[2]` changes from 1 to 0.

Output State: **`list` is [1, 2, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**.
