The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about a list and a function call, but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of the list and the function evaluation result provided in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state mentions a list `[0, 0, 0]` and the evaluation of `func_1(list, n)` to `True`. However, these details are not used or referenced in the provided code snippet.
2. The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state, it will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
