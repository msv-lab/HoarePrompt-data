Output State: **`list` is [1, -1, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value at index `i` (which is 1) in the `list` is updated. The new value is calculated as the original value at index `i` minus twice the value at index `i-1`. So, `list[1]` becomes `2 - 2*1 = -1`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
