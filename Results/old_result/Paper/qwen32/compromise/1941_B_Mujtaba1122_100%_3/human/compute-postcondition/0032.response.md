Postcondition: **list is [0, 0, 0], i is 1, n is greater than 4, and the element at index 0 of list is not 0.**

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the given precondition and if condition. The precondition states that `list` is `[0, 0, 0]`, which means `list[i - 1]` (where `i` is 1) will always be 0, and thus the if condition can never be true. If we assume there is an error in the precondition and you want me to calculate the postcondition based on the if condition being true, we can proceed as follows:

Postcondition: **list is [non-zero, 0, 0], i is 1, n is greater than 4, and the element at index 0 of list is not 0.**

This postcondition assumes that the if condition is true, meaning the first element of `list` is not 0, which contradicts the initial precondition. Please clarify if you need a different interpretation or if there is an error in the precondition.
