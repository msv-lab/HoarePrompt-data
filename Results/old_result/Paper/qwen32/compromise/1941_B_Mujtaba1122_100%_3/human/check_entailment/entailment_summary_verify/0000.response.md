### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summaries in detail to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Rudolf can perform an operation on an array `a` by choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and updating `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` as follows:
- `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`
- `a_i = a_i - 2`
- `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`

The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation any number of times.

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
    - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function attempts to apply the operation described in the problem statement.
    - It iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` and applies the operation while the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are satisfied.
    - However, the operation is incorrectly implemented:
        - Instead of decrementing `list[i+1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, the code multiplies these values by `list[i-1]`.
        - This results in incorrect updates to the array elements.
    - If `list[i-1]` is not zero after the loop, it immediately prints 'no' and returns.
    - Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Operation Implementation**: The operation is not applied as described in the problem statement.
- **Premature Termination**: The function may terminate prematurely if `list[i-1]` is not zero after the first loop iteration, without fully attempting to reduce the array to zero.
- **Output Handling**: The function prints 'no' and returns if `list[i-1]` is not zero, which is not consistent with the problem's requirement to check the entire array.

#### Correct Implementation:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the implementation. The operation should be applied correctly, and the entire array should be checked to determine if it can be reduced to zero.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the described operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
