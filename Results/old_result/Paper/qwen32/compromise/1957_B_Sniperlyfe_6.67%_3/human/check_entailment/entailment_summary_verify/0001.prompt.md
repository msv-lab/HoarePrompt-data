You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list to be returned and `k` is an integer. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` such that the first `n-1` elements are the largest possible value with the same number of bits as the initial `k` (i.e., `2^b - 1`), and the last element is this value plus the remaining `k` after reducing `k` by the sum of the first `n-1` elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Sum Constraint:** The sequence \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) must satisfy \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = k\).
2. **Maximize 1s in Binary OR:** The number of 1s in the binary representation of \( a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n \) should be maximized.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:** The program initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
2. **Filling the List:** It iterates `n` times, setting each element to \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\). This value is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` (all bits set to 1), minus 1. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), the value used would be `111` (binary for 7) minus 1, which is `110` (binary for 6).
3. **Adjusting the Last Element:** After the loop, it adds the remaining value of `k` to the last element of the list to ensure the sum is exactly `k`.
4. **Return:** The constructed list is returned.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Sum Constraint:** The program does not guarantee that the sum of the elements in `nums` equals `k`. The subtraction `k -= nums[i]` may result in a negative `k` if `nums[i]` is larger than `k`, which is not handled properly.
2. **Maximizing 1s in Binary OR:** The strategy of setting each element to a large number with many 1s does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary OR of the entire list. For example, setting all elements to a large number with many 1s might lead to some elements being set to zero, which does not contribute to the OR operation.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the binary OR of the sequence, we should distribute the bits of `k` across the elements in such a way that the OR of all elements has the maximum number of 1s. This can be achieved by setting each element to the largest possible power of 2 that does not exceed the remaining `k` and ensuring that the sum is exactly `k`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
