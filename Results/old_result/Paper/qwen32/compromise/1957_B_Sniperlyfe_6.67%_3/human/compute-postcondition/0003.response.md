The code snippet `nums[-1] += k` increases the last element of the list `nums` by the value of `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged except that `k` will be conceptually reduced by the value added to `nums[-1]` as per the precondition. The last element of `nums` is now the sum of its original value and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, but `k` will be reduced by the sum of the values assigned to `nums`; `nums` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the largest possible value with the same number of bits as `k` at the start of that iteration, and `nums[-1]` is increased by `k`.**
