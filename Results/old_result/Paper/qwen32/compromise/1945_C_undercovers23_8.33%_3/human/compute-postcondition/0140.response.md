To determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the conditions leading up to this point:

1. **Initialization and Input:**
   - `n` is an integer input by the user, and it is at least 2.
   - `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `s` is another string input by the user.
   - `pk` is calculated as `n // 2`.

2. **Character Counts:**
   - `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`.
   - `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`.
   - `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s`.

3. **Sub-string Character Counts:**
   - `zero` is the count of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`.
   - `one` is the count of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`.

4. **List and Minimum Calculation:**
   - `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50.
     - `zero_perc` is calculated as `(zero / (n-1)) * 100`.
     - `one_perc` is calculated as `(one / (n-1)) * 100`.
   - `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.

5. **Final List Determination:**
   - `i` is set to `n - 2`.
   - If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
   - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is set to a sorted list containing `[0]`.
   - Otherwise, `final` is set to a sorted list containing `[n]`.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(final[0])` will print the first (and only) element of the `final` list.

Given the above steps, the value of `final[0]` depends on the value of `c1`:
- If `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` will be `[0]`.
- Otherwise, `final` will be `[n]`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(final[0])` statement will either be `0` or `n` based on the percentage of '1's in the string `s`.

Output: **0 if `o * 100 // n` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise n**
