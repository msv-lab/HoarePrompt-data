The code appends `elem` to the `final` list. Since `elem` is already defined as `lst[n - 1]`, the `final` list will now contain this element.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` contains at least one more index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `i` is `n - 2`, `elem` is `lst[n - 1]`, `final` is a list containing `elem`.**

In simple terms, the `final` list now includes the last element of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
