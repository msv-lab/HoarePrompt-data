The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If `lst` has more than one element, the loop will execute again for the next element in `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` was the second element in `lst`, and `i` was `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` should be the next element in `lst` (the third element if it exists).

Let's denote the next element in `lst` as `next_elem`. Since `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, and it has at least one element, we need to ensure that `lst` has at least two elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user such that there exists at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least two elements; `i` is `n - 2`; `elem` is the third element in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise `final` remains an empty list.**

Note: The state of `i` does not affect the loop directly, but it is included in the state description as per the given information.
