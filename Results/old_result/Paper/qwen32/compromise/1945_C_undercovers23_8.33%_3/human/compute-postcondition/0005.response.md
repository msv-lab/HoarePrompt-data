The value of `pk` is assigned the result of `n // 2`. Since `n` is an even integer, `pk` will be an integer representing half of `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the even integer input by the user; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`.**
