Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1. `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `zero_perc` is updated to the ceiling of `zero` multiplied by 100 divided by `i + 1`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `zero`, `one`) retain their previous states with the exception of `zero_perc` which now holds the newly calculated percentage.
