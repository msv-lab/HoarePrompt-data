Postcondition: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100) / (i + 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` now includes `i + 1` as its last element.**
