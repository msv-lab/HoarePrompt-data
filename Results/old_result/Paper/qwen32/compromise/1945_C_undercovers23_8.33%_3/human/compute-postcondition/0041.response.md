Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`; otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.**
