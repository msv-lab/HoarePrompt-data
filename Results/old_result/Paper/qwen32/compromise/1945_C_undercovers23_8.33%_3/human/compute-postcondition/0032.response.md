The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given the initial state, `lst` initially contains `i + 1` if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, otherwise it is empty. After executing the code, `lst` will definitely contain `i + 1` as the last element.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` appended to its previous contents; `mini` is 100000000; `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
