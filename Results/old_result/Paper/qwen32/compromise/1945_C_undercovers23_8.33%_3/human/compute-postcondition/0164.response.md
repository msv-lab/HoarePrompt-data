To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` and `n`.

Given:
- `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2.
- The loop iterates over `range(n - 1)`, meaning `i` ranges from 0 to `n - 2`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and `n` remains unchanged.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `0 <= k < n - 1`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

No changes are needed for `n` since it remains constant throughout the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k` (which is the previous value of `i`), we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

For clarity, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then:

State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**. 

But sticking to the general form without specific variable names for the previous iteration value:

State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
