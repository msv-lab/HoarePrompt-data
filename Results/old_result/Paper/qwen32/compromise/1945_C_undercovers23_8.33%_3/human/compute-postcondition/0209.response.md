To determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`final` List**: 
   - `final` is a list of indices from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
   - If `len(final) == 0` (i.e., no indices meet the condition), `final` is updated based on the value of `c1`.
     - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `final` becomes `[n]`.

2. **`c1` Calculation**:
   - `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.

3. **Printing `final[0]`**:
   - Since `final` is guaranteed to have at least one element (either because it was populated with indices or updated to `[0]` or `[n]`), `final[0]` will always exist.
   - We need to determine the value of `final[0]` based on the conditions.

Let's break down the possibilities:

- **Case 1**: `len(final) > 0`
  - In this case, `final` contains indices from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
  - Therefore, `final[0]` will be the first such index.

- **Case 2**: `len(final) == 0`
  - Here, `final` is updated based on the value of `c1`.
    - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`.
    - Otherwise, `final` becomes `[n]`.
  - Thus, `final[0]` will be either `0` or `n` depending on the value of `c1`.

Given the above analysis, the output of `print(final[0])` depends on the initial conditions and the value of `c1`. However, we can provide a precise description based on the given information.

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is the first index from lst where abs(pk - elem) == mini, or 0 if c1 >= 50 and len(final) == 0, or n if c1 < 50 and len(final) == 0)**
