To determine the new output state, we need to focus on the line of code provided:

```python
mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
```

This line updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. 

Given the initial state, we know:
- `mini` is initially set to `100000000`.
- `pk` is `n // 2`, where `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2.
- `ele` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state, so we assume it is a variable that holds some integer value.

Since `ele` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot compute a specific numeric value for `abs(pk - ele)`. However, we can express the updated value of `mini` in terms of `pk` and `ele`.

The updated value of `mini` will be the smaller of its current value (`100000000`) and `abs(pk - ele)`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s`, `mini` is `min(100000000, abs(pk - ele))`, `zero` is the count of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `i` is `n - 2`**.
