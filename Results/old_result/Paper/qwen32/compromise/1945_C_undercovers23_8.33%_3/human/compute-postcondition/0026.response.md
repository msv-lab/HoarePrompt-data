The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value such that the loop has just completed its current iteration. Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive), the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be incremented by 1.

Given that the loop condition is `for i in range(n - 1)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should simply be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains empty; `mini` is 100000000; `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 if `s[i]` is '1'; `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 if `s[i]` is '1'; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1**
