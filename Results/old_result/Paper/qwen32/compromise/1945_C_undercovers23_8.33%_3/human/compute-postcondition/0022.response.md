Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000; if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0; if `s[i]` is '1', `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)); `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**

Explanation: The variable `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
