Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the percentages of zeros and ones on each side of the road, and it does not handle the edge cases where the road might be placed before the first house or after the last house.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using percentages, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Instead, it should directly compare the counts of zeros and ones to their respective thresholds (`ceil(i/2)` for the left side and `ceil((n-i)/2)` for the right side).

2. **Threshold Calculation**: The thresholds for the number of zeros and ones on each side should be calculated using `math.ceil(i/2)` and `math.ceil((n-i)/2)` instead of percentages.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly handle the cases where the road is placed before the first house or after the last house. It should check if placing the road at these positions satisfies the conditions.

4. **Optimization**: The code uses a list to store valid positions and then finds the minimum distance from the middle. This can be optimized by keeping track of the best position directly during the iteration.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        zero, one = 0, 0
        best_i = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        # Check placing the road before the first house
        if one >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            best_i = 0
            min_diff = abs(0 - n // 2)
        
        # Check placing the road after the last house
        if zero >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            diff = abs(n - n // 2)
            if diff < min_diff:
                best_i = n
                min_diff = diff
        
        # Check placing the road between houses
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil(i + 1) / 2 and one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                diff = abs(i + 1 - n // 2)
                if diff < min_diff:
                    best_i = i + 1
                    min_diff = diff
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the conditions and edge cases, ensuring that the road is placed optimally according to the problem description.
