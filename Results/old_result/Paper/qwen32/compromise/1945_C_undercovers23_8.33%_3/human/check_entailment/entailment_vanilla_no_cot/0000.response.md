Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages multiplied by 100, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem requirements. The conditions should be checked directly using the ceiling function on the counts rather than percentages.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road might be placed before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`). These cases need to be explicitly checked.

3. **Optimization**: The code unnecessarily calculates the percentage for every position and then finds the minimum distance. This can be optimized by checking the conditions directly and keeping track of the best position as it iterates through the list.

4. **Final Decision Logic**: The logic for deciding whether to place the road before the first house or after the last house when no valid position is found is incorrect. It should check if placing the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        zero, one = 0, s.count('1')
        best_i = None
        min_dist = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i > 0 and s[i - 1] == '0':
                zero += 1
            elif i > 0 and s[i - 1] == '1':
                one -= 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil(i / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i) / 2):
                dist = abs(n / 2 - i)
                if dist < min_dist or (dist == min_dist and i < best_i):
                    min_dist = dist
                    best_i = i
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This corrected version handles the edge cases properly, checks the conditions directly using the ceiling function, and keeps track of the best position as it iterates through the list.
