The code snippet provided appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is equal to `bets`, this means the `bets`-th element of the list `a` is being appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user such that `bets` > 0, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements have been updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the original list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of the updated `a` list, and `sumo` is less than `prod`; `ans` is a string containing the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `bets`, `ans` is updated to include `str(a[bets]) + ' '`**.

In simpler terms, the string `ans` now includes the string representation of the `bets`-th element of the list `a` followed by a space, while all other variables remain unchanged.
