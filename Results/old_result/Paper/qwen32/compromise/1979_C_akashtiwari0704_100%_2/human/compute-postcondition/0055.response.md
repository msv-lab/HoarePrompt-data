Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`, `sumo` is 0, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each of the first `bets` elements of `a` separated by spaces, `l` is a list with at least one element.**

In this output state, the value of `sumo` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
