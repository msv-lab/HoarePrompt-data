Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the two integers in the current tuple `val_b` from `sec_arr`. The current tuple `val_b` from `sec_arr` satisfies the condition that the sum of its two integers is greater than or equal to 0.**

In simpler terms, `sub_summ` has been updated to include the sum of both integers in the current tuple `val_b` from `sec_arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
