The function takes two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob. It calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and adds to it the sum of the sums of the elements in each tuple from `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is non-negative. The function returns this calculated sum.
