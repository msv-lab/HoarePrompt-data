### Reasoning:

Let's dissect the problem and analyze the code to determine if it correctly computes Alice's maximum profit under the described conditions.

#### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of items.
     - `k`: Number of items Bob can take for free.
     - `a`: List of prices for Alice.
     - `b`: List of prices for Bob.

2. **Objective:**
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit.
   - Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
   - Alice's profit is calculated as the sum of Bob's payments minus Alice's initial expenditures.

3. **Constraints:**
   - Bob can take up to `k` items for free if Alice buys less than `k` items.
   - If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob takes `k` items for free and pays for the rest.

#### Code Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The prices for Alice (`a`) are negated to facilitate the use of a max-heap via `heapq`.
   - The items are stored in a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple is `(-a[i], b[i])`.
   - The list `arr` is sorted based on `b[i]` in ascending order.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Bob will take `k` items for free if Alice buys `k` or more items.
   - Alice should aim to maximize her profit by choosing items such that the net gain `(b[i] - a[i])` is maximized.
   - The code uses a max-heap (`k_arr`) to keep track of the `k` items with the highest `b[i]` values that Alice can potentially sell to Bob.

4. **Calculating Profit:**
   - The function `func_3` calculates the maximum profit by summing the negated `a` values from the `k_arr` (which represents the items Bob takes for free) and adding the net gains from the remaining items in `main_ar` where the net gain `(a[i] + b[i])` is non-negative.

#### Issues in the Code

1. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The code pushes the `k` items with the smallest `b[i]` values into `k_arr` instead of the `k` items with the highest `b[i]` values. This is incorrect because Bob will choose the `k` items with the highest `b[i]` values to minimize Alice's profit.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` incorrectly calculates the profit by summing the negated `a` values from `k_arr` and adding the net gains from `main_ar`. This does not account for the fact that Bob will choose the `k` items with the highest `b[i]` values to take for free.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The code uses `heapq.heappushpop` to maintain the `k` items with the highest `b[i]` values, but it should be done correctly to ensure that the heap contains the `k` items with the highest `b[i]` values.

#### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
