To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the computation involved:

1. **Variables and Initializations:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is set to the same integer value as `t`.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.

2. **Computation of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is computed by iterating over each element `x` in the list `cnt` and summing up the value of `max(0, x - 1)`.
   - `max(0, x - 1)` means that if `x` is greater than 1, it contributes `x - 1` to the sum; otherwise, it contributes 0.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the computed sum as described above.

Given the initial state, we do not have specific values for `t`, `a`, and `cnt`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for each x in cnt)**
