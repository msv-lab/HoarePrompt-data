Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the same integer value as `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers; `ans` is updated to `ans + max(0, x - 1)`; `x` is the next element in `cnt`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the maximum of `0` and `x - 1`, where `x` is the next element in the list `cnt`. All other variables retain their initial values.
