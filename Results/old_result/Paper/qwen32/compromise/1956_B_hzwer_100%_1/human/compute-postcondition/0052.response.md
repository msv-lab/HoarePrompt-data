The code snippet sets `ans` to 0. This means the previous value of `ans` is overwritten and set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the same integer value as `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each index `i` contains the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`; `ans` is 0.**
