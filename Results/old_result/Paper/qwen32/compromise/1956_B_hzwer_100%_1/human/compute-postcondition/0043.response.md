The given code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means the value of `a` changes to the newly read list, while the values of `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the same integer value as `t`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.**
