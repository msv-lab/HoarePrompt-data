The code snippet sets `ans` to 0, which overrides its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `t`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers representing the frequency of each integer in `a`, and `ans` is 0.**
