The provided code snippet only includes `input = sys.stdin.readline`. This line assigns the function `sys.stdin.readline` to the variable `input`. It does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `a` directly. The precondition about `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The variable `input` is now assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`.**
