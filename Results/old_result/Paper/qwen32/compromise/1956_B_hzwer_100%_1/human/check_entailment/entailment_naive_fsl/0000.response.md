Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a deck of `2n` cards with integers from `1` to `n`, each appearing exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed between two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards.
- Players take turns placing cards on the table. If a card with the same number is already on the table, the player scores a point.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- We need to determine the maximum number of points you can score assuming optimal play from both sides.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and calculates the maximum number of points you can get. Here's the core logic:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Program:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: The program counts how many times each number appears in your hand using a list `cnt`.
2. **Calculating Points**: For each unique number, if it appears more than once (`x > 1`), it means you can score a point for the second occurrence. The expression `max(0, x - 1)` effectively counts the number of pairs for each number.
3. **Summing Points**: The total points you can score is the sum of these pair counts.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Optimal Play Assumption**: The program assumes that you will always play optimally, which is reasonable because the problem asks for the maximum points you can get assuming optimal play from both sides.
- **Handling All Cases**: The program correctly handles the scenario where each number can appear at most twice. If a number appears twice, you can score one point for the second occurrence.
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If a number appears only once, you cannot score any points for that number.
  - If all numbers appear twice, you can score one point per number, which is the maximum possible under optimal play.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score under the given constraints and assumptions. It handles all edge cases and scenarios described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly counts the number of pairs in your hand and sums them up to determine the maximum number of points you can score, assuming optimal play from both sides. This aligns with the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.
