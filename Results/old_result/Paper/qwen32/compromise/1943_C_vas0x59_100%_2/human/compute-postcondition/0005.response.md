The value of `v` is decremented by 1. The values of `u2vs` and `u` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where `n` is at least 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where `n` is at least 2; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.**
