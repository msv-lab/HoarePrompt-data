The code snippet appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `c1` and `i` are already defined based on the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `previous` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `path_ba` is a list with more than one element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and the newly appended `(c1, i)`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `i` is `i + 2`.**
