The code appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the `u2vs` list. Initially, the list at index `v` contains the values `[v, u]`. After appending `u`, the list at index `v` will contain `[v, u, u]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the values `v` and `v`, the list at index `v` contains the values `v`, `u`, and `u`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 2; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 2.**
