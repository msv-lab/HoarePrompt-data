Initial State: 
- `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is a list of adjacency lists representing the tree.
- `d` remains unchanged as it is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is the return value of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` remains unchanged as it is the list of previous vertices for the shortest path tree.
- `b` remains unchanged as it is also the return value of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` will be a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, i.e., `path_ba` will be `[b, previous[b], previous[previous[b]], ..., a]`.

Code:
```python
ops = []
```

The code snippet initializes an empty list named `ops`. This does not affect any of the other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, or `path_ba`). The only change is the introduction of the new variable `ops` with an empty list as its value.

Natural Language Explanation:
The output state after executing the code is that `ops` is an empty list. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, and `path_ba`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` remains unchanged as it is a list of adjacency lists representing the tree; `d` remains unchanged as it is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices; `a` remains unchanged as it is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` remains unchanged as it is the list of previous vertices for the shortest path tree; `b` remains unchanged as it is also the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` will be a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list.**
