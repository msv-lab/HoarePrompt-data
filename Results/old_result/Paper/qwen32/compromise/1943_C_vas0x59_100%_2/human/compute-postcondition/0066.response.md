The code snippet appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. This changes the content of `ops` by adding one more element to it. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci2`, `ci1`, `c1`, `c2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `previous` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `path_ba` is a list with more than one element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and `(c1, i)`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `i` is `i + 4` (if `i + 4 < len(path_ba) - ci1`)**.
