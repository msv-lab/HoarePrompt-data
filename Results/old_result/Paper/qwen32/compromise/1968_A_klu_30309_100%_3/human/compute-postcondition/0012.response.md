The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. Since the loop is iterating from `x - 1` down to `1` with a step of `-1`, at the end of the last iteration, `y` was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be decremented by 1 again from its current value.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `y` was some value, for the next iteration, `y` should be one less than that value.

State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `y` is decremented by 1**.

Since we need to specify the exact state of `y` at the start of the next iteration, let's denote the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration as `y_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `y_prev - 1`.

State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `y` is `y_prev - 1`**.

However, since we don't have the specific value of `y_prev`, we can just say that `y` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `y` is decremented by 1**.

To make it clear and specific for the next iteration, if `y` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be 2. So let's denote the specific state:

State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `y` is `y - 1`**

If we assume `y` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `y` is 2**.

But generally, without specific values:

State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `y` is decremented by 1**.
