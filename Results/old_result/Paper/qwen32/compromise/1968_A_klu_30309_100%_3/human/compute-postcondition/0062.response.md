Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is 1, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

In this output state, `max_sum` has been updated to the value of `current_sum`, which is `gcd_val + y`. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
