Postcondition: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 2`, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `x` and `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y - 2)`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (y - 2)` and `best_y` is updated to `y`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
