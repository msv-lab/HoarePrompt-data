To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop:

The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x-1` down to `1`. For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`, computes `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`, and checks if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. If it is, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. The loop breaks immediately after updating `max_sum` and `best_y` for the first time it finds a `current_sum` greater than `max_sum`.

Since the loop breaks after the first update of `max_sum` and `best_y`, the loop will only run until it finds the first `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y`.

**Output State:**
- `t`: remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000)
- `test_cases`: remains unchanged (list of integers with at least one integer x where 2 <= x <= 1000)
- `results`: will contain the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`
- `max_sum`: will be the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found for the current `x`
- `best_y`: will be the `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y` for the current `x`

Given that the loop breaks after the first update of `max_sum` and `best_y`, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `test_cases` is unchanged, `results` contains the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found for the last `x` processed, and `best_y` is the `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y` for the last `x` processed.**
