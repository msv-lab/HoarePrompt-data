Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least one integer x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `best_y` is the `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The loop breaks after the first update of `max_sum` and `best_y`, so only the first `x` in `test_cases` is processed. The `results` list is updated to include `best_y` for this `x`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
