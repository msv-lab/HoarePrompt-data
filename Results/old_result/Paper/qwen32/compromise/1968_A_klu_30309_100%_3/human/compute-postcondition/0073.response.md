The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. The loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, and it continues as long as `y` is greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` was `y - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1 again, so the new value of `y` should be `(y - 1) - 1` or simply `y - 2`.

State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` and `best_y` are updated if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`**.

However, since `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted in the state description for the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 2`**.
