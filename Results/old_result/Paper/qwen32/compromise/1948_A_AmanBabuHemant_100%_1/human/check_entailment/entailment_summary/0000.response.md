Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is odd by printing 'NO' since an odd number of special characters cannot be formed with the pattern 'AAB'. For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating 'AAB', which ensures that exactly `n` special characters are present in the string. The length of the string is also checked to ensure it does not exceed 200 characters, although the pattern 'AAB' repeated up to `n // 2` times will never exceed 200 characters given the constraint `1 <= n <= 50`. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
