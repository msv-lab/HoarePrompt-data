The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 0 (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` such that `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`, `k` is 0, `j` is 1**.
