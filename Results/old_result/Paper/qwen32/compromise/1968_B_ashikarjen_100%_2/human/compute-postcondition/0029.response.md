Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` now equals `m + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previous states as described in the initial conditions.
