The code snippet `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged or follow their previously defined conditions. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1.**
