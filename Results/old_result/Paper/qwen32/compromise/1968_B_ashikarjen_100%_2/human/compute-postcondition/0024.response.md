To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `j`, `m`, and `b[j]` and `a[i]`.

Here is the loop condition:
```
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains unchanged (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `n` remains unchanged (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `m` is at least 2.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `b[1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
1. `j < m`
2. `b[j] != a[i]`

Since `j` is 2, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 2 to satisfy `j < m`.

The condition `b[j] != a[i]` is already satisfied because `b[1] != a[i]` and `j` is now 2. However, since `j` is 2, we need to ensure that `b[2] != a[i]` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, we need to adjust `m` to be greater than 2 and ensure that `b[2] != a[i]`.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `b[2]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
