You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The next line contains the binary string a of length n, and the following line contains the binary string b of length m. It is guaranteed that the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b` remain unchanged; `k` is the number of characters in `a` found in `b` in order; `j` is the index in `b` where the search stopped.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` found in `b` in order)
    return
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. It also receives the binary strings `a` and `b` themselves. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
