The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is initially 0, so after the increment, `j` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` is at least 1, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `b[0]` is not equal to `a[i]`**
