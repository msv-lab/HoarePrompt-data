To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop conditions and the provided output states.

The loop condition is:
```python
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    j += 1
```

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After the first iteration, `j` is 1, and `b[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`.
- After the second iteration, `j` is 2, and `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`.
- After the third iteration, `j` is 3, and `b[2]` is not equal to `a[1]`.

This implies that the loop will continue to increment `j` as long as `j < m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

The loop will terminate when either:
1. `j` reaches `m`, or
2. `b[j]` equals `a[i]`.

Since the loop has executed 3 times and `b[2]` is not equal to `a[1]`, the loop will continue until one of the termination conditions is met.

Given the information, the loop will continue until `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. If none of the elements `b[0]` to `b[m-1]` equal `a[i]`, then `j` will reach `m`.

Thus, the final state of `j` will be `m`, and `i` will remain 1 as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain the same as they were initially. The variable `i` remains 1, and `j` reaches the value of `m` because either `b[j]` equals `a[i]` at some point, or `j` reaches `m` without finding a match.
