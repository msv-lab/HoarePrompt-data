The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 0 (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `b` is a binary string of length `m` such that `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]` and `b[1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `k` is 0, `j` is 2**
