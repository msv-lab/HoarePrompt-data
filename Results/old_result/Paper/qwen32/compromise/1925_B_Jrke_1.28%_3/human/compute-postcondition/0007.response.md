Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. If `k` is 1, then the current value of `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` remains the integer division of `x` by `n` without any further changes; `ans` is 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` has been set to 1. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `k`) retain their initial values and conditions.
