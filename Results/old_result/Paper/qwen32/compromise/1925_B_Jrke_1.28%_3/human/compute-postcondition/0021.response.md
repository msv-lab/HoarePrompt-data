The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The value of `i` is `i + 2`, which means `i` has already been incremented by 2 before the append operation. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and the new value of `i`.**
