Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` contains `ans` and possibly `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `l` contains `ans` and no additional elements are added.**
