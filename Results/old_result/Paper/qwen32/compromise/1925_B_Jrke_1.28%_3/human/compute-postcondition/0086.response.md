Postcondition: **`ans` is 1, `x` is at least 4 if `x` is even or at least 1 if `x` is odd, `n` is any value, `k` is `x // n`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`. Additionally, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is `[1, i]`. Otherwise, `l` remains `[1]`.**
