Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum value among 1, all odd divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `x // n`, and their corresponding quotients `x // i` that are also less than or equal to `x // n`.**
