Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is now the result of `x` divided by `n` using integer division. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
