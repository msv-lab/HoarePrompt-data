The code `k = x // n` performs integer division of `x` by `n`, and assigns the result to `k`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, but `k` is now assigned the result of the integer division.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`.**
