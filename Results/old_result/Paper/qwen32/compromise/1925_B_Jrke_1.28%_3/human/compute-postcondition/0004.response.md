The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`) and their constraints, but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It directly outputs the number `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
2. The variables `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8.
3. The variable `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and its current value is 1.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
