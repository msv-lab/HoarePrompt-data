Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), `l` is a list containing the value 1, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
