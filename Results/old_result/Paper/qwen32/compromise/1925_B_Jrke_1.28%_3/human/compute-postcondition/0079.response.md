Postcondition: **`ans` is the maximum value among 1 and all valid divisors `i` and `x // i` that are less than or equal to `k`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`. `x` and `n` are the values obtained from the input; `k` is `x // n`. If `k` is not equal to 1, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify the state.**
