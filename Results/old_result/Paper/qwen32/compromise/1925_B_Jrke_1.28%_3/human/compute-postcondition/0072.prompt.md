Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`. If `k` equals 1, then no further changes are made to `x`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `x`, `n`, or `k`. `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the maximum of `[1, x // i]`. If `x % i == 0`, `l` is defined as per the condition involving `i` and `k`. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 2, and `l` is a list. If `x % i == 0`, `l` contains the value of `ans`. If `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `i`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` contains `ans` and possibly `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `l` contains `ans` and no additional elements are added.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
