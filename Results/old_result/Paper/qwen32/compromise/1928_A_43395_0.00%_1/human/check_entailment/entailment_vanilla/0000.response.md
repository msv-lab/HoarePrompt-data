Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob can form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles if:
- He can cut the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- These two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

### Key Observations:
- If either dimension of the original rectangle is 1, then it cannot be cut into two distinct rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are even, then the rectangle can always be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, then the rectangle can also be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, then the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of size 1x(odd), which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic to Determine if a New Rectangle Can Be Formed:**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If they are, it prints "yes".
   - It then checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`. This condition is incorrect and doesn't make sense as it is comparing a tuple to a boolean value, and it doesn't implement the correct logic.
   - It then checks if `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`. This condition is always true if `a` and `b` are not equal, so it doesn't correctly determine the case where both dimensions are odd.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "no".

### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
- The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true if `a` and `b` are not equal, which is not the correct logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.
- The program doesn't correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd.

### Correct Logic:
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, print "no".
- If both `a` and `b` are not 1, print "yes".

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

Correctness: **False**
