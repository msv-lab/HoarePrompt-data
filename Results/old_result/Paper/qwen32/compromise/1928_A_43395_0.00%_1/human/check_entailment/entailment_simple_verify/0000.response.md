Let's analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b` and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then wants to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. Two rectangles that are 90Â° rotations of each other are considered the same.

### Key Points
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to form a new rectangle.
2. If either `a` or `b` is even, it is possible to form a new rectangle.

### Program Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Annotations
- The annotations state the initial conditions and the state after processing each test case, but they do not provide detailed evaluation of the logic within the conditions.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`**:
   - This condition is logically incorrect. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` evaluates to a tuple `(False, a)` if `a - b != -a`, and `(True, a)` if `a - b == -a`. Similarly for `(b - a == -b, b)`.
   - This condition will always be `True` because the tuple will always contain at least one `True` value (the second element of the tuple is always `a` or `b`).

2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**:
   - This condition is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` can only be `0`, `1`, or `-1`. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` will be `True` for any non-zero value of `(a - b) % 2`, which means it will always be `True` for any `a` and `b` that are not equal.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should be to check if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it is possible to form a new rectangle.

### Corrected Program
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Evaluation Based on Annotations
- The annotations do not provide detailed insights into the logical flow and correctness of the conditions.
- Given the issues identified in the program, the annotations do not sufficiently validate the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is **correct** because the program does not handle all cases correctly and contains logical errors.

Final: **False**
