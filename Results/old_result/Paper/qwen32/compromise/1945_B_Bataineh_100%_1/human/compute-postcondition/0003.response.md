The function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. The constraints are that `1 <= t <= 10^4` and for each test case, `1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
