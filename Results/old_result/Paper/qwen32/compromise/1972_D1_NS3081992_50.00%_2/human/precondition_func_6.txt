No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_7` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the context of reading input, it can be inferred that this function is expected to read a line of input containing two integers and return them as a list of integers. Therefore, the precondition can be described in terms of the expected input. The input consists of a single line with two space-separated integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6.
