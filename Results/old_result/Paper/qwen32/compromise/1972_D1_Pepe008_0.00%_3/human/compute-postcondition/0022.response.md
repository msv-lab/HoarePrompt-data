The code snippet `info = input().split()` reads a new line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `info`. This means the previous value of `info` is overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the accumulated sum of \(x\) for each iteration where \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\)**

In simpler terms, the value of `info` has been updated to a new list of strings from the new input line, while the values of `t`, `T`, `a`, `b`, and `suma` remain unchanged.
