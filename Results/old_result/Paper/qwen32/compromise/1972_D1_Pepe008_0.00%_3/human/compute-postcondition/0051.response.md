To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
- If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `x` is non-negative and `suma` is increased by `x`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `suma`.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on some value, let's call it `i_prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i_next = i_prev + 1`. The loop will continue as long as `i_next <= b`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment in `i`.

State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since `x` and `suma` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone. However, for completeness, note that `x` will be recalculated using the new value of `i`, and `suma` may be updated if `x` is non-negative.

Final State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

If we assume `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, then the start of the next iteration would simply be:

State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`**.
