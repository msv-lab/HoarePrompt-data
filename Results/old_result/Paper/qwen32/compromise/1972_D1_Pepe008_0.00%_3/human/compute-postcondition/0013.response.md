The code snippet adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given the initial state, `suma` was previously calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0\). After incrementing `i` by 1, `x` is recalculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\). The new value of `suma` is the old value of `suma` plus the new value of `x`.

Therefore, the updated `suma` will be the previous `suma` plus the newly calculated `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is greater than 0; `suma` is the previous `suma` plus the newly calculated `x`; `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\); `i` is incremented by 1.**
