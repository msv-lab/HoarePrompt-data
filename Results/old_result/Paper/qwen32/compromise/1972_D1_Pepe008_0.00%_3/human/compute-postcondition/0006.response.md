To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
```

This means the variables `i` and `b` are the ones that can be directly influenced to control the execution of the loop.

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: This variable is initialized to 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `b + 1`. We don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts because its initial value is defined by the `range` function.
- **`b`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be at least 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `b + 1`).

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`
- `suma` is 0

### Adjustments Needed:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, `b` must be at least 1. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `suma`) are not directly related to the execution of the loop based on the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0**
