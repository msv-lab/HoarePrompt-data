The code snippet provided modifies the value of `suma` by adding the current value of `x` to it. The values of `b`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged by this operation.

Given:
- `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.

After executing `suma += x`, the new value of `suma` is its previous value plus `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + x`.**
