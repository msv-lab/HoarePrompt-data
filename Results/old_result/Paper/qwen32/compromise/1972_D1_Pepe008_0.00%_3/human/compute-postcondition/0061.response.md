To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and how it processes each input.

### Loop Analysis
The loop runs `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases provided as input. For each test case, the following steps occur:
1. Read a line of input and split it into two integers, `a` and `b`.
2. Initialize `suma` to 0.
3. Iterate over `i` from 1 to `b`.
   - Calculate `x` using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), add `x` to `suma`.
4. Print `suma - 1`.

### Final Output State
After all `T` iterations, the loop will have processed all test cases. The final state will involve the completion of all iterations, with each test case's result being printed sequentially.

### Output State Description
- `t` will have taken on all values from 0 to `T-1` during the loop's execution.
- `T` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.
- `info`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the values of the last test case processed.
- `suma` will be the accumulated sum for the last test case processed, and it will be printed as `suma - 1`.
- The loop will have printed the results for all `T` test cases.

### Final Output State Format
Since the question asks for the final output state in a specific format, we can summarize the final state as follows:

Output State: **The loop has executed `T` times, printing the result `suma - 1` for each of the `T` test cases. Variables `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` reflect the state after processing the last test case.**

This means that after all iterations, the loop will have completed its task of processing all `T` test cases and printing the respective results.
