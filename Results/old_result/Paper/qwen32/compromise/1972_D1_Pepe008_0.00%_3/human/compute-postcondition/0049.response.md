The code snippet `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` and is non-negative, and `suma` is presumably an accumulator variable, the new value of `suma` will be its previous value plus `x`.

The other variables (`b`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`; `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0; the current value of `x` is non-negative; `suma` is increased by `x`.**
