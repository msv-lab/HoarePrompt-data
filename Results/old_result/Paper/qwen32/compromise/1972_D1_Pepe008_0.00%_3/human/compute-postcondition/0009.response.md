The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to the current value of `suma`. Since `suma` was initially 0, after executing this line, `suma` will be equal to the value of `x`.

The values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and the expression for `x` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1; `suma` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\); `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\)**.
