To determine the output state, we'll evaluate the given Python code snippet with the provided initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is \(t + 1\)
- `T` is greater than 0
- `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is \(i + 1\)

We need to compute the value of `x` using the formula provided. The value of `x` depends on the current values of `a` and `i`.

The formula for `x` is:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

Since the exact values of `a` and `i` are not specified, we will express `x` in terms of `a` and `i`.

After executing the code, the new state will include the computed value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `i` is \(i + 1\), `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\)**

In natural language, this means:
- `t` remains \(t + 1\)
- `T` remains greater than 0
- `info` remains the new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line
- `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` remains an integer value greater than or equal to 1
- `i` remains \(i + 1\)
- `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\)
