Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string from the input and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least one key-value pair. `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current one. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is `m * k + (m - hmp[i])`; otherwise, `ans` remains `m * k`, where `k` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, the new value of `ans` is the old value of `ans` plus `m - hmp[i]`.**
