Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEF'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `m * k + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`, where `k` is the number of characters in `p` not in `hmp`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is the first integer from the input, m is the second integer from the input, a remains unchanged, s is the input string, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in s, t has been decremented by 1, ans is 6 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` remains unchanged, `s` is the same non-empty string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `t` has been incremented by 1 six times, and `ans` is `6 * m` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for all characters `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
