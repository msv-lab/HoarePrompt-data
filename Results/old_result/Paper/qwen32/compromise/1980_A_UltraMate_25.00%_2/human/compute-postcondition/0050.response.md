Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` remains unchanged, `s` is a non-empty input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least one key, `t` has been decremented by 1. If the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is `7 * m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `6 * m`.**
