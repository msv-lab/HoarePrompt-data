Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` remains unchanged, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the non-empty `s`, `t` has been incremented by 1 six times, `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current key. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `6 * m`.**
