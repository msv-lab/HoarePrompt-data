The code snippet sorts the list `balance_info` based on a key that is a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object, and the second element is the negative of the `position` attribute. This means that the list will be sorted primarily by the `balance` in ascending order, and for objects with the same `balance`, it will be sorted by `position` in descending order.

Given the initial state, the variables `s`, `n`, and `balance` remain unchanged. Only `balance_info` is modified by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and the string represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `position` in descending order for objects with the same `balance`; `balance` is 0.**
