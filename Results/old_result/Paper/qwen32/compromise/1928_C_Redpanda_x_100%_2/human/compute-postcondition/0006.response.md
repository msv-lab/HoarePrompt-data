Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary, `rest` is a non-empty collection (e.g., a list or set) returned by `generate(k + 1)`, `prime_to_i` is 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `prime_to_i` has been set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
