The code snippet `yield 1` indicates that the function will produce a generator that yields the value 1. This does not change the value of `k` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The function will pause its execution after yielding the value 1 and can be resumed later.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, and the function yields 1.**
