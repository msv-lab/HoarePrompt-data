The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state. The loop iterates based on the value of `factors[prime] + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used within the loop body. However, the loop will continue to execute as long as the range has not been exhausted.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `factors[prime] + 1` is greater than the current iteration count. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, we only need to ensure that the range is correctly set up for the next iteration.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`**

Since the loop iterates based on `factors[prime] + 1`, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop variable `_`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the range has not been exhausted.

Therefore, the state remains the same for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`**
