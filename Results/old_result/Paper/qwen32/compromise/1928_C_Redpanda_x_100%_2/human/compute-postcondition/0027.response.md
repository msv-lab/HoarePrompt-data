The code snippet `prime_to_i *= prime` updates the value of `prime_to_i` by multiplying it with `prime`. Initially, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`. After the execution, `prime_to_i` becomes `(prime * prime) * prime`, which is `prime ** 3`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is `prime ** 3`, a value equal to `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**
