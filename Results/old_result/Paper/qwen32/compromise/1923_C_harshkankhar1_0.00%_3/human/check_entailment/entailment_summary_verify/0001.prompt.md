You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each test case, it calculates cumulative sums of the list and answers queries about sublists, printing "YES" or "NO" based on specific conditions. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with constraints on the total number of elements and queries across all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires determining if a given subarray `c[l_i : r_i]` of an array `c` can be considered "good." A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length where:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray `c[l_i : r_i]` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
2. No element in `c[l_i : r_i]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

### Code Analysis
Let's break down the code and see if it meets the criteria:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The input is read and parsed.
   - `a` is initialized as the input array `c` with a leading 0 for easier indexing.
   - `b` is initialized as an array of zeros with the same length as `a`.

2. **Building `b`**:
   - For each element in `a` (starting from index 1), `b[i]` is set to `b[i-1] + 1` if `a[i] > 1`, otherwise `b[i] = b[i-1] + 2`.
   - This step is intended to create a `b` array where the sum of `b` is at least the sum of `a` (with a slight increment to ensure `a[i] != b[i]`).

3. **Accumulate Sums**:
   - `a` is transformed into a prefix sum array using `accumulate`.
   - This allows for quick computation of the sum of any subarray `c[l_i : r_i]` using `a[r_i] - a[l_i - 1]`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the sum of the subarray `c[l_i : r_i]` is compared against the sum of the corresponding segment in `b`.
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is used to determine if the subarray is good. If this condition is true, "NO" is printed; otherwise, "YES" is printed.

### Issues
- **Condition for Good Subarray**: The main issue is the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y`. This condition does not correctly check if the subarray can be made "good" according to the problem's rules. Specifically:
  - It does not ensure that all elements in `b` are positive.
  - It does not ensure that `a[i] != b[i]` for all `i` in the subarray.
  - The condition `x == y` is not a valid check for the subarray being good.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly determine if a subarray is good based on the problem's criteria. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
