- The idea behind the solution is to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. The program uses the product of the multipliers and divides it by each multiplier to distribute the bets in a way that satisfies the condition.
  - The normalization step ensures that the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.
