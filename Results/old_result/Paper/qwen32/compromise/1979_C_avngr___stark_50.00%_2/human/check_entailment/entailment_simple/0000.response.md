### Reasoning:

The given Python program attempts to solve the problem by distributing the bets in a specific way. Let's break down the logic and verify if it adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all the multipliers `k_i`. This product represents a common multiple of all the multipliers.

3. **Calculating Individual Bets:**
   - It then calculates individual bets `c_i` as `m / k_i` for each outcome. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the total bet `m` will be multiplied by `k_i` to get back `m * k_i / k_i = m`, which is greater than the total bet `m`.

4. **Finding the GCD:**
   - The program finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the calculated bets `c_i`. This is done using the `func_1` function, which correctly computes the GCD of the list of bets.

5. **Normalizing Bets:**
   - The bets `c_i` are then divided by the GCD to ensure that they are in their simplest form while maintaining the property that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

6. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets is less than `m / hcf`. If the sum of the bets is not less than `m / hcf`, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The approach of calculating the bets as `m / k_i` ensures that for any winning outcome, the return `k_i * (m / k_i) = m` will be greater than the total bet `m`.
  - Normalizing the bets by dividing by the GCD does not change the relative proportions and ensures that the bets are integers.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all `k_i` are the same, the GCD will be `k_i`, and the bets will all be `m / k_i`, which is correct.
  - If the multipliers are different, the bets will be different, but the sum of the bets will still be less than `m / hcf`.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The check `sum(c) >= m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If this condition is not met, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. It handles the edge cases and checks for feasibility correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
