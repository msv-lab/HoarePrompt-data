### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment to ensure correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to distribute bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total sum of bets \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \) is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome \( k_i \times x_i \) for all \( i \).

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k`. This is correct as it is the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers if they were all distinct primes, but in general, it's just the product.

3. **Calculating `c`:**
   - `c` is a list where each element `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`. This essentially computes the LCM of all multipliers except `k[i]`. This step is mathematically sound.

4. **Finding the HCF of `c`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the elements in `c`. This is used to normalize the values to the smallest possible integers.

5. **Normalizing `c`:**
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the HCF of `c` to normalize the values. This step ensures that the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.

6. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized `c` is less than `m / hcf`. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints the normalized `c` values.

#### Correctness Analysis:

- **Conceptual Correctness:**
  - The idea behind the solution is to find a set of bets \( x_i \) such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. The program uses the product of the multipliers and divides it by each multiplier to distribute the bets in a way that satisfies the condition.
  - The normalization step ensures that the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.

- **Implementation Details:**
  - The program correctly calculates the product of the multipliers.
  - It computes the LCM of all multipliers except the current one for each outcome.
  - The HCF of these values is used to normalize the bets, ensuring that they are integers and as small as possible.
  - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all multipliers are the same, the program will return `-1` because the sum of bets cannot be less than the return for any outcome. This is correct.
  - If the multipliers are distinct, the program will find a valid distribution of bets. This is also correct.

#### Annotated Code Review:

The annotations provided do not seem to introduce any errors or misinterpretations. The annotations describe the state of the program accurately, and the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or determine that no such distribution exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
