### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) and then computing \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

The key points to consider are:
1. Each pair of friends has a certain initial friendship value.
2. Each excursion, a pair is chosen uniformly at random.
3. If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
4. The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen over \(k\) excursions needs to be computed.

The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1` which computes the result for a single test case.
- `func_2` which handles multiple test cases.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input:** `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (list of friend pairs with their initial friendship values).
- **Logic:** 
  - For each pair of friends, the friendship value is incremented by 1 for each subsequent excursion after the first time they are chosen.
  - The total contribution of a pair to the sum over `k` excursions is given by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).
  - This contribution is multiplied by the initial friendship value `f`.
  - The results are accumulated for all pairs and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input:** Handles multiple test cases.
- **Logic:** 
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
  - Calls `func_1` to compute the result for the test case and prints the result.

#### Correctness:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct for computing the expected value for a single test case. It correctly calculates the contribution of each pair to the sum over `k` excursions and accumulates these contributions.
- The logic in `func_2` is correct for handling multiple test cases, reading inputs, and printing results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
