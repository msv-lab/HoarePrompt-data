Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of lists `friendships`. The parameter `n` represents the number of children, `m` represents the number of pairs of friends, and `k` represents the number of excursions. The `friendships` list contains `m` sublists, each with three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing the indices of a pair of friends and their friendship value. The function returns the total sum of the friendship values for the selected pairs of friends who go on excursions, ensuring that each child participates in at most one excursion.**
