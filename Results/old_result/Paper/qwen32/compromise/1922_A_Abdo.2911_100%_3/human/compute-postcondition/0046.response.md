The provided code snippet reassigns the variable `n` with a new integer value from user input, effectively overwriting its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `possible` is `False`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` has been updated to whatever integer the user inputs, while all other variables retain their initial values.
