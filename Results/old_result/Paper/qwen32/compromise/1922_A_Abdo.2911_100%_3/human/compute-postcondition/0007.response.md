For the given task, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n):`, so we need to focus on the variables `i` and `n`.

Given:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `possible` is False.

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, as `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Since `n` is provided by the user and is guaranteed to be between 1 and 20, the loop will execute as long as `n` is within this range.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Thus, no adjustments are needed for `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `possible` to ensure the loop executes. The only requirement is that `n` is at least 1, which is already given in the problem statement.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `possible` is False**
