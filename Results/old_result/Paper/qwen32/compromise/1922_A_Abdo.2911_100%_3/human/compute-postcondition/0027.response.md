Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `possible` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
