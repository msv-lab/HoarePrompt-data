The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 (since the loop condition is `i in range(n)`).

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `possible`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `i` is 3**.
