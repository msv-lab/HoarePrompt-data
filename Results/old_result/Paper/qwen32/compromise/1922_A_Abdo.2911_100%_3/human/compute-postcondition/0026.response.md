The code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1, `possible` is True**.
