The code snippet provided sets the variable `possible` to `False`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `possible` is False.**
