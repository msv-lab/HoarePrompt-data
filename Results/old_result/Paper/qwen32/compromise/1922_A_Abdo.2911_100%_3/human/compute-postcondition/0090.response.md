The provided code snippet only contains the line `n = int(input())`, which means it will read an integer value from the user input and assign it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state already specifies that `n` is an integer value provided by user input, executing this line will not change the value of `n` as it is already set to a user-provided value. Therefore, the values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, and `possible` is either `True` or `False` based on the initial value of `possible`.**
