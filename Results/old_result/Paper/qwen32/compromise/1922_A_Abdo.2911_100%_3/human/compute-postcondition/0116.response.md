Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True`. `i` is 2.**
