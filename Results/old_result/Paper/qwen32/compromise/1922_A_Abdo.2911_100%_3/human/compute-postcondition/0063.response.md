Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input. Additionally, the `i`th character of `a` is not equal to the `i`th character of `b`. If the `i`th character of `c` is equal to either the `i`th character of `a` or the `i`th character of `b`, the state remains as described. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
