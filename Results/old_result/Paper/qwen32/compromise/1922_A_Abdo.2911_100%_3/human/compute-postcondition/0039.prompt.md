Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `possible` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each. For the current index `i`, if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken out of if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` remains False if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged and no break occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged and the loop continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
