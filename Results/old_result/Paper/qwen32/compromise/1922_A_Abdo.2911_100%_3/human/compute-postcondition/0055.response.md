Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `possible` is `True`. Additionally, at the current index `i`, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but the loop or if statement is exited.
