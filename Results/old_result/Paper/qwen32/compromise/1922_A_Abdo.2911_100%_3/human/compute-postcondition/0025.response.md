The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop structure (like `for` or `while`) that would be affected by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the program state in this context.

The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged by the `continue` statement. The only change is that `i` is incremented by 1 before the `continue` statement, but since the `continue` statement does not alter the flow in this context, the increment of `i` is the only change.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1**.
