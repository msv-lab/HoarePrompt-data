### Reasoning:

The function `func_1` processes each test case as described in the problem statement. For each test case, it iterates through each character position `i` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine if a valid template `t` can be constructed such that `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not match `t`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **If `a[i] == b[i]`:**
   - The character at position `i` in the template `t` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]` since they are the same). 
   - Therefore, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`) to not match the template.
   - If `c[i] != a[i]`, it means `c` does not match the template at position `i`, and `a` and `b` do match the template at position `i`. This sets `possible` to `True`, and the loop breaks.

2. **If `a[i] != b[i]`:**
   - The character at position `i` in the template `t` can be either the uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
   - Therefore, `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` to not match the template.
   - If `c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]`, it means `c` matches the template at position `i`. The loop continues to the next position.
   - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it means `c` does not match the template at position `i`, and `a` and `b` do match the template at position `i`. This sets `possible` to `True`, and the loop breaks.

3. **If `possible` remains `False` after the loop:**
   - It means there is no position `i` where `c` does not match the template while `a` and `b` do match it. Therefore, the function prints "NO" for that test case.

4. **If `possible` is set to `True` during any iteration:**
   - It means there is at least one position `i` where `c` does not match the template while `a` and `b` do match it. Therefore, the function prints "YES" for that test case.

The logic correctly implements the conditions described in the problem statement. The function checks all necessary conditions and prints the correct result based on the provided test cases.
