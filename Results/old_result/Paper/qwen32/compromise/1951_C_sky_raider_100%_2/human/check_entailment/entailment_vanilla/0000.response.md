Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to buy `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.
- Our goal is to minimize the total cost of buying `k` tickets.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution sorts the list of ticket prices and iterates through them in ascending order. For each day, it buys as many tickets as possible (up to `m` tickets or until `k` tickets are bought), calculates the cost considering the price increase, and updates the remaining number of tickets and the price increase.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. **Reading Input:** It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices `l`.
2. **Sorting Prices:** It sorts the list of prices in ascending order.
3. **Buying Tickets:** It iterates through the sorted list of prices:
   - For each day, it determines the number of tickets to buy (`s`), which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining number of tickets `k`.
   - It calculates the cost of these tickets, taking into account the price increase (`t`).
   - It updates the total cost (`c`), the price increase (`t`), and the remaining number of tickets (`k`).
4. **Output:** It prints the total cost for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- **Sorting Prices:** Sorting the prices ensures that we always buy the cheapest available tickets first, which minimizes the total cost.
- **Buying Tickets:** By buying up to `m` tickets each day, it respects the constraint on the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day.
- **Price Increase:** The price increase is correctly applied by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day to the price increase for subsequent days.
- **Termination:** The loop terminates when all `k` tickets are bought.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. Therefore, the solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
