Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets `k` to be purchased is less than the maximum number of tickets `m` that can be purchased in a single day. Specifically, the program always attempts to purchase up to `m` tickets each day, which may lead to unnecessary purchases and increased costs.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this issue:

### Example Input:
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

### Expected Output:
```
10
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
- On the first day, purchase 0 tickets. Prices remain `[8, 6, 4, 2]`.
- On the second day, purchase 0 tickets. Prices remain `[6, 4, 2]`.
- On the third day, purchase 1 ticket for 4 units. Prices increase to `[7, 5, 3]`.
- On the fourth day, purchase 2 tickets for 6 units. Prices increase to `[9, 7, 5]`.

Total cost: `0 + 0 + 4 + 6 = 10`.

### Actual Output of Provided Program:
The provided program will purchase up to 2 tickets each day, leading to a higher cost.

### Actual Execution of Provided Program:
- On the first day, purchase 2 tickets for 16 units. Prices increase to `[10, 8, 6]`.
- On the second day, purchase 2 tickets for 16 units. Prices increase to `[12, 10, 8]`.
- On the third day, purchase 2 tickets for 20 units. Prices increase to `[14, 12, 10]`.
- On the fourth day, purchase 0 tickets. Prices remain `[14, 12, 10]`.

Total cost: `16 + 16 + 20 + 0 = 52`.

This demonstrates that the provided program does not always yield the minimum cost for purchasing the required number of tickets. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
