The code snippet `c += s * (l[i] + t)` modifies the value of `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `k` is `k - s`.
- `t` is `s`.
- `c` is `s * l[i]`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.

Since `t` is `s` and `i` is `0`, the expression `s * (l[i] + t)` becomes `s * (l[0] + s)`. 

Therefore, the new value of `c` is `c + s * (l[0] + s)`, which is `s * l[0] + s * (l[0] + s)` simplifying to `s * l[0] + s * l[0] + s * s` or `2 * s * l[0] + s * s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is `k - s`, `t` is `s`, `c` is `2 * s * l[0] + s * s`, `i` is `0`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
