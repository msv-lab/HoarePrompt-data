The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` now being `k - s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[i]`.**
