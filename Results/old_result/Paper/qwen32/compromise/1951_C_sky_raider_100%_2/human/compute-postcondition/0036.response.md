The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (which was `i` at the start of the last iteration), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the start of the last iteration as `i_old`. After the last iteration, `i` became `i_old + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_old + 2`.

Since `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, and `i` is now `i_old + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i_old + 2`.

However, the problem statement does not provide the exact value of `i_old`, but we know that at the start of this iteration, `i` should be the value it took at the end of the previous iteration, which is `i_old + 1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i_old + 2`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the start of the next iteration as `i` being incremented by 1 from its end value, making it `i + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its end value, so `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, which is `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `s * l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k)`**
