The code snippet `c += s * (l[i] + t)` modifies the value of `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to it. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `l`, and `t` are used in the calculation, but only `c` is updated.

- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.
- `s` remains `min(m, k)`.
- `l` and `t` are used in the calculation but their values do not change.

The new value of `c` is the old value of `c` plus `s * (l[i] + t)`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + t)`**.
