`t` is updated to `t + s`. Given that `t` was initially `s`, `t` now becomes `2 * s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is `k - s`, `t` is `2 * s`, `c` is `2 * s * l[0] + s * s`, `i` is `0`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
