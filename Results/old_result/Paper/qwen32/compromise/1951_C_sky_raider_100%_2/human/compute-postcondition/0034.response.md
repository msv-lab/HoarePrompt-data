The code snippet `t += s` increments the value of `t` by the value of `s`. Given that `t` was initially 0 and `s` is `min(m, k)`, after the operation, `t` will be equal to `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `s * l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m`, `k`, and `l` are the values read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`**.
