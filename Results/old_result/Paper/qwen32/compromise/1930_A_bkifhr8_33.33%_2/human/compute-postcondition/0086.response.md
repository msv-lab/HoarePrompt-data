The code snippet removes the element at index `1 * 2` (which is index 2) from the list `lst`. This operation affects only the list `lst` by removing its third element (since list indices start at 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed and the third element removed, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))]**.

In simple terms, the third element of `lst` has been removed, and all other variables remain unchanged.
