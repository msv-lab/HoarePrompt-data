The code snippet provided appends the value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. Therefore, the list `ans_f` will now contain two elements: the initial `0` and the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is either an empty list or a list of two elements, `ans` is the sum of the minimums of all pairs of elements processed.**
