Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))], `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is increased by the smaller of the first two integers in the list `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
