Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values except for the fact that we have exited the loop or if statement.
