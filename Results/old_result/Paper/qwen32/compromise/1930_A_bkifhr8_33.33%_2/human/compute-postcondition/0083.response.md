The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50
- `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7
- `l` is a string input by the user
- `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces
- If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has its first and third elements removed, and `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))], where `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the modified `lst` converted to integers.
- If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))], where `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n * 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 2.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans` + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))]**
