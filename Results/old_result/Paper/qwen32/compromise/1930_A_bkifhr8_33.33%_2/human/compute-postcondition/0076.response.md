To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`].
- `l` is a string input by the user.
- `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has its first and third elements removed, and `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the modified `lst` converted to integers. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(n * 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate `n * 2` times.
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

### State at the start of the next iteration:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

### State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`], `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is the list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has its first and third elements removed, and `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of the modified `lst` converted to integers. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.**
