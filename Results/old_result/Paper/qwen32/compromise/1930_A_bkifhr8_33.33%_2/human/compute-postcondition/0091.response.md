Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the elements [0, `ans`, `ans`], `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is either empty or contains two elements.**

Explanation: The variable `ans_f` originally contained the elements `[0, ans]`. After the code `ans_f.append(ans)` is executed, `ans_f` now contains the elements `[0, `ans`, `ans`]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
