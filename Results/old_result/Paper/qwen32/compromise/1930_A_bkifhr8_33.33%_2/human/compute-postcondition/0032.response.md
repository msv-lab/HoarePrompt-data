The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list containing the single element 0, `l` is a string representing the line of input from the user, and `lst` is a list with fewer than 2 elements, `ans` is 0**
