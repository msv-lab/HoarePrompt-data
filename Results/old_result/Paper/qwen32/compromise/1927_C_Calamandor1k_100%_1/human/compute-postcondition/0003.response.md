Output State: **The program returns `results`, which is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `cases` based on the specified conditions.**

This means that for each tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in the list `cases`, the program evaluates certain conditions (not specified in the provided snippet) and appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list. The final output is the `results` list containing these decisions for all test cases.
