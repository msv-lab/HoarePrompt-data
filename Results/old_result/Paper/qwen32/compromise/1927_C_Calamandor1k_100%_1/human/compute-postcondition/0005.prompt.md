You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in the list 'cases' is a tuple containing three elements: (n, m, k) where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m). The next two elements in each test case are lists 'a' and 'b' of lengths n and m respectively, where each element in 'a' and 'b' is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        
        unique_b = set(b)
        
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        results.append('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in the list 'cases' is a tuple containing three elements: (n, m, k) where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m); the next two elements in each test case are lists 'a' and 'b' of lengths n and m respectively, where each element in 'a' and 'b' is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in 'cases' based on the conditions specified in the loop.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `cases` based on the specified conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cases` containing tuples. Each tuple consists of integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, the function returns 'YES' if certain conditions are met based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The results for all test cases are returned as a list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `results`, which is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `cases` based on the specified conditions.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
