### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements and the original assessment.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Target Water Level:** The target amount of water each container should have is `sum(a_i) / n`, which is guaranteed to be an integer since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
2. **Operation Constraint:** Water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to one with a larger index.
3. **Objective:** Determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operation.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate Target Water Level:** Compute the target `target = sum(a_i) / n`.
2. **Check Cumulative Sum:** As we iterate through the containers, maintain a cumulative sum of water poured and check if it matches the expected cumulative sum for the target water level up to that point.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
The provided program attempts to determine if it's possible to make the water levels equal but does so incorrectly:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `last`:** The variable `last` is set to the last element of the list (`nums[-1]`). This value is not used correctly to check the cumulative sum condition.
2. **Incorrect Cumulative Sum Logic:** The logic `curr += i - last` does not correctly check if the cumulative sum can be evenly distributed up to the current container. It simply sums up the differences between each element and the last element, which is not relevant to the problem.
3. **No Target Calculation:** The program does not calculate the target amount of water each container should have.
4. **Incorrect Condition for "YES":** The condition `if curr == 0` does not correctly determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program but do not address the core logic issues. The program iterates through the list and updates `curr` based on the incorrect logic `curr += i - last`, which does not help in determining if the water can be evenly distributed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers based on the given constraints and operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
