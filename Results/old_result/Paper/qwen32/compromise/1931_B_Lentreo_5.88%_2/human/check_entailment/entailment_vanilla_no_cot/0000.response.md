Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program is flawed and does not accurately reflect the requirements of the problem.

The key to solving this problem is to check if, starting from the leftmost container, you can pour water from any container to any container to the right such that all containers end up with the same amount of water. This is possible if and only if, at every step, the cumulative sum of the differences between the current container's water level and the target water level (which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers) is non-negative.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        curr = 0
        possible = True
        for i in nums:
            curr += i - target
            if curr < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the target amount of water each container should have (`target = sum(nums) // n`). We then iterate through the containers, maintaining a running total of the difference between the current amount of water and the target (`curr += i - target`). If at any point this running total becomes negative, it means we cannot pour enough water from the previous containers to the current one to meet the target, and we print "NO". If we can go through all containers without the running total going negative, we print "YES".
