Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed and does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

The program calculates the sum of differences between each non-zero element and the last element, and checks if this sum equals zero. However, this approach does not consider the proper redistribution of water according to the problem's constraints.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can distribute the water such that all containers have the same amount. Given that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the target amount of water for each container is the total sum divided by the number of containers. The task is to determine if we can redistribute the water using the allowed operation (pouring water from a container to a container with a higher index).

A correct approach would be to check if, at each step, we can pour water from containers with more water to containers with less water, ensuring that the operation constraints (i < j) are respected.

Since the provided program does not implement this logic, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
