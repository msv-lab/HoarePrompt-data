The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not affect the state of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, or `curr`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since the loop runs `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to allow the loop to execute again if `t` is greater than 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the input list of integers, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. If `curr` is 0, then no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**
