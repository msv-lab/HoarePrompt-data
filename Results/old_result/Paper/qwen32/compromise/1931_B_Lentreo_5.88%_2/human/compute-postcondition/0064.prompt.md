Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    last = nums[-1]
    curr = 0
    for i in nums:
        if i != 0:
            curr += i - last
    if curr == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the number of integers in `nums`, `nums` is the list of integers read from the input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the accumulated sum of differences `i - last` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the input list of integers, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. If `curr` is 0, then no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `last` is `nums[-1]`, and `curr` is the sum of all `i - last` for each `i` in `nums` that is not 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. If `curr` is 0, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
