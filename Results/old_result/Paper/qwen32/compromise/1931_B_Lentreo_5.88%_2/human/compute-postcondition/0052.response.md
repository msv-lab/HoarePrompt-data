The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element of `nums` (i.e., `last`). For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `nums` to iterate over.

Let's denote the next element in `nums` as `next_element`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `next_element`.

Here's the adjusted state:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is `nums[-1]`, and `curr` is `i - last` if `i` is not 0. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0, and `i` is `next_element`**.

Since `curr` is dependent on `i` and `last`, and `last` is the previous `i`, we need to adjust `curr` to reflect the new value of `i` (which is `next_element`). However, since `curr` is not part of the loop head, we only adjust `i` in the state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is `nums[-1]`, `i` is `next_element`**. 

Note: `curr` will be recalculated within the loop body using the new value of `i` and `last`.
