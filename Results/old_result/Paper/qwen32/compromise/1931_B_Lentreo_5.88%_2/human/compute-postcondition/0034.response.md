The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the for loop, `i` will take the next value from the `nums` list in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the next element in `nums` after `last`. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `nums` must have at least one more element after the current `i`. The state of `i` will be updated to the next element in `nums`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `last` is the current `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums` after `last`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.**
