The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any of these variables.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is the input list of integers.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. Additionally, `curr` is not equal to 0.

Since the `print` statement is `print('NO')`, the output will simply be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
