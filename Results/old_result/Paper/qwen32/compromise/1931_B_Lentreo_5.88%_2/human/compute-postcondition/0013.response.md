The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If there are more elements in `nums`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current element from `nums`, and `last` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration.

To execute one more time, `nums` must still have more elements to iterate over. The variable `i` will take the next value from `nums`. The variable `last` will be updated to the current value of `i` from the previous iteration, which is the value that `i` had before it was updated in the loop body.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` are provided. To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to update `i` to the next element in `nums` and ensure that `nums` still has elements left.

Let's assume the current index of `i` in `nums` is `index`. After the current iteration, `index` would have been incremented. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `nums[index]` where `index` is the position right after the current `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `last` is the current `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums`**

Since we need to adjust only the objects in the loop head, we update `i` to the next element in `nums`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `last` is the current `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is `nums[index + 1]` where `index` is the position of the current `i` in `nums`**

However, since we don't have the exact `index` in the provided state, we can just say `i` is the next element in `nums`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `last` is the current `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums`**
