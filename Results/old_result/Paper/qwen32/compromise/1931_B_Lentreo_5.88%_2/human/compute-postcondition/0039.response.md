The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr`), but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is the input list of integers.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- `curr` is the sum of \((i - \text{last})\) for all `i` in `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. The current value of `curr` is 0.

Despite the detailed initial state, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It will execute and print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr`.

Output: **YES**
