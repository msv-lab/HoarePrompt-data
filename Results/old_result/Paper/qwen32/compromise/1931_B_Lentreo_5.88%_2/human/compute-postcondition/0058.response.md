To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes the `nums` list. The loop iterates over each element `i` in `nums`, and if `i` is not 0, it updates `curr` by adding the difference between `i` and `last` (the previous element in `nums`). The variable `last` is updated to the current element `i` after each iteration.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's effect:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (remains unchanged).
   - `n` is an input integer (remains unchanged).
   - `nums` is a list of integers (remains unchanged).
   - `last` is `nums[-1]` (will be updated during iterations).
   - `curr` is 0 (will be updated during iterations).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `i` in `nums`:
     - If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.
     - `last` is updated to `i` at the end of each iteration.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `nums` remains unchanged.
   - `last` will be the last element of `nums` after the loop completes.
   - `curr` will be the sum of all differences `i - last` for each `i` in `nums` that is not 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list.

Let's formalize this:

- **Output State**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `last` is `nums[-1]`, and `curr` is the sum of all `i - last` for each `i` in `nums` that is not 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list.

In natural language: After all iterations, `t` and `n` remain the same, `nums` remains unchanged, `last` becomes the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the sum of differences between each non-zero element and its previous element in the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `last` is `nums[-1]`, and `curr` is the sum of all `i - last` for each `i` in `nums` that is not 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list.**
