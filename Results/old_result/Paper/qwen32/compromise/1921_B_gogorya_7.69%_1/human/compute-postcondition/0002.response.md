`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer**.
