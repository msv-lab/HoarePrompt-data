The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `res`, and `hd` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`, `hd` is decreased by 1**.
