The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables or affect the conditions of the loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `i`, and `hd` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `i` is incremented by 1; `hd` is decreased by 1.**
