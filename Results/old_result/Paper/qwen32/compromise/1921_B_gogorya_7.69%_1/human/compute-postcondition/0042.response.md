The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable or the flow of the program in this context. Therefore, none of the variables will be changed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are new input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` and `hd` is greater than 0; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `i` is 0**.
