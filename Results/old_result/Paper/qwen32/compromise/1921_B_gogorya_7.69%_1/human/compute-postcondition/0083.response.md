The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `t + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same as long as it is greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is greater than `t + 1`, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, then `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. Otherwise, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1.**
