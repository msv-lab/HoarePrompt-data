The code snippet provided decrements the value of `hd` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the decrement in `hd` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `i` is incremented by 1; `hd` is decreased by 1.**
