To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description and the annotated execution states.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice moves down, down-right, or down-left.
   - Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left.
   - A player wins if they land on the opponent's chip.
   - The game ends in a draw if a player cannot make a move.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they make moves to win if possible or avoid losing if they can.

3. **Winning Conditions**:
   - Alice wins if she can move to Bob's position before Bob can move to her position.
   - Bob wins if he can move to Alice's position before Alice can move to his position.
   - If neither can force a win, the game ends in a draw.

### Program Logic Analysis:
The program logic provided in the function `func` appears to be based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob's chips and the number of moves they can make. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - If Alice's row position `xa` is greater than Bob's row position `xb`, the program immediately prints "Draw". This is because Alice has already passed Bob vertically, and Bob cannot catch up since Alice can only move down.

2. **Calculating the Distance**:
   - The program calculates the half-distance `x` between Alice and Bob's row positions: `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - If the distance is odd, it adjusts the range of columns Bob can reach in `x + 1` moves.
   - If the distance is even, it adjusts the range of columns Alice can reach in `x` moves.

3. **Column Range Calculation**:
   - For an odd distance, it calculates the leftmost (`l`) and rightmost (`r`) columns Bob can reach.
   - For an even distance, it calculates the leftmost (`l`) and rightmost (`r`) columns Alice can reach.

4. **Winning Condition Check**:
   - For an odd distance, it checks if Alice can reach any column within the range `[l, r]` in `x + 1` moves. If yes, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.
   - For an even distance, it checks if Bob can reach any column within the range `[l, r]` in `x` moves. If yes, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program logic seems to correctly implement the game rules and optimal play scenarios. It considers both players' movements and checks if either can force a win based on their positions.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to determine the winner or a draw based on the game rules and optimal play.

**Correctness: True**
