You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of dimensions `h` by `w` and two distinct points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` on this grid. For each test case, it prints 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the relative positions of these points. The input values remain unchanged after processing each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues:

1. **Condition `xa > xb`:**
   - The program prints "Draw" if `xa > xb`. This is incorrect because the relative positions of Alice and Bob vertically do not solely determine the outcome. Alice can still win if she can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach hers, regardless of whether `xa > xb` or `xa < xb`.

2. **Handling of Moves:**
   - The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` and uses it to determine the range of columns within which Alice or Bob can move. However, this approach does not fully account for the optimal moves and possible captures.
   - The conditions for printing "Alice" and "Bob" are based on the calculated range, but they do not consider all possible scenarios where one player might be able to force a win. For example, if Alice is directly below Bob and can move diagonally to capture him, the current logic might not correctly identify this.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when Alice and Bob are in positions where they can directly capture each other in the next move, or when they are in positions where one player can force a draw by blocking the other player's moves.

To correctly determine the outcome of the game, a more comprehensive analysis of the positions and possible moves is required. Here is a more detailed approach:

- If Alice is directly below Bob and can move diagonally to capture him, Alice wins.
- If Bob is directly above Alice and can move diagonally to capture her, Bob wins.
- If neither player can capture the other in the next move, and one player is blocked from making any further moves, the game is a draw.
- Otherwise, the player who can force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a move wins.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios, making it incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
