You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: The output state consists of a series of strings printed for each test case, indicating either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the given conditions. The values of h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb remain unchanged from the initial state for each test case, and the number of test cases t also remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of dimensions `h` by `w` and two distinct points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` on this grid. For each test case, it prints 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the relative positions of these points. The input values remain unchanged after processing each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, moving on a grid. Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right, while Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right. The game ends when one player lands on the same cell as the other, or when a player cannot make a move (Alice in the last row, Bob in the first row).

### Strategy
To determine the winner, we need to consider the initial positions of the players and the possible moves they can make. The key points are:
1. If Alice is initially in a row above Bob, she can potentially move down to Bob's row and capture him if he doesn't move away.
2. If Alice is initially in the same row as Bob, the game can end in a draw if neither can move to the other's position.
3. If Alice is initially in a row below Bob, Bob can move up and potentially capture Alice if she doesn't move away.

### Code Analysis
The code provided attempts to determine the winner based on the initial positions of Alice and Bob. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the dimensions of the board `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice `(xa, ya)` and Bob `(xb, yb)` are read.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw". This suggests that if Alice starts in a row below Bob, the game ends in a draw. However, this is incorrect because Alice can still move up to Bob's row and capture him.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The variable `x` is calculated as half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob (`abs(xa - xb) // 2`).
   - If the vertical distance is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), the code calculates the leftmost and rightmost columns Bob can reach (`l` and `r`) within `x` moves from his current column. It then checks if Alice can move to the same column range within `x + 1` moves. If yes, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, "Draw".
   - If the vertical distance is even, the code calculates the leftmost and rightmost columns Alice can reach (`l` and `r`) within `x` moves from her current column. It then checks if Bob can move to the same column range within `x` moves. If yes, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, "Draw".

### Correctness Analysis
The code does not correctly handle all scenarios. Specifically:
- The initial check `if xa > xb` is incorrect. Alice can still move up to Bob's row and capture him even if she starts in a row below him.
- The logic for calculating the reachable column ranges and determining the winner is flawed. It does not correctly account for all possible moves and scenarios.

### Conclusion
Given the incorrect handling of certain scenarios and the flawed logic, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
