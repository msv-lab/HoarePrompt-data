Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, and for each test case, `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are completed, `num_tests` will be zero, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `start_year` will be the least common multiple of the integers provided in the `nums` list for that test case.
