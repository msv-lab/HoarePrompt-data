The `while` loop condition in this case is `num_tests > 0`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` should be adjusted such that it remains greater than 0. Since `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, we can infer that its previous value must have been at least 2. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` should be set to 1 (which is one less than 2 and still greater than 0).

No other variables in the loop head (`start_year`, `n`, `nums`) need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`start_year` is LCM(nums), `num_tests` must be 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input**
