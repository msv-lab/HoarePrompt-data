The code snippet `num_tests -= 1` decreases the value of `num_tests` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `num_tests` must be 1, after the operation, `num_tests` will be 0. Other variables such as `start_year`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start_year` is LCM(nums), `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input**.
