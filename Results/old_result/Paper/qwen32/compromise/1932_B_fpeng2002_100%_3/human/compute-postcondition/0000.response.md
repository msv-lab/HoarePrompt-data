The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, there is an integer `n` between 1 and 100, and a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000. The execution of the code only affects the variable `num_tests` by assigning it the input value, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `num_tests` is an input integer.**
