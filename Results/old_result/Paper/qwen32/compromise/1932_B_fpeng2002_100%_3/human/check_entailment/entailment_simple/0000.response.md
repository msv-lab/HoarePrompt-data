### Reasoning:
The task requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign must occur sequentially, with each subsequent sign occurring after the previous one. The program provided iterates through the list of periodicities for each sign, calculating the year in which each sign occurs, starting from the year following the previous sign's occurrence.

The logic in the program is correct because it calculates the next occurrence of each sign by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the year of the previous sign's occurrence. This is achieved by the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`. This ensures that the signs occur in the correct sequential order.

The program processes each test case independently by resetting the `start_year` to 0 at the beginning of each test case and then iterating through the list of periodicities to compute the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.
