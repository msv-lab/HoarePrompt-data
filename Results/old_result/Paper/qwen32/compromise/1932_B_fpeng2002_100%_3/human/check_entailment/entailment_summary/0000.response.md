Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, considering that signs must occur sequentially with their respective periodicities. The program iterates through each sign's periodicity and calculates the next occurrence year based on the previous sign's occurrence year. 

The core logic of the program is correct. It starts with `start_year` set to 0 and iteratively calculates the next occurrence year for each sign. For each sign's periodicity `a_i`, it computes the next occurrence year as `(start_year // a_i + 1) * a_i`. This formula ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is the smallest multiple of `a_i` that is strictly greater than `start_year`, which aligns with the problem's requirement for sequential occurrences.

The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement and outputs the correct year for each test case.

Execution Summary states that the function calculates and prints the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of integers. However, the problem does not require the LCM of all the periodicities. Instead, it requires finding the year of the sequential occurrence of each sign based on its periodicity. The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the year of the n-th sign's occurrence, not the LCM of all periodicities.

Therefore, given the problem's requirements and the program's behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
