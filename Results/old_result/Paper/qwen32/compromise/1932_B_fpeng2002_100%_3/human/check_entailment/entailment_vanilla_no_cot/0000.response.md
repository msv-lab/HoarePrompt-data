To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign occurs, considering that each sign must occur sequentially after the previous one. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are read.

2. **Calculation of the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign (from the first to the n-th), the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign as follows:
     - `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
     - This formula effectively finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Analysis:
- The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`. This ensures that the tribe waits until the next occurrence of the i-th sign strictly after the (i-1)-th sign has occurred.
- This logic correctly implements the required sequential waiting for each sign.

### Testing with Example Input:
Let's test the program with the provided example input to ensure it produces the correct output.

#### Example Input:
```
4

6
3 2 4 5 9 18

5
1 2 3 4 5

5
1 1 1 1 1

6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Expected Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

The program should correctly produce the expected output for these test cases, as it follows the correct logic to determine the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the example input-output pair.
