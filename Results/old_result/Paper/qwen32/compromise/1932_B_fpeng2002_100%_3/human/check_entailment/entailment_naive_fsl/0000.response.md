Correctness: **True**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur according to the problem description. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the starting point for tracking the occurrence of each sign.

2. **Iterating through the signs**: For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year by:
   - Dividing `start_year` by the periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to get the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly after `start_year`.
   - Multiplying the result by `nums[x]` to get the exact year the sign will occur.

3. **Updating `start_year`**: After calculating the occurrence year for each sign, `start_year` is updated to this year, and the process moves to the next sign.

4. **Output**: After processing all signs, the final value of `start_year` is printed, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the signs to occur sequentially, with each subsequent sign starting its countdown from the year immediately after the previous sign's occurrence.

The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that the program fails to handle according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
