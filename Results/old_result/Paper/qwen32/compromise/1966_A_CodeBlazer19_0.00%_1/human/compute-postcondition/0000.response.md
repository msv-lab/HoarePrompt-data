The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer provided by the user, but it will still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each i from 1 to n.**
