The code snippet assigns a set containing the value of `x` to the variable `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are determined by the function `func_3()`, and they remain unchanged by this assignment. The variable `ans` is now a set containing the single element `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`.**
