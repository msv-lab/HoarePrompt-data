The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_1().split()` to `r` and `c`. This means `r` will be the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` and `c` will be the second part. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', and only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', and only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`**.
