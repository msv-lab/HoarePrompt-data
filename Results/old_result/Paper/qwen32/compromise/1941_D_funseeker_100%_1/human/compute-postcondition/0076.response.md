Let's break down the given problem step by step to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a set containing all possible values that can be reached by iteratively applying the operations defined by `r` and `c` for `m` times starting from `x`.
- If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` also includes the value `n`.
- If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` does not include `n`.

### Code to be executed:
```python
print(len(ans))
```

### Analysis:
The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of unique elements in the set `ans`.

- `ans` is a set, which means it contains unique values.
- The set `ans` is populated based on the operations defined by `r` and `c` applied iteratively `m` times starting from `x`.
- The presence of `0` in `ans` affects whether `n` is included in `ans` or not.
- The length of `ans` (`len(ans)`) is the total number of unique values in this set, which includes all reachable values from `x` using the operations `r` and `c` for `m` times, and possibly `n` if `0` is one of those reachable values.

### Output:
The output will be the number of unique values in the set `ans`.

Since the exact values of `r`, `c`, `m`, `x`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of unique values in the set `ans`.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of unique values in the set `ans`)**
