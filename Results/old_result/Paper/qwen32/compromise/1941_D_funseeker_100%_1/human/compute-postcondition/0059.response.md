The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which iterates over the elements in the set `ans`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `q` to the next element in `ans`.

Given:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
- `m` is an integer greater than 0.
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `ans` is a set containing at least one element.
- `r` is an integer.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` was the last element that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be the next element in `ans`. Since sets are unordered, we don't know the specific order of elements, but we can denote the next element as the next one in some arbitrary order.

Let's denote the next element in `ans` as `next_q`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `q` is the next element in `ans` (let's denote it as `next_q`).**
