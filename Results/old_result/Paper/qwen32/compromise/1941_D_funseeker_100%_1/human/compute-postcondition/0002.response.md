The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`. The loop will execute based on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other variables `n`, `x`, and `ans` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 0. The initial states of `n`, `x`, and `ans` are already within the given constraints and do not need to be modified for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`**
