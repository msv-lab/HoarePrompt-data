The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. Given that `q` is the next element in `ans` (denoted as `next_q`), the new element in `temp` is `(next_q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` now contains `(next_q + r) % n` as an additional element.**
