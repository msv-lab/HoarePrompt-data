Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the values `x` and `y`, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1' or '?', the set `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, the set `temp` contains only the value `(q + r) % n`.**
