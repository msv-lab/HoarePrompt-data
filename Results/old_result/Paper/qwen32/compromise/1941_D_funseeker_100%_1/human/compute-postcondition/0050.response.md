The code snippet `r = int(r)` converts the variable `r` from a string to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `temp`, `c`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', and only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', and only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`**.
