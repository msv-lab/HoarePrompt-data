The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `q`, we can only express the new element in terms of `q`, `r`, and `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer (converted from the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`), `c` is '0' or '?', and `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`.**
