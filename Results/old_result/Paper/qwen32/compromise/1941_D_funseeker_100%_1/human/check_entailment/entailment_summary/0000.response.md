### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - **Execution Summary**: The function correctly reads a line and returns it after stripping whitespace.
   - **Functionality**: Matches the description and is correctly implemented.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - **Execution Summary**: Calls `func_1` to read a line and then converts that line to an integer.
   - **Functionality**: Matches the description and is correctly implemented.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Reads a line of integers from standard input and returns them as a list.
   - **Execution Summary**: Calls `func_1` to read a line, splits the line by spaces, converts each split element to an integer, and returns the resulting list.
   - **Functionality**: Matches the description and is correctly implemented.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Simulates the ball-throwing game and determines the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.
   - **Execution Summary**:
     - Reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
     - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
     - For each throw, reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
     - Depending on the direction `c`, updates the set `ans` with the new possible positions of the ball:
       - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position obtained by moving `r` steps clockwise.
       - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position obtained by moving `r` steps counterclockwise.
     - Handles the case where the position becomes `0` by converting it to `n`.
     - Prints the number of unique positions and the sorted list of these positions.
   - **Functionality**: The logic correctly handles the possible positions of the ball after each throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise movements when the direction is unknown ('?').

### Conclusion:
All functions together correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program reads the input, processes the throws, and outputs the correct possible positions of the ball after the game is interrupted.

### Correctness: **True**
