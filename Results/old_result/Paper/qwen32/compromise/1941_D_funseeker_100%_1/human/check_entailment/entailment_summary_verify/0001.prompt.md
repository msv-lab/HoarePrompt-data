You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

from functools import lru_cache
#Function 1:

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function calculates and prints the number of unique player positions that can be reached after `m` throws of a ball, starting from player `x` among `n` players, based on the operations defined by `r` and `c` for each throw. It also prints the sorted list of these unique positions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline()` to read input line by line, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - It defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) to parse integers and lists of integers from the input.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` containing the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It updates the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball after each throw:
     - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the position after a clockwise throw: `(q + r) % n`.
     - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the position after a counterclockwise throw: `(q - r) % n`.
   - The `% n` operation ensures that the position wraps around the circle correctly.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced with `n` because player numbers are 1-based.
   - This step ensures that the output player numbers are within the valid range `[1, n]`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all throws, the program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for updating the set `ans` with possible positions after each throw is correct.
  - The use of a set ensures that each player number is unique.
  - The handling of the 1-based indexing by converting `0` to `n` is appropriate.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where the direction is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both possible directions.
  - It also correctly handles the wrapping around of player positions using the modulo operation.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of a set for `ans` and the efficient input reading methods ensure that the program can handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently processes each test case and handles all specified edge cases.
