The code snippet assigns the result of the function `func_2` called with the arguments `a[1:]` and `n - 1` to the variable `winNext`. This means that `winNext` now holds the value returned by `func_2` when it is called with the list `a` excluding its first element and the integer `n` decremented by 1.

The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged by this operation. The list `a` still represents the number of stones in each pile, and `n` still represents the number of piles, with the conditions that `n` is a positive integer not equal to 1 or 2.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of piles such that `n == len(a)` and `n` is not equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**.
