Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where players take stones from piles in a specific way. The key point is that in each turn, a player must remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile, and the number of stones removed cannot exceed the size of the smallest non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed using the concept of Grundy numbers (or Nimbers) from combinatorial game theory. However, a simpler observation can be made based on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, the first player (Alice) can force a win. If it's even, the second player (Bob) can force a win. This is because each move can change the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function seems to be calculating some kind of differential array from the sorted unique elements of the list `a`. However, this does not directly relate to determining the winner of the game.
   - For example, if `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, `func_1(a)` will return `[3]` because all elements are the same, and the differential array will only have one element.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine the winner based on the configuration of the piles.
   - The base cases handle specific scenarios for `n = 1` and `n = 2`, but these do not cover the general case.
   - The recursive call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` is intended to determine the winner for the remaining piles, but the logic is flawed. It does not correctly account for the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. It does not consider the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones, which is the correct approach to solving this problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should count the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If this count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
