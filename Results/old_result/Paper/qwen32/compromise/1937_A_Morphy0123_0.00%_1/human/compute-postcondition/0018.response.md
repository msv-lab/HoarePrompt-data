Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1 (though it is not directly used in the provided code snippet).
- `i` is 0 (though it is also not directly used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `power` is defined as `ceil(log2(n)) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: It is an input integer and not equal to 1.
2. **`log2(n)`**: This function computes the base-2 logarithm of `n`. For example, if `n` is 10, `log2(10)` is approximately 3.3219.
3. **`ceil(log2(n))`**: The `ceil` function rounds up to the nearest integer. So, if `n` is 10, `ceil(log2(10))` is 4.
4. **`power`**: It is calculated as `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`. Continuing the example with `n` being 10, `power` would be 4 - 1 = 3.
5. **`2 ** power`**: This expression computes 2 raised to the power of `power`. If `power` is 3, then `2 ** 3` is 8.

### Output:
The code prints `2` raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is ceil(log2(n)) - 1)**
