To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n` in this case.

The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.

Given the current state:
- `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `power` is 3

We need to ensure that `power < log2(n)` holds true. Since `power` is 3, we need to make sure that `log2(n)` is greater than 3. This means `n` must be greater than \(2^3\), which is 8.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 8.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
