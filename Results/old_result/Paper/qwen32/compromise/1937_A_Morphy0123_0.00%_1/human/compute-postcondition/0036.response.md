To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's analyze the relevant variables and the print statement:

1. **Variables and their initial states:**
   - `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1 (though it's not directly used in the print statement).
   - `i` is set to 1 (though it's not directly used in the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer such that `16 <= n < 32` (though it's not directly used in the print statement).
   - `power` is set to 3.

2. **The print statement:**
   - `print(2 ** power)`

Given that `power` is explicitly set to 3, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** 3`, which is the mathematical operation of raising 2 to the power of 3.

3. **Calculation:**
   - `2 ** 3` is `2 * 2 * 2`, which equals 8.

Thus, the print statement will output the result of this calculation.

Output: **8**
