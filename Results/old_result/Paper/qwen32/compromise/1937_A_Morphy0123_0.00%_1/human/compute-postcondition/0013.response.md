To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`. Each iteration increments `power` by 1.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `power` is 2, which means `n` must be greater than 2.
- After 2 iterations: `power` is 3, which means `n` must be greater than 4.
- After 3 iterations: `power` is 4, which means `n` must be greater than 8.

We can infer that after `k` iterations, `power` will be `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than \(2^k\).

The loop will terminate when `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. Therefore, the final value of `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. This is the definition of the ceiling of `log2(n)`, which we can denote as `ceil(log2(n))`.

Thus, the final `power` value will be `ceil(log2(n))`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state will be:
- `n_cases` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `power` will be `ceil(log2(n))`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `power` is `ceil(log2(n))`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`.
