Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the position of the element `1` in the resulting array after performing the specified swap operations. The logic in the program appears to be incorrect, particularly in how it calculates the position of `1`.

The correct position of `1` after performing the swap operations can be determined by recognizing that the position of `1` will be the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. This is because each swap operation moves `1` to the position of its largest proper divisor, and this process continues until `1` reaches a position that is a power of 2.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n
            power = 1
            while (power * 2) <= n:
                power *= 2
            print(power)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the position of `1` by iteratively finding the highest power of 2 that does not exceed `n`.
