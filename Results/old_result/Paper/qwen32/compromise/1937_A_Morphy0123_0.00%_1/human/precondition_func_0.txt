The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) which is the length of the array a. Initially, the array a is defined such that a_i = i for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The function should perform the swap operation for each i from 2 to n in order and find the position j such that a_j = 1 after all operations.
