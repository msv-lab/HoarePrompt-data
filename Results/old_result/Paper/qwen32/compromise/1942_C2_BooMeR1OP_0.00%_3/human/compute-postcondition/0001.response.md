Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from input, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
