The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it computes and prints a list of `n` integers. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`. Otherwise, it calculates a sequence starting with the largest power of 2 less than `k`, followed by the remainder when `k` is subtracted by the sum of the sequence, and fills the rest of the list with zeros to ensure the list has `n` elements.
