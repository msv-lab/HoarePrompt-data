The code snippet `temp *= 2` doubles the value of `temp`. Given that `temp * 2` was initially less than `k`, after executing this line, `temp` will be twice its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is 2 (or `temp` is doubled from its initial value).**
