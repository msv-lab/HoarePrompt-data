The code snippet provided is:

```python
arr = []
```

This line of code reassigns `arr` to be an empty list. However, since `arr` was already initialized as an empty list in the Initial State, this operation does not change its value.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, except that the reassignment operation is noted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\), `k - (2^i - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\)**
