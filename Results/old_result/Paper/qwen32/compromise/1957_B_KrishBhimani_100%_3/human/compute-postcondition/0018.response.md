In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there is no `break` statement inside the loop. Therefore, no modifications to the program state are necessary to ensure that the next iteration of the loop can proceed.

The state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated as is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 1 or 2. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is doubled to 2 and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k` and `i` remains 0.**
