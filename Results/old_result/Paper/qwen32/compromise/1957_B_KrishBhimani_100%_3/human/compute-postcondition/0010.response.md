The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `temp` with the value `1`. None of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, `ans`) are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is 1.**
