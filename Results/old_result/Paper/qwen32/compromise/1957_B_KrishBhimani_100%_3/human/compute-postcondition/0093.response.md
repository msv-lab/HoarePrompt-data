The code appends a value to the list `ans`. Specifically, it appends `(1 << i) - 1`, which is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\). Here, `i` is the number of times `temp` (the largest power of 2 less than `k`) was doubled to reach its final value.

Since the value of `i` is determined by the doubling process of `temp` to reach a value just below `k`, the exact value of `i` depends on the initial value of `k`. However, the expression `(1 << i) - 1` calculates the maximum number that can be represented with `i+1` bits in binary, which is one less than the next power of 2.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the single element \((1 << i) - 1\); `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled to reach its final value.**
