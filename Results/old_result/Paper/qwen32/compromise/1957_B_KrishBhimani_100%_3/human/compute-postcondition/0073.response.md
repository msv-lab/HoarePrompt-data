The code snippet `ans = []` initializes the variable `ans` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of any other variables. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than the old `k`; `i` is 0**.
