To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and when it terminates.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `temp * 2 < k`.
- In each iteration, `temp` is doubled (`temp *= 2`) and `i` is incremented by 1 (`i += 1`).
- The loop terminates when `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.

### Given Information:
- Initial State: `temp = 1`, `i = 0`
- After 1st iteration: If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp = 2`, `i = 1`
- After 2nd iteration: If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp = 4`, `i = 2`
- After 3rd iteration: If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp = 8`, `i = 3`

### General Pattern:
- After `m` iterations, if `temp * 2 < k` holds true for all previous iterations, then `temp = 2^m` and `i = m`.

### Termination Condition:
- The loop stops when `temp * 2 >= k`.
- This means the last valid `temp` value before termination is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

### Final Output State:
- Let's denote the largest integer `m` such that `2^m < k` as `m_max`.
- At the end of the loop, `temp` will be `2^m_max` and `i` will be `m_max`.

### Conclusion:
- The final value of `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- The final value of `i` is the exponent of this power of 2.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`; `i` is the exponent of this power of 2.**

In simpler terms, the loop ends when `temp` reaches the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`, and `i` reflects how many times `temp` was doubled to reach that value.
