The given code snippet sets the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\), `k - (2^i - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is 0**.
