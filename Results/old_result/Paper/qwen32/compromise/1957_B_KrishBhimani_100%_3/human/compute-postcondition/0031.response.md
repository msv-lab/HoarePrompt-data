The code snippet appends zeros to the `ans` list until its length equals `n`. Given that `ans` initially contains two elements, the number of zeros appended will be `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\), `k - (2^i - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros; `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).**
