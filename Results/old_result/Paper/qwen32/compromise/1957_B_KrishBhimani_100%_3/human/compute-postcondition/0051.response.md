The given code snippet multiplies the variable `temp` by 2. We need to consider the initial conditions and how they affect the final state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `ans` is an empty list
- If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is set to 2 and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` remains 0.

Given the condition before the code snippet:
- If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` was initially 2.
- If `temp * 2 >= k`, then `temp` was initially 1.

After executing `temp *= 2`:
- If `temp` was initially 2, it becomes 4.
- If `temp` was initially 1, it becomes 2.

Other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; if `temp` was initially 2, `temp` is now 4, otherwise `temp` is now 2; `i` remains unchanged.**
