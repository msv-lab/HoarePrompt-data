Let's break down the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this particular print statement.

2. **l1**: A list of strings obtained from the new input. It contains at least two elements, which are `n` and `k`.

3. **n**: The integer value of the first element of `l1`. This represents the number of elements in the `ans` list.

4. **k**: The integer value of the second element of `l1`. This is used in the calculations for the `ans` list.

5. **arr**: An empty list. This list is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this particular print statement.

6. **k0**: Equal to `k`. This variable is also not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this particular print statement.

7. **ans**: A list containing `n` elements. The first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`, and the remaining `n-2` elements are `0`.

   - `(1 << i) - 1`: This expression calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and subtracts 1. Here, `i` is the number of times `temp` (the largest power of 2 less than `k`) was doubled to reach its final value. Essentially, `(1 << i) - 1` gives us the largest number with `i+1` bits set to 1 (a binary number consisting of `i+1` ones).

8. **temp**: The largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. This is used to determine the value of `i`.

9. **i**: The number of times `temp` was doubled to reach its final value. This is used to calculate the first element of the `ans` list.

Given these details, let's determine the exact values printed by the `print(*ans)` statement:

- The first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is the largest number with `i+1` bits set to 1.
- The second element of `ans` is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which is the remainder after subtracting the largest power of 2 less than `k` from `k`.
- The remaining `n-2` elements of `ans` are `0`.

Thus, the output will be a list starting with two specific numbers followed by `n-2` zeros.

Output: **[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)] + [0] * (n - 2) (where (1 << i) - 1 is the largest number with i+1 bits set to 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1) is the remainder after subtracting the largest power of 2 less than k from k, and n is the total number of elements in the ans list)**
