Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure that the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Logic in `func_1` function:**
   - **Separating Letters and Digits:**
     - The function iterates over each character in the password.
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   
   - **Checking Sorted Order:**
     - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
     - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   
   - **Checking the Order of Letters and Digits:**
     - It iterates over the password string to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If it finds such a case, it returns `'NO'`.
   
   - If all the above checks pass, it returns `'YES'`.

### Verification Against the Problem Requirements:
1. **Condition 1:**
   - The problem states that the input is valid, so we assume the password contains only lowercase Latin letters and digits. The program does not explicitly validate this, but it is assumed as per the problem description.

2. **Condition 2:**
   - The program checks that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and comparing consecutive characters. This is correctly implemented.

3. **Condition 3:**
   - The program checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version. This is correctly implemented.

4. **Condition 4:**
   - The program checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version. This is correctly implemented.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` checks if a given password meets the specified criteria: all letters must be in alphabetical order, all digits must be in ascending order, and no letter should be immediately followed by a digit. If the password meets these criteria, the function returns `'YES'`; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` and the overall program correctly implement all the conditions outlined in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
