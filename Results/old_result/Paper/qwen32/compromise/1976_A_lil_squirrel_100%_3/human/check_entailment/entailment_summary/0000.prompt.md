Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

# Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` checks if a given password, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, meets specific criteria: all letters must be in alphabetical order, all digits must be in ascending order, and no letter should be immediately followed by a digit. If the password meets these criteria, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
