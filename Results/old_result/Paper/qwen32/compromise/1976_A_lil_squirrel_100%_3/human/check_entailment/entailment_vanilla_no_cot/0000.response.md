Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify whether a given password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Here's a breakdown of the program to confirm its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Separation of Letters and Digits:**
   - It iterates through each character in the password.
   - Digits are appended to the `digits` list, and letters are appended to the `letters` list.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Digit After Letter Check:**
   - It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit appears immediately after a letter.

5. **Output:**
   - If any of the conditions fail, it returns "NO".
   - If all conditions are satisfied, it returns "YES".

The program correctly handles the given problem constraints and the logic aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
