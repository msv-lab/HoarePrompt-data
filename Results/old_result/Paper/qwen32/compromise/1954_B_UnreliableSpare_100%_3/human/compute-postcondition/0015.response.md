Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the properties of the list `a`, which is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition.**
