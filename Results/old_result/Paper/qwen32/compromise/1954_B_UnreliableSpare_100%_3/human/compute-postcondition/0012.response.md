Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is False because not all elements in `arr` are the same; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the count of the last consecutive sequence of `val` at the end of `arr` (if any)**
