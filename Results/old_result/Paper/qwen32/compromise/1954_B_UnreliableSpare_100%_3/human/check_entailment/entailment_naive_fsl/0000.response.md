Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for the requirement to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not properly handle arrays with multiple segments of different elements.

Let's analyze the given program:

1. The program checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because a uniform array is always beautiful.
2. If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same element and outputs this value as the answer.

However, this approach is incorrect because the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, not just finding the shortest segment of identical elements.

### Counterexample

Consider the following test case:
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```

The correct output should be `1` because removing any one element (e.g., the second element) will make the array `[1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful. However, the program will output `2` because the shortest segment of identical elements is of length `2` (either `[1, 1]` or `[2, 2]`).

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider all possible ways to remove elements and check if the resulting array is still beautiful. This involves more sophisticated logic than simply finding the shortest segment of identical elements.

### Conclusion

Since the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
