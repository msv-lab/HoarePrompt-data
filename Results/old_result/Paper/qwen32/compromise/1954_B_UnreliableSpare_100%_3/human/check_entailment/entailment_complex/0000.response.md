### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. If not all elements are the same, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array before the last sequence of that element and outputs this value.

However, there are a few issues with the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Consecutive Sequence Length**:
   - The current implementation calculates the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the first element (`arr[0]`) before the last sequence of that element. This is not necessarily the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the smallest segment of the array that, if removed, will break the "beautiful" property of the array. This means finding the smallest segment such that removing it will result in at least one pair of adjacent elements that do not satisfy the condition `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.

2. **Handling of Consecutive Sequences**:
   - The program only considers consecutive sequences of the first element (`arr[0]`). This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. We need to consider all possible segments in the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array has multiple different elements in a way that it can determine the correct minimum number of elements to remove.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness: **False**
