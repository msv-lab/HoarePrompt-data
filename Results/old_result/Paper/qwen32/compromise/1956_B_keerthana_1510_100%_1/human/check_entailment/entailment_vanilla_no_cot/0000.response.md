Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply calculates the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand and outputs that as the score, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

The problem requires simulating the game where both players play optimally. Nene will always try to maximize her score and minimize the player's score, which means that the player should also play optimally to maximize their points. The optimal strategy involves careful selection of cards based on the current state of the table and the opponent's potential moves.

The given program does not account for the dynamic and strategic nature of the game, and thus it will not produce the correct maximum number of points the player can achieve.
