To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The loop processes each line from the input starting from the third line (index 2, considering 0-based indexing) and stepping by 2 lines each time. For each processed line, it splits the line into tokens, calculates the number of tokens, and then calculates the number of unique tokens. The difference between these two values is printed, which represents the number of duplicate tokens in the line.

Given the problem constraints:
- Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards.
- This is followed by a list of `n` integers, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times.

Since the code processes each test case's list of integers, and for each test case, it calculates the number of duplicates, the output will be the number of duplicate integers in each test case's list.

However, the problem statement does not provide specific input values, so we will describe the output state in general terms.

For each test case, the output will be the number of duplicate integers in the list of integers provided for that test case. As the loop processes each test case, it will print the number of duplicates for that particular test case.

Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases in the input, we assume there is only one test case in the input. Therefore, the output state will be the number of duplicate integers in the single list of integers provided.

Output State: **Number of duplicate integers in the list provided for the single test case.**
