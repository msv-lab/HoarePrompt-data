Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has a different length than the original and must have at least one element, `rev_res` is a concatenation of original strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, and `x` is an integer such that `x % 2 != 0`.**
