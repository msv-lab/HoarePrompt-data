Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has a different length than the original and must have at least one element, `rev_res` is a concatenation of original strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string has the same length as the original, plus `str(val_in)` if `x` is even, or the original form of `val_in` if `x` is odd, plus the reverse of the current `val_in` if `x` is odd, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, and `x` is incremented by 1. If `x` is even, `val_in` is an integer equal to `int(rev_val[x])`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is `rev_val[x]`.**
