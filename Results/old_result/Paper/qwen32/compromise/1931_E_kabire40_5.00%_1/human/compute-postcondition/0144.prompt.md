Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rev_res` is a concatenation of all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` equals the length of `x[::-1]`. `y` is `y_initial + n`. `rev_val` is a sorted list of `x[::-1]` for all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` does not equal the length of `x[::-1]`. `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rev_res` is a concatenation of all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` equals the length of `x[::-1]`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the reverse of `val_in`. `y` is `y_initial + n`. `rev_val` is a sorted list of `x[::-1]` for all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` does not equal the length of `x[::-1]` and must have at least one element. `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values. `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the element at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rev_res` is a concatenation of all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` equals the length of `x[::-1]`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the reverse of `val_in`. Additionally, if `x` is even, `rev_res` is concatenated with the string representation of `val_in` again; otherwise, it is concatenated with the reverse of `val_in`. `y` is `y_initial + n`. `rev_val` is a sorted list of `x[::-1]` for all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` does not equal the length of `x[::-1]` and must have at least one element. `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values. `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the element at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is odd. `x` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rev_res` is a concatenation of all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` equals the length of `x[::-1]`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the string representation of `val_in` twice. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the reverse of `val_in` twice. `y` is `y_initial + n`. `rev_val` is a sorted list of `x[::-1]` for all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` does not equal the length of `x[::-1]` and must have at least one element. `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values. `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the element at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is odd. `x` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
