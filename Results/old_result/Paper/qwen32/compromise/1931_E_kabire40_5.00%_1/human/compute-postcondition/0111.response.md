Postcondition: **`rev_res` is `x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string. `y` is [previous value of y] + 1, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`, otherwise `rev_val` is an empty list. `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`, and `x_rev` retain their initial values.**
