The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, which are then assigned to `list_len` and `max_power`. The values of `t`, `y`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space.**
