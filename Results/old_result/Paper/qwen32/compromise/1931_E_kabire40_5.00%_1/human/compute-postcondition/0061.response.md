Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces and must have at least one string, `x` is the first string in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string `x`.**
