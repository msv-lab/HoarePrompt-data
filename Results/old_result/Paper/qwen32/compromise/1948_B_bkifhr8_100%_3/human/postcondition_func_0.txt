The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be modified by a specific rule (replacing a pair of adjacent numbers with a new number formed by concatenating the digits of the larger number followed by the smaller number, ensuring the resulting sequence is sorted) such that the final list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It prints 'YES' if the condition can be met for the test case, otherwise 'NO'.
