Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`. `nums` is a list created by concatenating the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` with the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains `True`.**

In simple terms, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be equal to the first element of the list `nums`. All other variables retain their initial values unless `nums` is not sorted, in which case `ans` is set to `False` and the loop is broken.
