The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, and the loop will decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `ans` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is `True`**
