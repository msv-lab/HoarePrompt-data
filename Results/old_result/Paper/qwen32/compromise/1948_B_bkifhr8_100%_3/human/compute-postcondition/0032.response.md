Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is `False` if any `nums` was unsorted during the loop, otherwise `True`**

Explanation: The value of `arr` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `ans`) remain unchanged in terms of their initial conditions and values.
