The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` modifies the value of `arr` at index `i - 1` to be the first element of `nums`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `arr[1]` will be updated to `nums[0]`.

The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, and `nums` is a list formed by the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`. Therefore, `nums[0]` is the first digit of `arr[1]`.

Let's update the state accordingly:

- `arr[1]` is now `nums[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr[2]`, `i`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged as well, unless it was set to `False` in a previous step due to `nums` not being sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[1]` is now `nums[0]` and the rest of the elements remain as in the initial state, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list formed by the digits of the original `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`, and `ans` retains its previous value.**
