The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This change does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, or the condition under which `ans` was initially `False`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is `True`**.
