Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is assigned the value of the input integer, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
