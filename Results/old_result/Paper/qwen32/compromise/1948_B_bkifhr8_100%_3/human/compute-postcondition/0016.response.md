The code snippet directly assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. This change affects the value of `ans` while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is `False`, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers created by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` with `arr[i]`.**
