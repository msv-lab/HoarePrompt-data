The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the for loop statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop runs from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99
- `m` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- At the current index `i`, if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be `nums[0]`, where `nums` is a list created by concatenating the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` with the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not equal to its sorted version, `ans` is set to `False`; otherwise, `ans` remains `True`. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains `True` and the other variables are unchanged.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current index, for the next iteration `i` should be `i - 1`. The value of `m` does not need to be changed because the loop range is defined by `m - 1` down to `1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i - 1`**
