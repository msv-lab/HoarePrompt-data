The code snippet sets `ans` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is False, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list formed by the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`.**
