To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range function produces at least one value. The `range(m - 1, 0, -1)` function will produce values starting from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive) if `m - 1` is greater than or equal to `1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least `2`.

Here are the variables in the loop head that can be adjusted:
- `i` (loop variable)
- `m` (upper bound of the range, adjusted to control the loop execution)

Given the provided state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99
- `m` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input
- `ans` is `True`

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `m`. We need to ensure that `m` is at least `2`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is `True`**
