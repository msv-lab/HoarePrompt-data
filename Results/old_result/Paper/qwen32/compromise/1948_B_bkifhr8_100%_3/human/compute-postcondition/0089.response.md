Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
