Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[1]` is now `nums[0]` and the rest of the elements remain as in the initial state, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list formed by the digits of the original `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`, and `ans` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `arr`, `nums`, and `ans` retain their initial values.**
