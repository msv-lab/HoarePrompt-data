To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `ans` is a boolean value.
- `i` is `m - 2`.

The code snippet converts the integer at the position `i - 1` in the `arr` list to a string, then converts each character of that string back to an integer, and finally appends the integer at the position `i` in the `arr` list to this list of integers.

So, the variable `nums` will be a new list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is assigned the value of `t`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is a boolean value; `i` is `m - 2`; `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**
