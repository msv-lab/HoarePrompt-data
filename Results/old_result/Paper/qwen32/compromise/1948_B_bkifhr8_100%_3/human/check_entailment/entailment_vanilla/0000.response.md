Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits and inserting them back into the array in the same position.

### Key Points:
1. **Splitting Elements**: If an element is 10 or greater, it can be split into its digits. For example, 12 can be split into 1 and 2.
2. **Sorting Check**: The goal is to check if it is possible to sort the array using the above operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one, it tries to split the previous element and checks if the resulting array (after insertion of digits) can be sorted.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program's logic for handling the splitting and checking is flawed. It only checks if the digits of the previous element and the current element can be sorted together, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.
2. **Insufficient Checks**: The program does not fully simulate the process of splitting and reordering the array to ensure that the entire array can be sorted. It only checks a limited condition.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program might fail for certain edge cases where multiple splits and reordering are necessary to sort the array.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
