Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements in all cases. Specifically, the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers is flawed.

The main issue is in the loop where the program checks if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
```
This logic only checks if the current element and the digits of the previous element can be rearranged to form a sorted sequence. However, this does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation.

Consider the following counterexample:
```
Input:
1
5
99 1 2 3 4

Output:
YES

Expected Output:
NO
```
In this case, the program will incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks local pairs and does not consider the global order after splitting the numbers. Specifically, it will check the pair (99, 1) and see that [9, 9, 1] can be rearranged to [1, 9, 9], but it will not correctly handle the subsequent elements to ensure the entire array is sorted.

A correct approach would involve a more comprehensive check to see if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting numbers, possibly using a more sophisticated algorithm or multiple passes to ensure the global order is maintained.
