### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying a specific operation: replacing an element that is at least 10 with its individual digits. The program iterates through each test case, checks if the array can be sorted by applying this operation, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

However, the logic in the program is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the immediate previous element can be split to make the sequence sorted, but it does not correctly handle the transformation or ensure that the entire sequence remains sorted after the operation.

Let's break down the issues:
1. **Incorrect Transformation Handling**: The program checks if the current element can be split in a way that makes the immediate sequence sorted, but it does not correctly simulate the transformation and check the entire sequence.
2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, checking if the current element can be split to make the sequence sorted. However, it does not correctly handle the transformation of the array elements and does not ensure that the entire sequence remains sorted after the operation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by applying the specified operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
