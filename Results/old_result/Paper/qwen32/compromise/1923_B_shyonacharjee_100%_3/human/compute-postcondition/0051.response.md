Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\) such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple and must contain at least one more tuple; `pos` and `health` are the values of the next tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + health`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `can_survive` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
