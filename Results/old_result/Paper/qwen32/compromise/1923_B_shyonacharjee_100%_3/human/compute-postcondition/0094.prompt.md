Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. x is a list of n integers where each element x_i satisfies -n <= x_i <= n, x_i are unique, and x is sorted in strictly increasing order. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
    bullets_used = 0
    can_survive = True
    for pos, health in monsters:
        distance = abs(pos)
        total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
        if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
            can_survive = False
            break
        bullets_used += health
    print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple; `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters processed before the loop breaks (or all monsters if the loop does not break); `can_survive` is `True` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is \(t-1\) such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple; `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all monsters if `can_survive` is `True`, otherwise it is the sum of the health of the monsters up to the point where the loop breaks; `can_survive` is `True` if the total bullets needed never exceeded the maximum bullets available for any monster, otherwise it is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is \(t-2\) such that \(0 \leq t-2 \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple; `bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all processed monsters; `can_survive` is `False` if the total bullets needed for any monster exceeded the allowed limit, otherwise `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
