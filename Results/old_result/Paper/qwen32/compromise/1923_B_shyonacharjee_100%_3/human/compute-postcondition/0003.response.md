The code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line.**
