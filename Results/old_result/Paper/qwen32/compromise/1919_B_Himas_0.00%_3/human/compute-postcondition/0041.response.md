Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000 (This variable `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 (This variable `n` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `s` is the input integer (The value of `s` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `e` is the input string.
- `P` is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` is the count of characters in `e` that are not '+'.
- `i` is `i + 1` (This statement modifies the value of `i`, but `i` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(P - M)
```

### Analysis:
- `P` is the number of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

The expression `P - M` calculates the difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `P - M`, which is the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the input string `e`.

Since the exact string `e` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `P - M`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated difference.

Output: **P - M (where P is the count of '+' characters in the string `e` and M is the count of characters in `e` that are not '+')**
