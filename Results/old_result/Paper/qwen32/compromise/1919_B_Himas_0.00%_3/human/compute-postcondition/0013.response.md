Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e` after the current value of `q`, `P` is 1 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `P` is 0, and `M` is 2 if `q` does not equal '+', otherwise `M` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `M` is incremented by 1. If `q` was not equal to '+', `M` was initially 1 and becomes 2. If `q` was equal to '+', `M` was initially 0 and becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
