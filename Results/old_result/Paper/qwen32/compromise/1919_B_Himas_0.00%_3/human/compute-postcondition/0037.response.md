Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `s` is the input integer, `e` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is `q_next`, `P` is `P + 1`**

In natural language, this means that the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `e`, `i`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
