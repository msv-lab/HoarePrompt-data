The value of `M` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string (e.g., "a"), `P` is 0, `M` is 1, and `q` is not equal to '+'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, and `q` is not equal to '+'**.
