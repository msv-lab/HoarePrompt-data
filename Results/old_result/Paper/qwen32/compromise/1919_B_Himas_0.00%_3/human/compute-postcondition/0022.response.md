The code snippet `s = int(input())` assigns a new integer value to the variable `s` based on the input provided. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `e`, `P`, `M`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the input integer, `e` is an input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in `e`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
