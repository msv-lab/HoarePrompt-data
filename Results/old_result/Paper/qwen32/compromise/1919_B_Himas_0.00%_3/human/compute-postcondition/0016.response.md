The value of `P` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `q` equals '+', `P` was initially 2 and will now be 3. Otherwise, `P` was initially 1 and will now be 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `e`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e` after its current value, `P` is 3 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `P` is 2, `M` is 1 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `M` is 2.**
