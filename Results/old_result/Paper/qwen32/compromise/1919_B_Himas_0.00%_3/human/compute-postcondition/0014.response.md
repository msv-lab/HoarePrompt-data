Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e` after the current value of `q`. If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.**
