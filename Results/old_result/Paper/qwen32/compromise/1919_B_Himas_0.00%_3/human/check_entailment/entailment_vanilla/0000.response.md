Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum penalty for splitting a string `s` into subarrays, where each subarray's penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of its elements (where '+' is 1 and '-' is -1) multiplied by the length of the subarray. The goal is to minimize the total penalty.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to calculate the minimum penalty. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program does and how it differs from the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` (which is not used in the subsequent logic).
   - It then reads the string `s`.

2. **Counting '+' and '-':**
   - The program initializes two counters `P` and `M` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and increments `P` for each '+' and `M` for each '-'.

3. **Calculating Penalty:**
   - The program prints `P - M` which is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' in the string.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Penalty Calculation:** The program does not actually calculate the penalty as per the problem statement. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum times its length, not the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.
- **Subarray Splitting:** The program does not perform any splitting of the array into subarrays. It simply calculates a single value for the entire array, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.
- **Output:** The output of the program is not the minimum penalty but rather the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one would need to implement an algorithm that tries different ways to split the array and calculates the total penalty for each split. The goal is to find the split that minimizes the total penalty. This could involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach, depending on the complexity requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues outlined above, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
