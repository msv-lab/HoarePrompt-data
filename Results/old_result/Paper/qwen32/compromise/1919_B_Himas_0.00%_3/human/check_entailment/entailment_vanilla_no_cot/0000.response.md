Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not correspond to the minimum penalty as defined in the problem statement.

The problem requires splitting the string into non-empty subarrays in such a way that the total penalty, calculated as the sum of the penalties of each subarray, is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

The current program does not perform any splitting of the array and does not calculate the penalties as described. Instead, it simply outputs the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not related to the penalty calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
