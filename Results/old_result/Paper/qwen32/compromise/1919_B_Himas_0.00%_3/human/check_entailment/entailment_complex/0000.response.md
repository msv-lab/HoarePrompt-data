Reasoning: The provided function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The task is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array derived from the string into subarrays, calculating the penalty for each subarray, and summing these penalties. The given function instead simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference, which does not address the problem's requirements.

The function should consider all possible ways to split the array and calculate the penalty for each configuration, then choose the one with the minimum total penalty. The provided function does not perform any splitting or penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
