Output State: **`a` is updated such that `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `k` is `0` if the initial `k` was sufficient to cover all the reductions, otherwise, it is the remaining value; `ans` is `a[0] * (a[i] - a[i - 1]) * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2**.

The value of `ans` has been updated to include the product of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` again. All other variables remain as they were described in the initial state.
