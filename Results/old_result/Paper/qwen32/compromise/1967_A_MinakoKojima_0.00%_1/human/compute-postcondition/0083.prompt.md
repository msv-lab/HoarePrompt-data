Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. Additionally, each test case contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12), where a_i represents the number of cards of type i initially available. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is given at the start of the input, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` (number of test cases) is greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n` multiplied by `m`, then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `a` is updated such that `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i`, and `ans` is the product of all differences `a[i] - a[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`. `m` is the minimum value in the list `a` before the updates.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a` before the updates. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `a` is updated such that `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `ans` is the product of all differences `a[i] - a[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a` after the updates. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `a` is updated such that `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `0` if the initial `k` was sufficient to cover all the reductions, otherwise, it is the remaining value, and `ans` is the product of all differences `a[i] - a[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
