Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is [0]; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0; `v` is 0 and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
