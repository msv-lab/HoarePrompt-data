To ensure that the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that the condition `remaining_vertices` is not empty when the loop is reached. The loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` contains at least one element.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`.

The `while` loop condition is `while remaining_vertices`, which means the loop will execute if `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

Since `remaining_vertices` is initially a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, it should not be empty as long as `n` is a positive integer within the given range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `remaining_vertices` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`**
