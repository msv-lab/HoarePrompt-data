The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` assigns the first and second return values of `func_1(d)` to `v` and `u`, respectively. This means that `v` and `u` will now hold the values returned by `func_1` when called with the argument `d`.

Given that `d` is `d - 2` before this line, the value of `d` is decremented by 2 before `func_1(d)` is called. However, the specific values of `v` and `u` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. Therefore, we can only state that `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`.

The output state will reflect the updated values of `v` and `u` and the fact that `d` has been decremented by 2. The other variables (`n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 2`.**
