Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. The vertex `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `u`, `v`, and `d` remain unchanged, except that we have exited the most internal loop or if statement.
