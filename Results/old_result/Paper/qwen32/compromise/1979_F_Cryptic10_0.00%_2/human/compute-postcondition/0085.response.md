To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the state of `path` and `remaining_vertices`.

The loop iterates from `d` ranging from `n-1` down to `0`. In each iteration, it calls `func_1(d)` which returns two values `v` and `u`. If `v` is `0`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it appends `v` to `path`, removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`, and breaks out of the loop.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until it finds a `v` that is in `remaining_vertices` or until `d` reaches `0`.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop starts with `d = n-1`.
2. For each iteration, it checks if `v` (returned by `func_1(d)`) is in `remaining_vertices`.
3. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it appends `v` to `path`, removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`, and breaks out of the loop.
4. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` or `v` is `0`, it continues to the next iteration with `d = d - 1`.

The loop will terminate either when it finds a valid `v` in `remaining_vertices` or when `d` becomes `-1` (indicating all iterations are completed).

**Output State:**
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the number of vertices in the graph.
- `path` will contain the vertex `v` if `v` was found in `remaining_vertices` during any iteration. If `v` is found, it will be appended to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`.
- `remaining_vertices` will be missing the vertex `v` if `v` was found in `remaining_vertices` during any iteration. If no valid `v` was found, `remaining_vertices` will remain unchanged from its initial state except for the vertex `u` that was added back to `remaining_vertices` initially.

In summary, the loop will continue until it finds a vertex `v` in `remaining_vertices` or exhausts all iterations. If a valid `v` is found, it will be added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`. If no valid `v` is found, `path` and `remaining_vertices` will remain in their initial states except for the vertex `u` that was added back to `remaining_vertices`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` if `v` was found in `remaining_vertices` during any iteration, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the vertex `v` if `v` was found in `remaining_vertices` during any iteration. If no valid `v` was found, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain in their initial states except for the vertex `u` that was added back to `remaining_vertices`.**
