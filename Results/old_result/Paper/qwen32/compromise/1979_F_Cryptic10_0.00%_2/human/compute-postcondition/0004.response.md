The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_1(d)` to the variables `v` and `u`. Since the function `func_1` and its parameter `d` are not defined in the initial state, we can't determine the exact values of `v` and `u`. However, we can state that `v` and `u` will hold whatever values are returned by `func_1(d)`.

The other variables (`n`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
