To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop evolves and what conditions cause it to terminate.

The loop iterates from `d = n - 1` down to `d = 0`, calling `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u` each time. The loop continues to the next iteration if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` or `v` is 0. When `v` is found in `remaining_vertices`, it is appended to `path`, removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the loop breaks.

Given the descriptions of the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we infer that the loop will continue until it finds a `v` that is in `remaining_vertices` or `d` reaches 0.

The final output state will depend on when the loop breaks. If the loop breaks because `v` is found in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` will contain the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain `v`. If the loop completes all iterations without finding such a `v`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` will remain unchanged from their initial state (except for the initial `v` that was added to `path` at the start).

Let's consider both cases:

1. **Loop breaks because `v` is found in `remaining_vertices`:**
   - `path` will contain the initial `v` and the new `v` found in `remaining_vertices`.
   - `remaining_vertices` will not contain the initial `v` and the new `v`.

2. **Loop completes all iterations without finding `v` in `remaining_vertices`:**
   - `path` will only contain the initial `v`.
   - `remaining_vertices` will not contain the initial `v` but will contain all other vertices except the initial `u`.

Given the nature of the loop and the provided output states, the most general final output state is when the loop completes all iterations without finding a valid `v` in `remaining_vertices`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`.**

In natural language: The final state is that `n` remains the same, `path` contains only the initial vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` contains all vertices from 1 to `n` except the initial `v` and `u`, which was added back to `remaining_vertices`.
