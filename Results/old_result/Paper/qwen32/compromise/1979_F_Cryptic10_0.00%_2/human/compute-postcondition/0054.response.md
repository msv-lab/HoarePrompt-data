The code snippet `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the vertex `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Given the initial state, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`. After executing the code, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, and now includes `v` as its last element; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`, and now `v` is also removed from `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 2`. If `v` is 0, the program continues with the unchanged state described above. Otherwise, the program continues with the unchanged state described above.**
