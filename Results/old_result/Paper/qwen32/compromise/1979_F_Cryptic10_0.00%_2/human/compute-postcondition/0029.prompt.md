Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. `path` is [0] if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n`. `v` is 0 and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `v` remains 0. `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and remains unchanged. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is `[0, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and `v`, otherwise `path` is `[v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(1)`; `u` is the second return value of `func_1(1)`; `d` is 1. If `v` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)` and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`. `d` is 0. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is `[0, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and `v`. If `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is `[v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
