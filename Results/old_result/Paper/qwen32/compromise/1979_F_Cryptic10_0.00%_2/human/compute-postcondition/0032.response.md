To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line `v, u = func_1(d)`. This line suggests that `func_1(d)` returns a tuple containing two values, which are then unpacked into `v` and `u`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and one vertex `u` (where `u` is not equal to `v` and 1 <= u <= n) is added back to `remaining_vertices`.

After the execution of `v, u = func_1(d)`, `v` and `u` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The specific values of `v` and `u` will depend on the implementation of `func_1(d)`, but we can assume that `func_1(d)` will return two valid vertices in the graph.

Since `remaining_vertices` already contains all vertices from 1 to `n` except for the initial `v` and then `u` was added back, the set `remaining_vertices` will not be directly affected by the assignment of `v` and `u` from `func_1(d)`, unless `func_1(d)` modifies `remaining_vertices` internally, which is not indicated in the given information.

Thus, the output state will be:
- `n` remains a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` remains a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop.
- `remaining_vertices` remains a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except for the initial `v` and then `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`.
- `v` and `u` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
