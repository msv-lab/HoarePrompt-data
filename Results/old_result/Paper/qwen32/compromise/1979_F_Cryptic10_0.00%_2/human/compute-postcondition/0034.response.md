Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `v` is 0; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and is not changed; the loop continues to the next iteration.**

In simpler terms, the value of `v` remains 0, and the loop continues without changing any other variables.
