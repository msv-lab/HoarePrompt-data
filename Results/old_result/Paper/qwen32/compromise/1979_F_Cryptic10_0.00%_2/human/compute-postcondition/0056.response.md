Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added as the last element of `path`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u`, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is also removed from `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 2`. If `v` is 0, the program continues with the unchanged state described above. Otherwise, the program continues with the unchanged state described above and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
