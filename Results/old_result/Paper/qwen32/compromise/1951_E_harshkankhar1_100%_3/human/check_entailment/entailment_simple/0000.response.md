### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine if a given string can be partitioned into substrings, where each substring is not a palindrome. The program follows a specific logic to achieve this:

1. **Initial Check for the Entire String:**
   - The program first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s)`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it immediately prints "YES", outputs `1` as the number of partitions, and prints the entire string as the partition.

2. **Finding the First Non-Matching Character:**
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, the program searches for the first character `s[i]` that does not match the first character `s[0]`. This is done in a loop that iterates from `i = 1` to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the string. If such a character is found, its index `x` is stored.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If no such character is found (`x` remains `-1`), it means all characters in the string are the same, and thus, the string is a palindrome. In this case, the program prints "NO".
   - If a character is found (`x != -1`), the program then checks if the substring starting from `x+1` to the end of the string (`s[x+1:]`) is not a palindrome. If it is not a palindrome, the program prints "YES", outputs `2` as the number of partitions, and prints the substrings `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.

4. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - If the substring starting from `x+1` to the end is a palindrome, the program checks if `x` is either `1` or `n // 2`. If `x` is either `1` or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it is not possible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings in this case.
   - If `x` is neither `1` nor `n // 2`, the program prints "YES", outputs `2` as the number of partitions, and prints the substrings `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

The logic seems to cover all the necessary cases for partitioning the string into non-palindrome substrings, and the provided example outputs match the expected results.
