The provided initial state includes several variables and conditions but does not directly influence the print statement in the code snippet. The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`. The string `'YES'` is explicitly given and will be printed as is.

Output: **YES**
