The value of `list[i]` is updated to `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`. The other preconditions remain valid: `list[i]` must still be greater than 1, `list[i - 1]` must still be greater than 0, and `list[i + 1]` is `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1]` and must still be greater than 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list[i]` is `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`; `list[i]` must be greater than 1; `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0; `list[i + 1]` is `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.**
