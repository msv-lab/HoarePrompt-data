The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`. The initial state provides information about the list and the condition `list[i - 1]` is not 0, but these details do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('no')`.
2. The string `'no'` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.
3. The value of `'no'` does not change based on any conditions or variables in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
