To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state describes a list where:
- `list[2]` is 2
- `list[1]` is 1
- `list[3]` is 1
- The remaining elements are either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1.

The code snippet is:
```
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```
This means that the value at index `i + 1` of the list is decreased by the value at index `i - 1`.

Given the initial state, let's identify the values of `i - 1` and `i + 1` based on the indices provided in the initial state. Since `list[2]` is 2, and we know the values of `list[1]` and `list[3]`, we can assume `i` could be 2. 

If `i` is 2:
- `list[i - 1]` is `list[1]`, which is 1.
- `list[i + 1]` is `list[3]`, which is 1.

The operation then becomes:
```
list[3] -= 1 * list[1]
list[3] -= 1 * 1
list[3] -= 1
list[3] = 1 - 1
list[3] = 0
```

Thus, the value at `list[3]` changes from 1 to 0. 

The other elements of the list remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **The list is a list of integers where `list[2]` is 2, `list[1]` is 1, and `list[3]` is 0, and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1.**
