To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to carefully analyze the loop's behavior and the given output states after the first three iterations.

### Analysis of the Loop:
The loop condition is:
```python
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
```
And the loop body is:
```python
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```

### Iteration Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i]` is 2, `list[i + 1]` is some value (let's assume it's 1 for simplicity).
   
2. **After 1st Iteration**:
   - `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[3]` is 0.
   
3. **After 2nd Iteration**:
   - `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0 if `i` is 2, `list[3]` is 0 if `i` is 4.
   
4. **After 3rd Iteration**:
   - `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 1, `list[3]` is 1, `list[4]` is 1.

### Observations:
- The loop modifies the values of `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` based on the conditions.
- After the first iteration, `list[2]` becomes 0, and `list[1]` and `list[3]` are adjusted.
- After the third iteration, `list[1]`, `list[3]`, and `list[4]` are all set to 1, and `list[2]` remains 0.

### Conclusion:
The loop will not execute further because after the third iteration, the condition `list[i] > 1` is no longer satisfied (since `list[2]` is 0 and `list[4]` is 1, but `i` would need to be 3, and `list[3]` is 1, which does not satisfy `list[i] > 1`).

### Final Output State:
The final state of the list after all iterations is:
- `list[2]` is 0.
- `list[1]` is 1.
- `list[3]` is 1.
- `list[4]` is 1.
- All other elements remain either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1.

Output State: **The list is a list of integers where `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 1, `list[3]` is 1, `list[4]` is 1, and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1.**
