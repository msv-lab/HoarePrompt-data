The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to 0, because subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` from itself results in 0.

Given that the initial state specifies `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 2`, and `list[2] = -4`, and `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, we need to determine the effect of the code on `list[i - 1]`.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume that `i` is a variable that might have been set elsewhere in the program. However, the code operates on `list[i - 1]`, so we can infer that `i` must be a valid index for the list, which means `1 <= i <= 3` given the initial state of the list.

For the sake of this task, let's consider the possible values of `i` and their effects:

1. If `i = 1`, then `list[0]` will be set to 0.
2. If `i = 2`, then `list[1]` will be set to 0.
3. If `i = 3`, then `list[2]` will be set to 0.

Since the specific value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe the output state in terms of the possible changes to the list.

Output State: **`list` is a list of integers where `list[0]` is either 0 or 1, `list[1]` is either 0 or 2, `list[2]` is either 0 or -4; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. The specific element in `list` that was modified is set to 0.**

However, if we assume `i` is a specific value, we can provide a more concrete output state. For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i = 2` (a common middle index).

If `i = 2`, then `list[1]` will be set to 0.

Output State: **`list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 0`, `list[2] = -4`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.**
