To determine the final state of the list after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the list and under what conditions it continues to execute.

The provided loop modifies the list based on the values of three consecutive elements: `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]`. The loop continues to execute as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`. During each iteration, the following changes occur:

1. `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
2. `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
3. `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` (which effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to 0)

Let's analyze the given output states after the first three iterations:

1. **After the 1st iteration:**
   - `list[0] = 1`
   - `list[1] = 0`
   - `list[2] = -4`
   - This implies that `list[0]` was originally greater than 0, and `list[1]` and `list[2]` were greater than 0 before the iteration. The value of `list[0]` was reduced to 1, `list[1]` was reduced to 0, and `list[2]` was reduced by the value of `list[0]`.

2. **After the 2nd iteration:**
   - `list[0]` is 0 if `i` is 1.
   - `list[1]` is 0 if `i` is 2.
   - `list[2]` is 0 if `i` is 3.
   - `list[1]` is either 2 or 0 if `i` is not 2.
   - `list[2]` is either 0 or -4 if `i` is not 3.
   - This suggests that `list[1]` and `list[2]` were reduced to 0 in the previous iteration, and the loop moved to the next set of elements.

3. **After the 3rd iteration:**
   - `list[i]` is `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]` and must be greater than 1.
   - `list[i - 1]` is 0.
   - `list[i + 1]` is `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1]` and must be greater than 0.
   - This indicates that the loop continues to modify the list by reducing the values of `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` based on the value of `list[i - 1]`, which is already 0.

Given these observations, the loop will continue to execute until no more elements satisfy the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`. Since `list[i-1]` is set to 0 in each iteration, the loop will effectively reduce the list to a state where most elements are 0, and the remaining elements are either 1 or less.

The final state of the list will be such that all elements are either 0 or 1, and no element will be greater than 1. The exact positions of 1s will depend on the initial values of the list, but the loop will ensure that no element greater than 1 remains.

**Output State: **The list will be a list of integers where most elements are 0, and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1.**

In natural language, the final state of the list will be a list of mostly zeros, with some ones scattered throughout, ensuring no element in the list is greater than 1.
