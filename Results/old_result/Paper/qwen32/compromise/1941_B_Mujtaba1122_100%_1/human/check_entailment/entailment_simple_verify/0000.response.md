### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Operation**: For an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)), the operation changes the array as follows:
  - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
  - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
  - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)
- **Goal**: Determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the above operation any number of times.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise. This function is correctly implemented.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to apply the described operation to make all elements zero. However, there are significant issues with the implementation:
  - **Incorrect Operation**: The operation in the code is:
    ```python
    list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
    list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    ```
    This does not match the intended operation. The correct operation should be:
    ```python
    list[i + 1] -= 1
    list[i] -= 2
    list[i - 1] -= 1
    ```
  - **Logic Error**: The loop and the condition inside the loop are not correctly handling the operations. The current implementation incorrectly modifies the array elements based on the wrong formula, leading to incorrect results.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the incorrect operation is being performed. The annotations also indicate that the list is not being modified as intended, and the final check for all zeros is not meaningful due to the incorrect operations.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of the operation. The explanation provided is accurate and highlights the issues with the code.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

**Final: False**
