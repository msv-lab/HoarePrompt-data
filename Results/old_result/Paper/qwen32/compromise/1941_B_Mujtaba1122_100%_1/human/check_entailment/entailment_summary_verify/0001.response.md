### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summaries provided.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if we can make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation: choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and updating the array elements as follows:
- `a[i - 1] = a[i - 1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i + 1] = a[i + 1] - 1`

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program has two functions:
1. **`func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It correctly returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.

2. **`func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by applying the described operation.
   - The function iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive) and applies the operation while certain conditions are met.
   - The operation logic in the loop is incorrect:
     - It incorrectly modifies the array elements by multiplying the decrements by `list[i - 1]`, which is not the intended operation.
     - Specifically, `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` are incorrect.
     - The correct operation should be `list[i + 1] -= 1`, `list[i] -= 2`, and `list[i - 1] -= 1`.
   - The function checks if `list[i - 1]` is not zero and prints 'no' and returns immediately, which is incorrect because it should continue trying other operations.
   - The final check using `func_1` is correct, but due to the incorrect operation logic, the array may not be properly reduced to zeros.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` states that it processes a list of integers by modifying its elements based on specific rules and checks if the list can be transformed into a sequence of 1s followed by 0s. However, this is not accurate based on the problem description and the provided code.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the operation logic and the premature termination in `func_2`, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
