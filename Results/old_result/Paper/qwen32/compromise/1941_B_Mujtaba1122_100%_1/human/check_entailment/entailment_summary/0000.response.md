Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior in the context of the problem description.

The given problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows reducing elements around a chosen index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Function 1: `func_1`
This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. This function is correctly used to verify the final state of the array after potential modifications.

### Function 2: `func_2`
This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operation. Here's the detailed reasoning:
- It iterates through the array from the second element to the second-to-last element (i.e., `i` ranges from 1 to `n-2`).
- For each index `i`, it checks if the current element `list[i]` and its neighbors `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are positive.
- If all three are positive, it modifies the elements as per the operation rules:
  - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
  - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
- This loop continues until one of the conditions (all three being positive) fails.
- After the loop, it checks if `list[i-1]` is zero. If not, it immediately prints "no" and returns, indicating that it's impossible to make the array zero.
- If the loop completes and all elements are zero, it calls `func_1` to verify and prints "YES" if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise "NO".

### Issues with `func_2`
The main issue with `func_2` is the logic used to modify the array elements. The current implementation subtracts `list[i-1]` times the operation values from the neighbors, which is not aligned with the problem's operation rules. The correct operation should subtract 1, 2, and 1 from `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` respectively, regardless of the value of `list[i-1]`.

### Correct Implementation
A correct implementation would look like this:
```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i - 1] -= 1
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('NO')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Conclusion
Given the incorrect logic in `func_2`, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be made zero using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
