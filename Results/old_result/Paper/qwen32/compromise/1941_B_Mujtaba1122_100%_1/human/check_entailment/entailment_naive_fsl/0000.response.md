Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Implementation of the Operation**:
   - The operation specified in the problem description is:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - However, in the provided code, the operation is incorrectly implemented as:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This does not match the intended operation and will not correctly simulate the described behavior.

2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the logic to make all elements zero. It incorrectly modifies the array elements based on the wrong formula.
   - The logic for checking if all elements are zero is correct (`func_1`), but the main logic for performing the operations is flawed.

3. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     5
     1 3 5 5 2
     ```
   - The correct operations would be:
     - Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
     - Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
     - Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
     - Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - However, the provided code does not perform these operations correctly and will likely output "NO" for this case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where the array cannot be made zero, but it also fails to correctly handle cases where it can be made zero due to the incorrect implementation of the operation.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
