Output State: **arr is a list of integers; new_segment is [5, 6]; max_segment is [5, 3]; segments_variants is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [5, 3, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; max_sum is -1; total_max_segment is [-1]; the length of total_max_segment is 1**

In this output state, the value of `total_max_segment` has been changed to `[-1]`. All other variables remain with their initial values.
