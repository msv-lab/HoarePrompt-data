Let's analyze the given loop and how it modifies the variables based on the initial state provided.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `new_segment` is an empty list.
- `max_segment` is [0, 0].
- `segments_variants` is an empty list.
- `max_sum` is -1.

The loop iterates through each element in `arr`. Here's a breakdown of what happens inside the loop:

1. If `new_segment` is not empty:
   - If the current element in `arr` is negative:
     - Compare `max_segment` and `new_segment`. Append the larger one to `segments_variants` along with the index of the current element minus one.
     - Set `new_segment` to an empty list.
     - Update `max_segment[0]` by adding the current element (which is negative).
   - If the current element in `arr` is non-negative:
     - Update both `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]` by adding the current element.

2. If `new_segment` is empty:
   - If the current element in `arr` is non-negative:
     - Initialize `new_segment` with the current element and its index.
   - Update `max_segment[0]` by adding the current element.

However, there is a logical error in the provided code that needs to be addressed for the loop to function as intended. Specifically, `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` is executed regardless of whether `new_segment` is empty or not, which is likely incorrect. Assuming the intention was to only add to `max_segment[0]` when `new_segment` is not empty, here's how the loop would behave:

- `new_segment` will keep track of the current contiguous segment of non-negative numbers.
- `max_segment` will keep track of the segment with the highest sum encountered so far.
- `segments_variants` will store segments that have been completed (i.e., followed by a negative number or reaching the end of the array).
- `max_sum` is not used within the loop but remains unchanged as -1.

Given the initial state and the corrected understanding of the loop, let's consider an example `arr` to see how the output state would look.

Example `arr`: `[1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`

1. `i=0`: `new_segment=[1, 0]`, `max_segment=[1, 0]`
2. `i=1`: `new_segment=[3, 0]`, `max_segment=[3, 0]`
3. `i=2`: `segments_variants=[[3, 1]]`, `new_segment=[]`, `max_segment=[2, 0]`
4. `i=3`: `new_segment=[3, 3]`, `max_segment=[3, 3]`
5. `i=4`: `new_segment=[7, 3]`, `max_segment=[7, 3]`
6. `i=5`: `segments_variants=[[7, 4]]`, `new_segment=[]`, `max_segment=[5, 3]`
7. `i=6`: `new_segment=[5, 6]`, `max_segment=[5, 3]`

At the end of the loop:
- `new_segment` will be `[5, 6]` because the last element is non-negative.
- `max_segment` will be `[5, 3]` because it's the highest sum segment encountered.
- `segments_variants` will be `[[3, 1], [7, 4]]` because these are the segments completed by negative numbers.
- `max_sum` remains -1 as it is not modified in the loop.

Output State: **arr is a list of integers; new_segment is [5, 6]; max_segment is [5, 3]; segments_variants is [[3, 1], [7, 4]]; max_sum is -1.**
