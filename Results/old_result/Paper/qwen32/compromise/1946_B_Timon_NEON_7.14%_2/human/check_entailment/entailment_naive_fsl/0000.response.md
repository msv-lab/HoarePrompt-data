Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). While this is a necessary operation, it is not sufficient to solve the problem.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function seems to be trying to find the maximum sum subarray (similar to Kadane's algorithm), but it doesn't correctly handle all edge cases and doesn't return a meaningful value for the problem at hand.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation. It simply initializes a variable `answer` to 0 and then does nothing.

2. **Lack of Main Logic**:
   - The main logic to perform the described operations (inserting the sum of a subarray into the array) is completely missing. The problem requires performing exactly `k` operations to maximize the sum of the array, and this logic is not present in the provided code.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle negative numbers, zero, or very large numbers effectively. For example, if all numbers in the array are negative, the code should handle this scenario correctly.
   - The code does not account for the possibility of an empty subarray being the optimal choice for insertion.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - While the modulo operation is correctly implemented in `func_1`, it is not applied consistently throughout the code. The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but this is not ensured in the provided code.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```
The expected output is `96`. However, the provided code does not perform the necessary operations to achieve this result. The code does not even attempt to insert the sum of subarrays into the array, so it cannot produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
Given the incomplete and incorrect implementation, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
