The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state of `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists and the precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` and `v` are integers read from input.**
