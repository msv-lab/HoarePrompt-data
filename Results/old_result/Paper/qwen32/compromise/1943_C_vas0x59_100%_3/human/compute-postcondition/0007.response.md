The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, the list at index `v` initially contains the element `u`, and all other lists are empty. After appending `u` to the list at index `v`, the list at index `v` will contain `u` twice.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains the elements `u` and `u`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is an integer read from input minus 1; `v` is an integer read from input minus 1.**
