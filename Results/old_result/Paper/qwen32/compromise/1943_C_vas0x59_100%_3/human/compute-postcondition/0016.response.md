Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains the elements `u`, `u`, and `u`, the list at index `u` contains the elements `u`, `u`, and `v`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is the first integer read from input minus 3; `v` is the second integer read from input minus 2; `u` and `v` are the integers read from input.**

In simpler terms, the value of `u` has been decreased by 1, while `v` and the structure of `u2vs` remain unchanged.
