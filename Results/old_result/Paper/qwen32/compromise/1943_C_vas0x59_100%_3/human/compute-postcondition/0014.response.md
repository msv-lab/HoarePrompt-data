The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. Since the loop head does not contain any variables that we can adjust directly, the state of `u2vs`, `u`, `v`, and `n` must remain as they are for the loop to determine whether it can execute again.

The loop will continue to execute as long as the range `(n - 1)` has not been fully iterated over. Given that the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, we don't need to adjust its state. Instead, we need to ensure that the loop counter is incremented correctly, which is managed internally by the `for` loop construct.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains the elements `u`, `u`, and `u`, the list at index `u` contains the elements `u`, `u`, and `v`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is the first integer read from input minus 2; `v` is the second integer read from input minus 2**
