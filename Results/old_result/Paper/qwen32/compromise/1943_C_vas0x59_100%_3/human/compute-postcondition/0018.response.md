The code appends the value `v` to the list at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. 

Given the initial state, the list at index `u` contains the elements `[u, u, v]`. After appending `v` to this list, the list at index `u` will now contain the elements `[u, u, v, v]`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains the elements `u`, `u`, and `u`, the list at index `u` contains the elements `u`, `u`, `v`, `v`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is the first integer read from input minus 3; `v` is the second integer read from input minus 3.**
