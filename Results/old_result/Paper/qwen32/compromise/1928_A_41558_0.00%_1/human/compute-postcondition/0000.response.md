The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range and that for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers within a certain range. The execution of the provided code does not affect `t`, `a`, or `b`; it only introduces a new variable `n` which is assigned the value of the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
