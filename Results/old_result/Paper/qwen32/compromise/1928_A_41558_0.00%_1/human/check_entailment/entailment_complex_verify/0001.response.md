### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies a key issue with the provided program: the use of floating-point division (`/`) instead of integer division (`//`). This can lead to incorrect results due to precision issues when checking if one dimension is exactly half of the other.

Let's break down the program and the annotations to confirm the issues and verify the original assessment:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic:**
   - **Condition 1:** The program first checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to form a new rectangle from two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
     ```python
     if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
         print('NO')
     ```
     This condition is correct. If both `a` and `b` are odd, no valid cuts can be made to form new rectangles with integer sides.
   
   - **Condition 2:** The program then checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original rectangle when rearranged.
     ```python
     elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
         print('NO')
     ```
     This condition is incorrect due to the use of floating-point division (`/`). It should use integer division (`//`) to ensure that the division results in an exact integer.
   
   - **Default Case:** If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to form a new rectangle.
     ```python
     else:
         print('YES')
     ```
     This condition is correct under the assumption that the previous conditions are correctly implemented.

### Corrected Logic

The corrected logic should be:

- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "NO".
- If `a % 2 == 0` and `a // 2 != b`, or if `b % 2 == 0` and `b // 2 != a`, print "YES".
- Otherwise, print "NO".

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a // 2 == b or b // 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the use of floating-point division. The provided program is indeed incorrect due to this flaw. The corrected version of the program, which uses integer division, will correctly determine whether Bob can form a new rectangle from the given rectangle.

**Final: False**
