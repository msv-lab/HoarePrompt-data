The code sets `a` and `b` to `float('inf')`. This means that `a` and `b` are no longer the smallest and second smallest values in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is the count of values in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`; `n` is an input integer.**
