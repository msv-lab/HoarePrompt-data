For the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state before the loop starts. The loop is controlled by the variable `_` in the loop head, which is used to iterate over the range of an integer input representing the number of test cases `t`. 

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
2. The loop will execute if and only if the integer input (representing the number of test cases `t`) is greater than 0.
3. The state before the loop starts includes `t` (the number of test cases) and the array `a` for each test case. However, only `t` is directly involved in the loop head.
4. The array `a` and its elements are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted in the state before the loop starts to ensure the loop executes.

Given this, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
