Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than `x + 1`; `x` is `x + 1`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the previous value of `b` and `b` is the previous value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values; `b` is `l[x]`.**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to be the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The values of `l`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and the condition involving `a` and `b` remain unchanged except for the new value assigned to `b`.
