Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is the second smallest unique element in the list `l`.
- `b` is the smallest unique element in the list `l`.
- `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are larger than both `a` and `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(c)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Identify `b` and `a`**:
   - `b` is the smallest unique element in the list `l`.
   - `a` is the second smallest unique element in the list `l`.

2. **Calculate `c`**:
   - `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are larger than both `a` and `b`.
   - Since `a` is the second smallest unique element, any element larger than `a` will automatically be larger than `b` (because `b` is smaller than `a`).

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which is the count of elements in `l` that are larger than both `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the count of elements in the list `l` that are larger than both the smallest unique element (`b`) and the second smallest unique element (`a`).

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in the list `l` that are larger than both the smallest unique element `b` and the second smallest unique element `a`)**
