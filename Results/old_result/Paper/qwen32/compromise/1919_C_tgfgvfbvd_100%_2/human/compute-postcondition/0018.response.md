Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `a` remains `float('inf')`, and if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated to `l[x]`, and `a` remains `float('inf)`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is set to `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.**
