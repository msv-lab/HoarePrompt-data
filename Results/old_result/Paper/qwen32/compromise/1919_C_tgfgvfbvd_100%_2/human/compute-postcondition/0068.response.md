The code snippet `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b`, and the value of `b` becomes the previous value of `a`. 

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the previous value of `a`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `x + 1`.**
