The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. Since `c` was initially 0, after the increment, `c` becomes 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the element at index `x` in `l`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 1.**
