The value of `a` is updated to `l[x]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged. Since `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` and `a` was initially `float('inf')`, `a` now holds the value of `l[x]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0.**
