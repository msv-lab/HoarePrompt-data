Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` and `b` are either `float('inf')` or the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.**
