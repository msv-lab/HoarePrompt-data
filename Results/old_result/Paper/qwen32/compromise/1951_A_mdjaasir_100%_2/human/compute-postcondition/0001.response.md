The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `start` and `end` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they are part of the state before the loop starts.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust it before the loop starts.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
