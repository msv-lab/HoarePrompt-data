The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`. The other variables (`sm`, `over_sum`, and the elements of `lst`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is 0
- `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`
- `i` is `l + 1`
- `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`
- `sm` is greater than `over_sum`

After the code `r, l = [i, j]` is executed:
- `r` is updated to the value of `i`
- `l` is updated to the value of `j`
- `i` and `j` are not mentioned to be changed, so they retain their initial values
- `sm` and `over_sum` remain unchanged
- The condition `l + 2 <= len(lst)` and the relationship `i = l + 1` are still valid if `j` is such that the condition holds after the update

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `i` is `l + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `l + 2 <= len(lst)`**
