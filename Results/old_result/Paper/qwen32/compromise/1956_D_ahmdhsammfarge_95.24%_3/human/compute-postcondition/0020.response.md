The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `lst`. If `i` is less than the length of `lst`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index `j` that maximizes `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. The state of `r` and `l` does not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`r` is 0, `l` is the index `j` that maximizes `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`, `i` is `l + 1`**
