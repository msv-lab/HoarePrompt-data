The code snippet `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to a new variable `over_sum`. The values of `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`r` is `l + 1`, `l` is `l + 3`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is `l + 3`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**

In simpler terms, `over_sum` now holds the same value as `sm`, which is the sum of elements in `lst` from the start up to (but not including) index `i`, plus the sum of elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst`, plus the count of elements from index `i` to `j` inclusive.
