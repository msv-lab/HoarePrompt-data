The value of `sm` is recalculated using the new formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. The values of `r`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The new value of `sm` depends on the updated calculation involving the square of `(j - i + 1)`.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**
