The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust only the state of `j` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `r` is the value of `l + 1`
- `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations
- `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`
- `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`
- If `sm > over_sum`, then `r` is updated to the value of `i` and `l` is updated to the value of `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `over_sum` retain their original values.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`** becomes:
State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is incremented by 1 (so `j` is now `j + 1`), and `j` is less than `len(lst)`**

To be more precise, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is `x + 1`, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`**

Since the exact value of `j` (denoted as `x`) is not specified, we can generalize it as:

State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`**

However, to be more specific in the context of the loop head:

State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`**
