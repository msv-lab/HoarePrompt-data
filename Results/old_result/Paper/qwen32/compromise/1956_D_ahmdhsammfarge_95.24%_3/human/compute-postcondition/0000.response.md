The code appends a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and the condition `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)` still holds true. The `ops` list now contains the newly added list `[r + 1, l + 1]` along with any previous elements it might have had.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers, with the additional element `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it.**
