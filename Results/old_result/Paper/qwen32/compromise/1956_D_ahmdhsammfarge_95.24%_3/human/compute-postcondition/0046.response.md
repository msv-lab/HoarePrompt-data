The code calculates the value of `sm` based on the given expression and updates the variable `sm` with this new value. The other variables (`r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `lst`) retain their initial states unless directly modified by the code snippet, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.**
