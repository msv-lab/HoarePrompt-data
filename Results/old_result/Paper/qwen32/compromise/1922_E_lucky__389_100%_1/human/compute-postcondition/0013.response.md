Output State: **The input consists of a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, where `t` is equal to `x`. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required for that test case. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. `i` is 3. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 2.**

In natural language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
