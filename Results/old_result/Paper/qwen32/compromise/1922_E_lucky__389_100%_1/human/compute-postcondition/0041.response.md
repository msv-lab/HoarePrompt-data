The given code snippet simply sets the variable `i` to 0. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `t` remains equal to `x`, `x` remains not equal to 0, and the values of `subseq_lens` and `mx` remain unchanged. The only change is that `i` is set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is equal to `x`, `x` is not equal to 0, `i` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the value 1, and `mx` is at least 1.**
