The value of `x` is decreased by `2 ** (i - 1)`, which is `2 ** (2 - 1)` or `2 ** 1`, which equals `2`. Therefore, `x` is now `x - 2`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is equal to `x - 2`, `x` is not equal to 0, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` contains the value 1.**
