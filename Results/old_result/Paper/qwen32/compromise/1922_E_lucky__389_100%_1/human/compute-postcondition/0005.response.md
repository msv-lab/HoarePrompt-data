The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `0`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `X`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, `x`), but none of these are used in the `print(0)` statement.
- The `print(0)` statement directly outputs the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
