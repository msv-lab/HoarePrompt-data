### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to simulate the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid with characters '<' and '>', and to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The program uses two main arrays, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements of the pinball when it encounters '>' and '<' characters, respectively.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Processing '>' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` to process '>' characters.
   - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative movement and stores it in the array `A`.
   - It also keeps track of the indices of '>' characters in the array `idx_A`.

3. **Processing '<' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` in reverse to process '<' characters.
   - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative movement and stores it in the array `B`.
   - It also keeps track of the indices of '<' characters in the array `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Pinball Movement:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the current positions in arrays `A` and `B`, respectively.
   - For each cell in the grid, it determines whether the pinball starts moving to the right ('>') or to the left ('<').
   - Depending on the direction, it calculates the total movement time using the values in arrays `A` and `B`.
   - It prints the total movement time for each starting position.

### Evaluation Against Example:

Let's evaluate the program against the first test case provided in the example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  3
  ><<
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  3 6 5
  ```

- **Program Execution:**
  - For the first test case, `s = "><<"`.
  - Processing '>' characters:
    - `A = [0]`, `idx_A = [0]` (initialization)
    - At index 0, `s[0] = '>'`, so `A = [0, 1]`, `idx_A = [0, 0]`
  - Processing '<' characters in reverse:
    - `B = [0]`, `idx_B = [2]` (initialization)
    - At index 2, `s[2] = '<'`, so `B = [0, 1]`, `idx_B = [2, 2]`
    - At index 1, `s[1] = '<'`, so `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 2, 1]`
  - Calculating pinball movement:
    - For `i = 0` (starting at the first cell):
      - `s[0] = '>'`, so it uses the values in `A` and `B` to calculate the movement time as 3.
    - For `i = 1` (starting at the second cell):
      - `s[1] = '<'`, so it uses the values in `A` and `B` to calculate the movement time as 6.
    - For `i = 2` (starting at the third cell):
      - `s[2] = '<'`, so it uses the values in `A` and `B` to calculate the movement time as 5.

The program produces the correct output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly simulate the pinball movement and calculate the required times based on the given logic and example. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
