Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- The list `b` is defined as:
  \[
  b = \left[0, 0, (2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > r\_result + 1000000000.0 \text{ else } 1), (2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > additional\_element - 2000000000.0 \text{ else } 1)\right]
  \]

- `u` is set to 0.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.

### Analysis of List `b`:
- The first two elements of `b` are explicitly 0.
- The third element of `b` is determined by the condition:
  \[
  2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > r\_result + 1000000000.0 \text{ else } 1
  \]
  Simplifying the condition:
  \[
  2000000000.0 - r\_result > r\_result + 1000000000.0 \implies 1000000000.0 > 2r\_result \implies r\_result < 500000000.0
  \]
  So, if \( r\_result < 500000000.0 \), the third element is \( 2000000000.0 - r\_result \). Otherwise, it is 1.

- The fourth element of `b` is determined by the condition:
  \[
  2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > additional\_element - 2000000000.0 \text{ else } 1
  \]
  Simplifying the condition:
  \[
  2000000000.0 - r\_result > additional\_element - 2000000000.0 \implies 4000000000.0 - r\_result > additional\_element \implies additional\_element < 4000000000.0 - r\_result
  \]
  So, if \( additional\_element < 4000000000.0 - r\_result \), the fourth element is \( 2000000000.0 - r\_result \). Otherwise, it is 1.

### Print Statement Analysis:
- The print statement is:
  \[
  print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
  \]
- We need to determine the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`.

### Determining Indices:
- Since `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, let's assume `c` and `d` are integers between 1 and 2 (since `b` only has 4 elements).
- If `c` is 1, then `c * 2 - 1` is 1, which corresponds to the second element of `b`, which is 0.
- If `c` is 2, then `c * 2 - 1` is 3, which corresponds to the third element of `b`.
- Similarly, if `d` is 1, then `d * 2 - 1` is 1, which corresponds to the second element of `b`, which is 0.
- If `d` is 2, then `d * 2 - 1` is 3, which corresponds to the third element of `b`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If both `c` and `d` are 1:**
   \[
   b[1] - b[1] = 0 - 0 = 0
   \]

2. **If `c` is 1 and `d` is 2:**
   \[
   b[1] - b[3] = 0 - (2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > r\_result + 1000000000.0 \text{ else } 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   0 - (2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } r\_result < 500000000.0 \text{ else } 1)
   \]

3. **If `c` is 2 and `d` is 1:**
   \[
   b[3] - b[1] = (2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > r\_result + 1000000000.0 \text{ else } 1) - 0
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   (2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } r\_result < 500000000.0 \text{ else } 1)
   \]

4. **If both `c` and `d` are 2:**
   \[
   b[3] - b[3] = (2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > r\_result + 1000000000.0 \text{ else } 1) - (2000000000.0 - r\_result \text{ if } 2000000000.0 - r\_result > r\_result + 1000000000.0 \text{ else } 1) = 0
   \]

### Conclusion:
Given the possible scenarios, the output depends on the values of `c` and `d` and the value of `r_result`. However, without specific values for `c`, `d`, and `r_result`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **0 if both `c` and `d` are 1 or both `c` and `d` are 2, otherwise it depends on the value of `r_result` and `additional_element`**.
