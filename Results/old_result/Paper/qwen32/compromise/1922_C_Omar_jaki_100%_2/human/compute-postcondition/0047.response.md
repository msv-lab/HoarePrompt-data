To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])` generates tuples `(w, x, y, z)` where:
- `w` comes from `a`
- `x` comes from `a[1:]`
- `y` comes from `a[2:]`
- `z` comes from `a[3:]`

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is `(-1000000000.0, r_result, 2000000000.0, additional_element)`
- `b` is `[0, 0, (v if v > x - w else 1), (v if v > z - y else 1)]`
- `v` is `y - x`
- `u` is `0`
- `t` is `False`
- `r()` has been called

Let's analyze the previous iteration:
- In the previous iteration, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were assigned values from `a`.
- Specifically, `w` was `-1000000000.0`, `x` was `r_result`, `y` was `2000000000.0`, and `z` was `additional_element`.

For the next iteration, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be:
- `w` will be `r_result`
- `x` will be `2000000000.0`
- `y` will be `additional_element`
- `z` will be the next element in `a` after `additional_element`, but since `a` only has four elements, there is no next element.

Therefore, the loop cannot execute another iteration because there are no more elements to form a tuple `(w, x, y, z)` from `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]`.

However, if we assume that the list `a` could potentially have more elements, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `w` is `r_result`
- `x` is `2000000000.0`
- `y` is `additional_element`
- `z` is the next element in `a` (which does not exist in this case, but hypothetically it would be the next element if `a` had more elements)

Since the loop cannot execute another iteration based on the given `a`, the state remains as it is with the understanding that the loop terminates.

State: **`[0, 0, S_1, S_1, S_2, S_2, ..., S_{n-2}, S_{n-2}]; u is 0; t is False; r() has been called; a is (-1000000000.0, r_result, 2000000000.0, additional_element); b is [0, 0, (v if v > x - w else 1), (v if v > z - y else 1)]; v is y - x`**
