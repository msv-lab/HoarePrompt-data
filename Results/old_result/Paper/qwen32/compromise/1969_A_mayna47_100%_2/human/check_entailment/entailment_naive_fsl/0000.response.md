Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, then sending invitations to just those two friends will be sufficient. However, this assumption is not always correct.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends, and friends 3 and 4 are each other's best friends. The program will print 3 because it does not find a single pair that can be invited to satisfy the condition. However, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2, or friends 3 and 4, to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program needs to consider all possible pairs and groups of friends to determine the minimum number of invitations required. The current implementation does not handle this correctly and can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.
