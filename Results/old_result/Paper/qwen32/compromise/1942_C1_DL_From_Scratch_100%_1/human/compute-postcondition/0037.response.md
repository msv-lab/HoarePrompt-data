The code snippet increments the value of `count` by 1. The values of `x`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `x` must be at least `i + 2` and `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` still holds.

Output State: **`x` must be at least `i + 2`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, `count` is `count + 1`, `i` is unchanged.**
