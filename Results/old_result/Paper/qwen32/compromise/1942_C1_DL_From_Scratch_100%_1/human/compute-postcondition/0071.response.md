Postcondition: **`list0` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`. If `num` is equal to 1, `count` is 3. `T` is decremented by 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `x` is an integer read from the input, `y` is an integer read from the input. If `num` is not equal to 1, the values of `count`, `T`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
