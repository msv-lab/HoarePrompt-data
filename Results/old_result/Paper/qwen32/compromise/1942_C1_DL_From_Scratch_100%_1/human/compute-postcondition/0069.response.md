Postcondition: **`list0` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1` and `num` is equal to 1, `count` is the total number of times `num` was equal to 1 during the loop plus one, `T` is decremented by 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `x` is an integer read from the input, `y` is an integer read from the input.**
