The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `num` based on the formula `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`. This calculation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `num`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `y` is the third integer read from the input, The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `list0` is a list containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` sorted in ascending order; `i` is `x - 1`, `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1, where `num` is calculated as `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` for each `i` from 0 to `x - 2`; `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.**
