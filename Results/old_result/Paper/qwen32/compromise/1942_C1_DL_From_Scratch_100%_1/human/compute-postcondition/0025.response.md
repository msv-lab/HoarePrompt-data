The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `T` times. The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `T` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given that the loop will run `T` times and we are at the end of the previous iteration, `T` must have been decremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `T` should be one more than its current value.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `x` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 2; `y` is the third integer read from the input; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `list0` is a list containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` sorted in ascending order; `i` is `x - 1`; `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1, plus 1 if the current value of `num` is 1; `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
