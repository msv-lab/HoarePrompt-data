Postcondition: **`list0` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `list0[x - 1] - list0[x - 2] - 1`, `T` is decremented by 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer read from the input. If `num` equals 1, `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
