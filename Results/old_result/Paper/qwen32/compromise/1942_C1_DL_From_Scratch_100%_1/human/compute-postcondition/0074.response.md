Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), and an integer `y` which is always 0. It also receives a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices chosen by Bessie. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
