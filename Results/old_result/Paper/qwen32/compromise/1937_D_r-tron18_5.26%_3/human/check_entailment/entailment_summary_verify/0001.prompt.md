You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It calculates and returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is a value derived from the positions of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and the implementation of the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Analysis of the Problem

The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the cell and then inverts the direction of the cell. We need to determine how long it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Analysis of the Program

The program seems to be attempting to solve the problem using a more complex and optimized approach rather than simulating each pinball movement individually. Let's break down the key components:

1. **Function `func_1(arr, times)`**:
   - This function seems to be calculating a difference between elements of a list `arr` based on the `times` parameter.
   - It uses the `max` function to ensure the index is not out of bounds, which is likely used to handle edge cases.

2. **Function `func_2(s1, n)`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
   - It maintains two lists: `pre` (for positions of '>') and `suffZero` (cumulative positions of '<').
   - It uses the `accumulate` function to create a prefix sum array for `pre`.
   - For each position in the grid, it calculates the time to leave the grid based on the number of '>' and '<' characters left to process.
   - The calculations involve using `func_1` to get specific differences in the prefix and suffix sums.

### Correctness Check

The program's logic is quite intricate and relies on maintaining accurate prefix and suffix sums to compute the time efficiently. However, the implementation details are not straightforward and could easily contain bugs if not thoroughly tested.

The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior, but this alone is not sufficient to prove correctness for all possible inputs. The program's logic appears to be trying to avoid simulating each pinball movement, which is computationally expensive for large inputs.

Given the complexity of the logic and the potential for off-by-one errors or incorrect handling of edge cases, it is challenging to definitively prove correctness without extensive testing.

### Conclusion

While the program might work for the provided example, the complexity and lack of detailed comments or intermediate checks make it difficult to assert its correctness for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**

This conclusion is based on the complexity of the logic and the potential for errors in handling all edge cases and input scenarios. Further testing and validation would be required to conclusively determine correctness.
