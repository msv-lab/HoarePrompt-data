The code snippet creates a list `pre` containing the indices (1-based) of all '>' characters in the string `s1`. The length of the string `s1` remains unchanged, and the string `s1` itself is not modified.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s1`. `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`.**
