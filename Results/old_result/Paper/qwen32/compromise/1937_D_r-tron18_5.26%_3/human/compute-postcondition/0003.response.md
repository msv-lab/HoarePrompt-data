The code snippet only initializes a new list `suffZero` with a single element `0`. None of the other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s1`, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, with `preOne[0]` being 0, `suffZero` is `[0]`.**
