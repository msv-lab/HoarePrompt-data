The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list depending on the value of `i`. Specifically, it appends 'A' if `i % 2` is 1 and 'B' if `i % 2` is 0. After the append operation, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, `pattern` initially contains either ['A', 'B'] or ['B', 'A'] with an additional 'A' or 'B' appended, and `i` is incremented by 1 after the append operation. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that \(0 < t \leq 50\); `n` must be greater than 2 * (`i + 1`); `pattern` is a list containing either ['A', 'B', 'A'], ['A', 'B', 'B'], ['B', 'A', 'A'], or ['B', 'A', 'B'] depending on the initial value of `i`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
