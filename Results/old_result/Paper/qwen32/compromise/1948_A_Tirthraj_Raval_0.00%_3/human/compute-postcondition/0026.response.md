The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only determine that the last element of `pattern` will be either 'A' or 'B'. The other variables (`t`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 49; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `pattern` is a list with the last element being either 'A' or 'B'**.
