The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop condition, the only state we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. Since the loop runs `t` times, at the start of each new iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 until it reaches 0, at which point the loop will stop.

Given that the loop is about to execute one more time, we need to decrement `t` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 49; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, nothing additional happens to `pattern`. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing `n` characters, alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A' if `n // 2` is odd and starting with 'B' if `n // 2` is even.**
