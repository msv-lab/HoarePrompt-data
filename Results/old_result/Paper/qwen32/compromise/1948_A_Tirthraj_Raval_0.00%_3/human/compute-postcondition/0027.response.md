The code appends an element to the `pattern` list based on the expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`. Here, `i` is not defined in the initial state, but we can infer that `i` must be an integer for the expression to make sense. The expression `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]` evaluates to either 'A' or 'B'. 

Given the bitwise XOR operation (`^`), the expression simplifies as follows:
- If `i % 2` is 0, then `i % 2 ^ 1` is 1, and `'AB'[1]` is 'B'.
- If `i % 2` is 1, then `i % 2 ^ 1` is 0, and `'AB'[0]` is 'A'.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only determine that the last element of `pattern` will be either 'A' or 'B'. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 49; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `pattern` is a list with the last element being either 'A' or 'B'**
