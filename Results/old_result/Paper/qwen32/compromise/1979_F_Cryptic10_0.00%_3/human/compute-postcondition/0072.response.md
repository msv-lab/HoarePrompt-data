Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `d` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, then the conditions mentioned above hold without any additional changes from the if part. Otherwise, the conditions mentioned above also hold without any changes from the else part since there is no else part to modify the variables.**
