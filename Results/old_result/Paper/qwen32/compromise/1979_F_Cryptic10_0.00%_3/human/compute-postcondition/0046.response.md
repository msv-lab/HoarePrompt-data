Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, and now also includes `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and `v` is no longer in the set; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is 0, the conditions remain as described. If `v` is not 0, there is no change to the described conditions.**

In natural language: The output state is that `n` remains a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph. The `path` list now includes the vertex `v` if it was in `remaining_vertices`. The `remaining_vertices` set no longer contains the vertex `v`. The values of `v` and `u` are still the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and `d` is now `d - 1`. If `v` was 0, the conditions remain unchanged. If `v` was not 0, the conditions also remain unchanged.
