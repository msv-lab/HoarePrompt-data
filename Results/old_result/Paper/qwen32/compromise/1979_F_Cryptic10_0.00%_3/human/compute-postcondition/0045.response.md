The code appends the value of `v` to the `path` list. This means the `path` list will now contain one more element, which is `v`. The other variables (`n`, `remaining_vertices`, `u`, and `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, and now also includes `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in the set; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is 0, the conditions remain as described. If `v` is not 0, there is no change to the described conditions.**
