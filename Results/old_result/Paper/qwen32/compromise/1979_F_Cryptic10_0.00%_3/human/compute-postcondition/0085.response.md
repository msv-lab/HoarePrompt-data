To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the conditions and operations within the loop. The loop iterates from `d = n - 1` down to `d = 0`. For each iteration, it checks if `v` (obtained from `func_1(d)`) is in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it appends `v` to `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`, then breaks out of the loop. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the loop will terminate either when `v` is found in `remaining_vertices` (and hence added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`), or when `d` reaches `0` and no `v` from `func_1(d)` was found in `remaining_vertices`.

The final output state depends on whether `v` was found in `remaining_vertices` at any point during the loop execution:
1. If `v` was found in `remaining_vertices` at some point, `path` will include that `v` and `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain that `v`. The loop will terminate early.
2. If `v` was never found in `remaining_vertices` throughout the loop, `path` and `remaining_vertices` will remain unchanged from their last state before the loop terminated at `d = 0`.

Since the problem does not specify that `v` will always be found in `remaining_vertices`, we must consider the possibility that the loop completes all iterations without finding `v` in `remaining_vertices`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, with no changes if `v` was never found in `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices` contains the same vertices as it did after the last iteration of the loop, with no changes if `v` was never found in `remaining_vertices`.**

In simpler terms, if `v` was never found in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, `path` and `remaining_vertices` will remain as they were at the start of the loop. If `v` was found and added to `path`, `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain that `v`.
