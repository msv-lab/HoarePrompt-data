The given code snippet involves calling a function `func_1(d)` and unpacking its return value into the variables `v` and `u`. Since the function `func_1` and its behavior with respect to the input `d` are not defined, we cannot determine the specific values of `v` and `u` directly. However, we can state that `v` and `u` will hold the values returned by `func_1(d)`.

The initial state specifies that:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is a list containing one element, which is a vertex from the set of remaining vertices.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex.

Since the function call does not affect `n`, `path`, or `remaining_vertices`, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is the introduction of the variables `v` and `u` which are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing one element, which is a vertex from the set of remaining vertices; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
