The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `remaining_vertices` is non-empty. If `remaining_vertices` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all the original vertices except those that were added to `path`. For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex**
