Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n. If `v` is 0, the current value of `v` remains 0.**
