The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables; it merely alters the control flow by moving to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `d` is `d + 1`
- `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`

The `continue` statement does not modify the values of `d`, `v`, or `u`. It only affects the loop control, not the variables themselves.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`d` is `d + 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**
