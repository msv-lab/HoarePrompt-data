The `break` statement will exit the current loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the value of `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` and the current value of `v`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, then the current value of `v` remains 0. The current value of `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` after the code execution, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
