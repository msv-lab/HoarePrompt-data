The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is simply `print('Alice')`. This means that the string `'Alice'` will be printed to the console, regardless of the values of the other variables (`N`, `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, `cw`) mentioned in the initial state.

Since the string `'Alice'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement, there is no need to substitute or describe any variable values. The output will be exactly the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
