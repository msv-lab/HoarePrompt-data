Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `case`, which is a tuple. The first element of the tuple is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The function returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters in the string is odd; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
