The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `arr`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The code does not affect `t` or `n`, but it changes the list `a` to `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
