Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` have been updated based on the bits of `c`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` have been updated based on the bits of `c`, `i` is 3, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `arr[2].bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[3]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.**
