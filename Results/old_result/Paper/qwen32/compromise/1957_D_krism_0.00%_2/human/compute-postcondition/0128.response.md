Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` have been updated based on the bits of `c`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` have been updated based on the bits of `c`, `i` is 2, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 32, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` + (`pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`), `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `arr[1].bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[2]`.** 

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed for all 32 iterations, the variable `j` will be 32, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `pre` and `suf` will have been updated based on the bits of `c` (which is `prefix[2]`). The other variables such as `t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `i`, `cur`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states or states after the first few iterations as described. The `ans` variable will have been calculated based on the final state of `pre` and `suf` lists.
