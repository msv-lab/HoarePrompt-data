For the provided task, the for loop iterates over each element `v` in the list `arr`. The only variable in the loop head is `v`, and `arr` is already defined in the state before the loop starts.

To ensure that the loop executes, `arr` must contain at least one element. Given that `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 10^5`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 based on the problem statement, no adjustment to `n` is necessary. The variable `v` is just an iterator and does not need an initial state since it is assigned by the loop.

Thus, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute, as long as `arr` has at least one element, which is already ensured by the condition `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list containing a single element, `0`.**
