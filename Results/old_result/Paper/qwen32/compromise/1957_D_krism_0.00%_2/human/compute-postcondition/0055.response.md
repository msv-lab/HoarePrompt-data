The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `30`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `29`. The variables `n` and the range function parameters do not need to be adjusted because they determine the starting point of the loop and the direction of iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except for each `j` in range(32), `suf[j][1]` is 1 if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is 1, `i` is 29, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, and `j` is 32**
