Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns some output based on the values of `n` and `a`. The specific output is not detailed here, but it is implied that the function performs a computation or check on the list `a` for each test case.**
