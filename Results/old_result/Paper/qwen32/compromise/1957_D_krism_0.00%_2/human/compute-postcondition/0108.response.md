To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop statement and the variables involved in the loop head.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(32):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value. The `range(32)` function will generate values from 0 to 31, which means the loop will definitely execute as long as `j` is initialized to a value that is less than 32.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9
- `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`
- `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` have been updated based on the bits of `c`
- `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` have been updated based on the bits of `c`
- `i` is 2
- `cur` is `prefix[0]`
- `j` is 32
- `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` + (`pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`)
- `y` is `arr[1]`
- `k` is `arr[1].bit_length() - 1`
- `c` is `prefix[2]`

The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`. Since `j` is currently 32, the loop will not execute because the range function `range(32)` will start from 0 and go up to 31, not including 32. Therefore, `j` should be initialized to a value less than 32 for the loop to execute.
