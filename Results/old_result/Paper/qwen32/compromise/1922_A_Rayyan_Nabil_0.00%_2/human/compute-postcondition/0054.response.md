Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a value based on the comparison or relationship between the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.**
