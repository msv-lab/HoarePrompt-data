To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the logic governing the variable `l`:

1. **Variables and Initial State**:
    - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
    - `i` is set to `n`, where `n` is greater than 0.
    - `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings that are newly input.
    - `l` is set to 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. Otherwise, `l` is set to 'NO'.

2. **Logic to Determine `l`**:
    - The variable `l` is determined based on a condition that checks each character at the same index in strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    - If there is at least one position `i` where the characters in `a` and `c` are different (`a[i] != c[i]`) and the characters in `b` and `c` are different (`b[i] != c[i]`), then `l` is set to 'YES'.
    - If no such position exists, `l` is set to 'NO'.

3. **Output of `print(l)`**:
    - The `print(l)` statement will output the value of `l` based on the above condition.
    - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `l` (either 'YES' or 'NO') without those strings.
    - However, we can describe the output based on the given logic.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO')**
