The code snippet sets the variable `l` to the string `'YES'`. This assignment overrides any previous value that `l` might have had, including the conditionally assigned value based on the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a newly input string, `b` is a newly input string, `c` is a newly input string, and `l` is 'YES'.**
