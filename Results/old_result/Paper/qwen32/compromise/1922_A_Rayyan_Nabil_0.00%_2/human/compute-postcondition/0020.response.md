The code snippet `n = int(input())` will reassign the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `n` + 1, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user, and `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**
