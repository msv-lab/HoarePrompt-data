The code snippet assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `l`, regardless of its previous value. This means that the value of `l` is now `'YES'`, and it does not depend on the conditions specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `n` is a newly input integer that must be at least 1, `a` is the newly input string, `b` is the newly input string, `c` is the newly input string, and `l` is 'YES'.**
