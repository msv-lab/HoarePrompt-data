Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, the first element of `l` is 2, and the second element of `l` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `j`, `i`, `n`, and `l` do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
