Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `j` is initialized to 0.
- `l[i]` (which is `l[0]`) equals `i + 2` (which is `0 + 2 = 2`).
- `l[i + 1]` (which is `l[1]`) equals `i + 1` (which is `0 + 1 = 1`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(2)` statement directly prints the integer `2`. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, or `j`. The values of these variables are provided for the context but are not used in the print statement.

### Output:
Based on the code snippet, the output will be the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
