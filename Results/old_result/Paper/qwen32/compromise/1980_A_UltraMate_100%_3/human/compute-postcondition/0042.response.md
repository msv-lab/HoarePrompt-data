Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is an input string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of characters in `s`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `2 * m`; otherwise, `ans` remains `0`. `i` is the next character in `'ABCDEFG'` after the previous `i`.**
