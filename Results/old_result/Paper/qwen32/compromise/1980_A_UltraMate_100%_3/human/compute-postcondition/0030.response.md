For the given task, we need to adjust the state based on the loop head of the provided `for` loop. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation condition. Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`

Given the loop:
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`, `t` is decremented by 1**
