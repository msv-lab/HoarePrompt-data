The code snippet creates a `Counter` object `hmp` from the string `s`. This `Counter` will hold the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

Given the initial state, the value of `hmp` will be a dictionary-like object where each key is a unique character from `s` and the corresponding value is the number of times that character appears in `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string provided by the user input, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`.**
