The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `pl`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, and `palka` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input; `pl` is an empty list.**
