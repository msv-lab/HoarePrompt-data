The provided Python code snippet is `pl.append(i)`, which appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. 

Given the initial state:
- `w` is `w_initial + n - 1`
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element
- `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` (and now includes `i_next` if `i` was not already in `pl`)
- `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (if `i` existed, it is now `d[i] + 1`; if `i` did not exist, it is now 1); other key-value pairs in `d` are unchanged
- `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`
- `i` is `i_next_next`

The only variable affected by the line `pl.append(i)` is `pl`, which now includes `i` as an additional element. No other variables are directly modified by this line.

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` contains `i` and includes `i_next` if `i` was not already in `pl` (and now includes `i_next_next`), `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (if `i` existed, it is now `d[i] + 1`; if `i` did not exist, it is now 1); other key-value pairs in `d` are unchanged, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, `i` is `i_next_next`.**
