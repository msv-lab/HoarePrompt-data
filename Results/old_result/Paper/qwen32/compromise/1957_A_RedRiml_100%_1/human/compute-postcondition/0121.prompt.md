Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; w is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += d[j] // 3
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: 

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - `w` remains `w_initial + n`.
- `ln` remains the input integer.
- `palka` remains the input list of integers.
- `pl` remains the list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `d` remains the dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values.
- `shapes` will be incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

The final value of `shapes` will be the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers, `pl` is a list of integers, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
