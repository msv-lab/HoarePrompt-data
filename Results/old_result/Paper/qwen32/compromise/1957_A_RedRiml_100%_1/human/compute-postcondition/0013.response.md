The code snippet provided is:
```
pl.append(i)
```

This line of code appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `pl` now includes the value of `i`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only say that `pl` now contains `i` as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that now contains `i` as its last element; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` is updated to have the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, the value of the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` is not in `pl` (except now it is).**
