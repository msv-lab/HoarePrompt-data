The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `pl`. If `pl` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the second element in `pl`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the third element in `pl`.

State: **`w` is `w_initial + n`, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the input list of integers, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values, `j` is the third element in `pl`. If `d[j] >= 3`, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3`.**
