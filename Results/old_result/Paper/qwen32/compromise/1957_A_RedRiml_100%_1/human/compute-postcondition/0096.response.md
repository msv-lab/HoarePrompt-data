The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is now `1`; if `i` was not a key in `d`, it is added with the value `1`.

The other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `shapes`, `w_initial`, `n`, `i_next`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i] = 1` (and other key-value pairs unchanged), `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, `i` is `i_next`**.
