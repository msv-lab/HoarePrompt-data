You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine the number of ships sunk after the Kraken's attacks based on the provided problem description. However, the program contains several issues and hardcoded conditions that do not align with the problem requirements and logic.

1. **Hardcoded Conditions**: The program includes numerous hardcoded conditions that check for specific values of `k` and `n`, and print specific outputs without following the logic described in the problem. These hardcoded conditions are not a general solution and do not handle the full range of possible inputs as described in the problem statement.

2. **Logic for Attacks**: The program attempts to simulate the Kraken's attacks with a loop that runs `k // 2` times, alternating between the first and last ships. However, the loop does not correctly handle the case when `k` is odd, and it does not account for the fact that ships can sink during the attacks, which changes the indices of the remaining ships.

3. **Handling of Ship Sinking**: The program does not correctly handle the sinking of ships, which affects the indices of the remaining ships. After a ship sinks, the indices of the remaining ships change, and the program does not account for this.

4. **Efficiency**: The program uses a loop that runs `k // 2` times, which can be inefficient for large values of `k` (up to \(10^{15}\)). The problem can be solved more efficiently by using mathematical calculations to determine the number of attacks each ship receives without simulating each attack individually.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, when `k` is very large, the program should be able to determine the number of ships sunk without simulating all attacks.

Given these issues, the program is not correct and does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
