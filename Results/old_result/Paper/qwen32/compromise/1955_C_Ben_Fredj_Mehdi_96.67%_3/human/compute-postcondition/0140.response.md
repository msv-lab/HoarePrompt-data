The `print('2')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'2'`. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k` as it directly prints the string `'2'`.

Let's break down the variables mentioned in the initial state to understand the context better:
- `t`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `z`: A constant integer with a value of 1.
- `a`: A list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `n`: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
- `k`: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print('2')` statement.

Output: **2**
