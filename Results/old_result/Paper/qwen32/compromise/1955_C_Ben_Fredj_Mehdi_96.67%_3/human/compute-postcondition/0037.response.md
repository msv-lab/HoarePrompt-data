The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'200'`. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'200'`.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:
- The `print` statement is `print('200')`.
- The string `'200'` is a literal string and does not depend on any variables.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'200'`.

Output: **200**
