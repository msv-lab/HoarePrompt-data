The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'5'`. This statement is independent of the initial state described, which includes variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`. The values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement because it is explicitly printing the string `'5'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('5')`.
2. This statement directly outputs the string `'5'`.
3. The variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are defined in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'5'`.

Output: **5**
