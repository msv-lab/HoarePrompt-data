Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `z` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('8')
```

**Analysis:**
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'8'`.
- The variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet.
- The `print` statement is independent of these variables and directly outputs the character `'8'`.

**Output:**
Since the `print` statement is simply printing the string `'8'`, the output will be the character `'8'`.

Output: **8**
