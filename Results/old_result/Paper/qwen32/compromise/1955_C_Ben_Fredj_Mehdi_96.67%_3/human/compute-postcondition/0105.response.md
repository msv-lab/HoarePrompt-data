Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, and `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space. If `k` equals 4294967295, the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `n` is 2 and `k` is `a[0] - 1` and `a[1] - 2`, the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition. If `k` is equal to 3000000000, the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, the state of the variables remains the same as the precondition. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` remains the same, `z` remains the same, `a` has its first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` non-zero elements decremented by 1, with the specific value at `a[g]` being decremented by 1 if `k` is odd, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `d` points to the last non-zero element, and `g` points to the first non-zero element. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999999, 10000000000000, 199999999999999, 200000000000, 1000000000000, 5999999999, and it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1). Additionally, it is not the case that (n == 101 and k == 100000000000). It is also not the case that (k == 2147483648 and n == 2). It is also not the case that (n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]). It is not the case that (n == 5 and k == 2147483648). It is not the case that (n == 20 and k == 10000000000).**
