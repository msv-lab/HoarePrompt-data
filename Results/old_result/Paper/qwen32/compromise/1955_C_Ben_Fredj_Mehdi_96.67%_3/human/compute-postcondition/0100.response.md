Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `z` remains the same, `a` has its first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` non-zero elements decremented by 1, with the specific value at `a[g]` being decremented by 1 if `k` is odd, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `d` points to the last non-zero element, and `g` points to the first non-zero element.**
