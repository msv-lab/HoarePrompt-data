Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, the program does not modify `a`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, `a[g]` is decremented by `k // 2` times, and `g` and `d` are adjusted if elements become 0. `n` remains unchanged. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is further decremented by 1. Additionally, `d` is adjusted based on how many times `a[d]` became 0, and `g` is adjusted based on how many times `a[g]` became 0.**
