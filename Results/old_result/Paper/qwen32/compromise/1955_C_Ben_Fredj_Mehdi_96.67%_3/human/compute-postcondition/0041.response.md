Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space, `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999999, 10000000000000, 199999999999999, 200000000000, 1000000000000, and it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1). Additionally, it is not the case that (n == 101 and k == 100000000000). It is also not the case that (k == 2147483648 and n == 2)**
