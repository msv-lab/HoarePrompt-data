Let's analyze the given task step by step using the provided initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `z` is set to 2.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces.
- `n` and `k` are no longer relevant in their previous form.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('1')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:
```python
print('1')
```

This statement explicitly prints the string `'1'`. The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this particular print statement because the string to be printed is hardcoded as `'1'`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
