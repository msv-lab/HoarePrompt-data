The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'2'`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'2'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. The variable `z` is set to 1.
3. The variable `a` is a list of integers obtained from new input.
4. The variable `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
5. The variable `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

Despite the presence and values of these variables, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of them. It simply prints the string `'2'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2**
