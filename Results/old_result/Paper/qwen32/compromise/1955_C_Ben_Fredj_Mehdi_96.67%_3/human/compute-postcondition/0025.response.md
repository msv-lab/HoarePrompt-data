The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'10000'`. The initial state provides various conditions and variable definitions, but these do not affect the execution of the `print` statement since it directly outputs a hardcoded string.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('10000')`.
2. This statement will output the string `'10000'` regardless of the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k` as defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'10000'`.

Output: **10000**
