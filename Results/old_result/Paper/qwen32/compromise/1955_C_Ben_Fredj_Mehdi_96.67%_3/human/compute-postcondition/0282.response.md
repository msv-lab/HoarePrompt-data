Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, and `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces. `n` and `k` are no longer relevant in their previous form. If `k` is equal to 1999999999, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is not equal to 99999999999, the following conditions apply: if `n` == 1, `k` == 10000000000000, and `a[0]` == 1, the state remains unchanged. If `k` is equal to 9999999999, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is equal to 101 and `k` is equal to 100000000000, the state remains unchanged. If `k` is equal to 1000000000000, `k` is set to 200000000000. If `k` is equal to 10000000000000, 99999999999999, or 199999999999999, the state of `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is equal to 2147483648, `n` is set to 2, `k` is set to 1000000000, and `a` is set to [1000000000, 1000000000]. If `k` is equal to 5 or 2147483648, `k` is set to 1000000000. If `k` is equal to 20 or 10000000000, `k` is set to 5999999999. If `k` is equal to 4294967295, `k` is set to 2. If `k` is equal to `a[0] - 1`, `a[1] - 2`, or `k` is not equal to 3000000000 and `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of `a`, the state of `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is not equal to 3000000000 and `k` is less than the sum of `a`, the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` is further decremented by 1. `g` is incremented by the number of times the element at index `g` became 0. `d` is decremented by the number of times the element at index `d` became 0. If `k` is equal to 3000000000, the state of `a` remains unchanged.**
