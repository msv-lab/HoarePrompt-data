Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space, `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999999, 10000000000000, 199999999999999, 200000000000, 1000000000000, 5999999999, and it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1). Additionally, it is not the case that (n == 101 and k == 100000000000). It is also not the case that (k == 2147483648 and n == 2). It is also not the case that (n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]). It is not the case that (n == 5 and k == 2147483648). It is not the case that (n == 20 and k == 10000000000), and `k` is not equal to 4294967295. It is not the case that (n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2), and `k` is not equal to 3000000000. Furthermore, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`. `d` is `len(a) - 1`. `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with the first element decremented by 1 and the last element decremented by 1 (if no exception occurs), `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, `k` is an integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and must be at least 2, `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999999, 10000000000000, 199999999999999, 200000000000, 1000000000000, 5999999999, and it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1). Additionally, it is not the case that (n == 101 and k == 100000000000). It is also not the case that (k == 2147483648 and n == 2). It is also not the case that (n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]). It is not the case that (n == 5 and k == 2147483648). It is not the case that (n == 20 and k == 10000000000), and `k` is not equal to 4294967295. It is not the case that (n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2), and `k` is not equal to 3000000000. Furthermore, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`. `d` is `len(a) - 1`, and `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0; otherwise, `g` remains 0. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with the first element decremented by 1 and the last element decremented by 1 (if no exception occurs), `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, `k` is an integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and must be at least 2, `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999999, 10000000000000, 199999999999999, 200000000000, 1000000000000, 5999999999, and it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1). Additionally, it is not the case that (n == 101 and k == 100000000000). It is also not the case that (k == 2147483648 and n == 2). It is also not the case that (n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]). It is not the case that (n == 5 and k == 2147483648). It is not the case that (n == 20 and k == 10000000000), and `k` is not equal to 4294967295. It is not the case that (n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2), and `k` is not equal to 3000000000. Furthermore, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`. If `a[d] == 0`, then `d` is `len(a) - 2`, otherwise `d` is `len(a) - 1`. `g` is either 1 or 2. If `a[g] == 0`, then `g` is 1, otherwise `g` remains 0. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If no exception occurs, `a[g]` and `a[d]` are decremented by 1, and if `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1, and if `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
