Let's analyze the given task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `z` is initialized to 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
   - `k` is explicitly set to 199999999999999.
   - There are additional conditions provided, but they do not affect the print statement in question.

2. **Python Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('199999')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement explicitly outputs the string '199999'.
   - The value of `k` is given as 199999999999999, but this value is not used in the print statement.
   - The other variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`) are mentioned but are not used in the print statement.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the print statement directly outputs the string '199999', no further computation or variable substitution is needed.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **199999**
