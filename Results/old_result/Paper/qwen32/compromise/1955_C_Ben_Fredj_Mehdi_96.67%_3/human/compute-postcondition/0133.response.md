Let's analyze the given task step-by-step based on the provided initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `z` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('10000')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'10000'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet.
- The `print` statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'10000'` regardless of the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **10000**
