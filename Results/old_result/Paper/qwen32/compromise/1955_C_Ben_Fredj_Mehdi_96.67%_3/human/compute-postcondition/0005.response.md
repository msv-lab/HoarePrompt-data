The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` was previously a string, and `n` and `k` were derived from the first and second parts of that string, respectively.

After the execution of the code snippet:
- The variable `a` is no longer a string but a list of integers obtained from the input.
- The variables `t`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.**
