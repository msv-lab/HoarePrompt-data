The code snippet provided initializes the variable `g` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, and `d`) are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 0.**
