The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

If `num` was initially 1, `count` was 2, and now it becomes 3. If `num` was not 1, `count` was 1, and now it becomes 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`T` is `T - 1`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n`, `y` are integers obtained from the input, `list0` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.**
