The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` modifies the variable `ans` by adding the result of `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its current value. The value of `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` are not provided, so we will keep them as they are. The variable `c` and the list `s` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`c` is the next element in the list `s` after the current `c`; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
