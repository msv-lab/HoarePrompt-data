Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[2, 0]` if the previous `c` was 0 and the current `c` is 0, `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` was 0 and the current `c` is 1, `[0, 2]` if the previous `c` was 1 and the current `c` is 1, `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` was 1 and the current `c` is 0. If the previous `c` was 0 and the current `c` is 0, `ans` is `0` if `cnt[1]` is `0` and `ans` is `1` if `cnt[1]` is `1`. If the previous `c` was 0 and the current `c` is 1, `ans` is `1`. If the previous `c` was 1 and the current `c` is 1, `ans` is `0` if `cnt[1]` is `0`, `ans` is `1` if `cnt[1]` is `1`, and `ans` is `2` if `cnt[1]` is `2`. If the previous `c` was 1 and the current `c` is 0, `ans` is `0` if `cnt[1]` is `0` and `ans` is `1` if `cnt[1]` is `1`. If the previous `c` was 0 and the current `c` is 0, `ans` is `zeroes - 2`. If the previous `c` was 0 and the current `c` is 1, `ans` is `zeroes - 1`. If the previous `c` was 1 and the current `c` is 1, `ans` is `2 * zeroes`. If the previous `c` was 1 and the current `c` is 0, `ans` is `2 * zeroes - 2`. `n` is greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input and has at least one element; `zeroes` is the count of `0`s in the list `s`; `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
