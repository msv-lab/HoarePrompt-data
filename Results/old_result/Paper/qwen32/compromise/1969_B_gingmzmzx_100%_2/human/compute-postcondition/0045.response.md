The provided code snippet increments the variable `ans` by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is `t - 1`.
- `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
- `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is updated such that if `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.
- `ans` is incremented by 1 if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0.
- `c` is the next element in the list `s`.

The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` directly modifies `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to it.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is `t - 1`, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated such that if `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the previous `ans` plus `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
