Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[0, 0]` with the first element incremented by 1 since `c == 0`, `ans` is `0`, `n` is greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input and has at least one element, `zeroes` is the count of `0`s in the list `s`.**
