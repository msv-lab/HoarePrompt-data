Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `s` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one more element after the current `c`, `zeroes` is the count of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 2]`, and `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
