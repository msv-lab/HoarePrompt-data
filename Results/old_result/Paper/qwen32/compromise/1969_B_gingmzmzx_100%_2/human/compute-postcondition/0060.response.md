Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[1, 0]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 1]`. `ans` is `0` if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. `n` is greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input and has at least one element, `zeroes` is the count of `0`s in the list `s`.**
