### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to compute the minimum cost to sort each binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The approach taken in the program is based on counting inversions in the string, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed to sort the string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - It counts the total number of zeroes `zeroes` in the string `s`.

3. **Inversion Counting**:
   - It initializes two counters `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - It updates the respective counter in `cnt`.
     - If `c` is a zero, it adds to `ans` if there have been ones encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is a one, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing each string, it prints the accumulated `ans`, which represents the minimum cost to sort the string.

### Analysis:

- **Inversion Counting**: The logic of counting inversions is correct. An inversion in a binary string is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] > s[j]`. In the context of binary strings, each `1` that appears before a `0` contributes to the inversion count.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost to fix each inversion is correctly calculated by considering the length of the substring that needs to be cyclically shifted.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as strings with all zeroes or all ones, where the cost is `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the minimum cost to sort each binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts based on the inversion count.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
