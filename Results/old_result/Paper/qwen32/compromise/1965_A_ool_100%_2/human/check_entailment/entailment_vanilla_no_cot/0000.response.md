Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and optimal play strategies described in the problem statement. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not properly simulate the game or determine the winner based on the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) strategy, which is typically used for such impartial games.

Here's a brief explanation of the correct approach:

1. **Game Theory Insight**: This problem is a variation of the Nim game. The key insight is that the game can be analyzed using the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero at the start of a player's turn, that player has a winning strategy. If it is zero, the player to move is in a losing position if the opponent plays optimally.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each test case, compute the XOR of all pile sizes.
   - If the result is non-zero, Alice (the first player) has a winning strategy.
   - If the result is zero, Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy if Alice plays optimally.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    if nim_sum != 0:
        print("Alice")
    else:
        print("Bob")
```

This program reads the input, calculates the Nim-sum for each test case, and prints the correct winner based on the Nim-sum.
