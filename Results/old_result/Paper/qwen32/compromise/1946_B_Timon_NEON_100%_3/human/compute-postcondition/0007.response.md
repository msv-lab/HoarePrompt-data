The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. This new segment is created by concatenating `new_segment` (which is initially an empty list) with a list containing the last index of the array `arr` (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`).

Given the initial state, `new_segment` is an empty list, so the new segment added to `segments_variants` will simply be `[len(arr) - 1]`. The values of `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and the other elements in `segments_variants` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_segment` is [], `max_segment` is [max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment], `segments_variants` is [[sum1, end_index1], [sum2, end_index2], ..., [max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment, len(arr) - 1], [len(arr) - 1]], `max_sum` is -1**
