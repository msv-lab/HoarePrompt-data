To determine the output state, we need to analyze the loop and see how the variables are updated. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `new_segment` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `max_segment` is initialized as a list containing the maximum sum of a segment and the end index of that segment.
   - `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment and its end index, with the last element being `[len(arr) - 1]`.
   - `max_sum` is initialized to -1.
   - `total_max_segment` is initialized to `[-1]`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each segment in `segments_variants`.
   - For each segment, it checks if the sum of the current segment (`segment[0]`) is greater than the current `total_max_segment[0]` and ensures that the segment is not just a single index (`len(segment) != 1`).
   - If the condition is met, `total_max_segment` is updated to the current segment.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the maximum sum from `segments_variants` that is not a single index.
   - The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.

Given the loop's logic, the `total_max_segment` will be updated to the segment with the highest sum that is not just a single index value. 

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **new_segment is [], max_segment is [max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment], segments_variants is [[sum1, end_index1], [sum2, end_index2], ..., [max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment, len(arr) - 1], [len(arr) - 1]], max_sum is -1, total_max_segment is [max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment]**. 

Here, `[max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment]` refers to the segment with the highest sum that is not a single index.
