The code appends a new element to the `segments_variants` list. This new element is formed by concatenating the `max_segment` list with a list containing the value `len(arr) - 1`. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_segment` is [], `max_segment` is [max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment], `segments_variants` is [[sum1, end_index1], [sum2, end_index2], ..., [max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment, len(arr) - 1]], `max_sum` is -1**. 

In simpler terms, `segments_variants` now includes an additional segment that consists of the elements from `max_segment` followed by `len(arr) - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
