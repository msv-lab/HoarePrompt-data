Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to perform exactly `k` operations on an array `a` of `n` integers. In each operation, we select any contiguous subarray of `a` (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. Our goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` such operations and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The best strategy to maximize the sum is to repeatedly add the sum of the maximum contiguous subarray (found using Kadane's algorithm) to the array. This is because adding a large positive sum to the array will increase the total sum the most.
2. **Empty Subarray**: If the maximum contiguous subarray sum is non-positive, it is better to add the sum of an empty subarray (which is zero) to avoid decreasing the sum.
3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at the end.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number.
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is supposed to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum and its indices. However, it has some issues:
   - It incorrectly handles the case when the maximum sum is non-positive.
   - It does not correctly update the `max_segment` when a new positive number is encountered.
   - It incorrectly handles the end of the array and does not correctly append the last segment to `segments_variants`.
   - It does not correctly determine the `total_max_segment` from `segments_variants`.
3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is incomplete and does not implement the logic to perform the operations and compute the final sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It has several logical errors and does not handle all edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
