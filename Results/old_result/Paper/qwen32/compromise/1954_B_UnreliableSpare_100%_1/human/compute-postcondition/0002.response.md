The provided code snippet only initializes a variable `flag` to `True`. No other variables are modified, and no operations are performed that would affect the existing state of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `arr`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial state with the addition of the `flag` variable being set to `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input; `flag` is `True`.**
