The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns them to the variable `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold the list of integers provided in the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
