Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if all elements in the list are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same in the list.**
