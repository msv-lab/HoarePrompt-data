Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not handle the number of test cases correctly. It is hardcoded to handle exactly 10 test cases, as specified by the loop `for i in range(10)`. This means that the program will fail if the number of test cases `t` is not exactly 10, which contradicts the problem description that `t` can range from 1 to 100.

The original assessment correctly identifies this issue and provides a corrected version of the program that reads the number of test cases `t` and uses a loop that runs `t` times. This corrected version will handle any valid number of test cases as specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
