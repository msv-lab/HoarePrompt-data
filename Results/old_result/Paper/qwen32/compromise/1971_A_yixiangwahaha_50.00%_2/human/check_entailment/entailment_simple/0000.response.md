Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to process multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers, x and y. The program should output the minimum and maximum of these two integers for each test case. However, there is a critical issue in the program: it always reads exactly 10 test cases regardless of the value of `t` provided by the user. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the program will still attempt to read 10 lines of input, which will likely result in an error or incorrect behavior. Additionally, if `t` is greater than 10, the program will only process the first 10 test cases and ignore the rest.

Given the problem description, the program should read `t` test cases and process each one accordingly. The current implementation does not correctly handle the number of test cases specified by `t`.

Correctness: **False**
