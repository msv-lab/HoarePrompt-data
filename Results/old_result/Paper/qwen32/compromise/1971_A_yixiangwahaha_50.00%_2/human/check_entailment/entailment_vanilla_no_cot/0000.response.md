Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. The program assumes there are always 10 test cases (`for i in range(10):`), but the number of test cases `t` is given as input and can vary between 1 and 100.
2. The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not use it. It should be used to determine the number of iterations for reading the test cases.
3. The program uses two separate lists, `x` and `y`, to store the values. While this is not incorrect, it is unnecessary and can be simplified.
4. The program prints an extra space after each number in the output (`print(x[i], ' ', y[i])`), which is not required according to the output format specified in the problem description.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))

func()
```

This version reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times, reading two integers per test case and printing the minimum and maximum of the two integers without any extra spaces.
