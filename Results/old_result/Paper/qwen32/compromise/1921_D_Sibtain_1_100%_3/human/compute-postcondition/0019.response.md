Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1; `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order; `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, and `t2` is greater than `t1`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
