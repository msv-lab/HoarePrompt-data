The provided code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `c`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, or `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the final value after all comparisons, `j` is the final value after all comparisons.**
