The provided code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the value of `a` will change based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Only `a` is reassigned to a new list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the final value after all comparisons, `j` is the final value after all comparisons**
