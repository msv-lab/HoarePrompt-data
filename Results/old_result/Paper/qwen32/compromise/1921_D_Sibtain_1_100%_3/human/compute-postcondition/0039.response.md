To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the calculations leading to the value of `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. **n** and **m**: Integers read from input.
3. **a**: A sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1.
4. **c**: A list of integers read from input sorted in descending order.
5. **i**: The number of times `t1` was the maximum or equal to `t2` during the iterations.
6. **j**: The number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` during the iterations.
7. **ans**: The sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered.
8. **k**: Equal to `len(a)`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is described as the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered. However, the specific pairs and the logic to compute these differences are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Given the lack of specific details about the pairs and the logic, we can infer that `ans` is computed through some comparison and summation process involving the lists `a` and `c`.

### Output Description:
Since the exact logic to compute `ans` is not provided, we can describe `ans` as the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered during the iterations. We can't give a specific numerical value without more information, but we can describe it based on the given context.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered during the iterations)**
