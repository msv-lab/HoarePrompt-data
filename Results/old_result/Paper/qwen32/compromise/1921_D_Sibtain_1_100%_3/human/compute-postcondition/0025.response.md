The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(a[i] - c[i])` to `t1`. Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers and `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, the value of `t1` will be the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of `a` and the `i`-th element of `c`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged except for `t1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`**.
