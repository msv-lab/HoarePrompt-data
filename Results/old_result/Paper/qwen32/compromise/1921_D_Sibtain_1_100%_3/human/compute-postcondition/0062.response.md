The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the length of the list `a`. If `k` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**
