Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1; `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order; `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, and `t2` is greater than `t1`.**
