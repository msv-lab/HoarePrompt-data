Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `c` is a list of integers read from input; `i` is the number of times `t1` was the maximum or equal to `t2` during the iterations; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` during the iterations; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered; `k` is equal to `len(a)`**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. The program simply proceeds to the next iteration of the loop (if within a loop) without modifying any of the existing variables.
