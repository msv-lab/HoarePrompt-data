The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Based on the initial state, `rightZero` is initially set to 2 if the character at position `i` in `s` is '0', or 0 otherwise. After the increment, `rightZero` will be 3 if it was initially 2, or 1 if it was initially 0.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is the string input from the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`; `i` is `mid + 1`; `rightZero` is 3 if the character at position `i` in `s` is '0', or 1 otherwise; `trightZero` is 1 if the character at position `i` in `s` is '0', or 0 otherwise; `rightOne` is 0.**
