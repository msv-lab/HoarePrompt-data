Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`. If the current character `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is `1`, `rightZero` is `0`, `leftOne` is `0`, `rightOne` is `0`, `tleftZero` is `1`, `trightZero` is `0`, `tleftOne` is `0`, and `trightOne` is `0`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is `0`, `rightZero` is `0`, `leftOne` is `1`, `rightOne` is `0`, `tleftZero` is `0`, `trightZero` is `0`, `tleftOne` is `1`, and `trightOne` is `0`.**
