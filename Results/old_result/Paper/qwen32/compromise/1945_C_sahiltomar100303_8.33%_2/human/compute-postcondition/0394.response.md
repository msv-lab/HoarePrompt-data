Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of houses `n` and a string `s` indicating the side preference ('0' for left, '1' for right) of each resident. For each test case, it determines and prints the optimal number of residents that can be accommodated on the left side such that the number of residents on each side is as balanced as possible, with the left side having at least as many residents as the right side if the total number of residents is odd.**
