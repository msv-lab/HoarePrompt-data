The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0. The variable `n` is introduced and assigned a value based on user input, which is converted to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**
