The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `trightZero` to 0. It does not affect any of the other variables. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the initialization of `trightZero`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input from the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0.**
