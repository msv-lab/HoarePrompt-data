Given the initial state of the variables, we can determine the value that will be printed by the statement `print(left)`.

From the initial state, we have:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is 2.
- `s` is "00".
- `mid` is 1.
- `left` is not 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `leftMove` is 0.
- `rightZero` is 1.
- `trightZero` is 0.
- `rightOne` is 0.
- `trightOne` is 0.
- `leftZero` is 0.
- `leftOne` is 0.
- `right` is 2, and `right` equals `n`.
- `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2.

The specific value of `left` is given as "not 0", but no exact value is provided. However, since we are only asked to print `left` and the problem statement does not specify any further manipulation or calculation involving `left`, we can directly use the provided information.

Therefore, the `print(left)` statement will print the value of `left`, which is described as "not 0".

Output: **left (where left is not 0)**
