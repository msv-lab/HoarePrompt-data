The code snippet `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `leftZero` is either 2 (if the character at position `i` in `s` is '0') or 0 (if the character at position `i` in `s` is not '0'). After the increment, `leftZero` will be either 3 or 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is at least 2; `s` is the string input from the user; `mid` is `n // 2` (which will be at least 1); `i` is 2. If the character at position `i` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 3, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2, `trightOne` is 0.**
