The code snippet `trightZero -= 1` decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. Given that the initial value of `trightZero` is 2, after executing the code, `trightZero` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `right` is 1**.
