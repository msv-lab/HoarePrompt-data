The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 4; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`; `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`; `left` is `mid - 2`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is the final value when the loop stops; `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`.**
