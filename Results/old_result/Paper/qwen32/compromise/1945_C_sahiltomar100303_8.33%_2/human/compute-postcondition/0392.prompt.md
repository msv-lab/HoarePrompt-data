Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses. This is followed by a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` can be 0 or not 0; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `right` is 2. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the condition does not affect the variables further. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `mid` and `left` is either less than or equal to the absolute difference between `mid` and `right`, or greater than the absolute difference between `mid` and `right`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the final count of '0's in the first half of `s` after the loop; `rightZero` is the final count of '0's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `leftOne` is the final count of '1's in the first half of `s` after the loop; `rightOne` is the final count of '1's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `tleftZero` is at least `(right + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `tleftOne` is at least `(n // 2 + 1) // 2 - tleftZero`; `trightOne` is at least `(n - right + 1) // 2`; `left` is `0` if the loop has not completed its full iteration, otherwise it is not `0`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is the final value when the loop stops. If `left` is `0` and `right` equals `n`, then `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not `0` and `right` equals `n`, then `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2` if it is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise, it is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is adjusted based on the characters moved; `leftOne` is adjusted such that `leftOne` is consistent with `leftZero`; `rightOne` is adjusted such that if `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, `rightOne < (n + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is adjusted such that `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` if `right == n`, otherwise `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` is the count of '0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1` minus the characters moved; `tleftOne` is adjusted such that `tleftOne >= (right + 1) // 2`; `trightOne` is the count of non-'0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1` minus the characters moved; `left` is 0 if the if condition is met, otherwise `left` is not 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is `k` where `k` is the position where the loop terminates and `k` is not equal to `n`, or `right` is `n` if the loop terminates at `n`. If `right == n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`. If `right != n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
