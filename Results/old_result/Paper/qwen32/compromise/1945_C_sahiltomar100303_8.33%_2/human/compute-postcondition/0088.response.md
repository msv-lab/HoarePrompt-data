The code snippet `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Given the initial state, `tleftOne` was 0, so after this operation, `tleftOne` becomes 1.

All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `right` is 1; the character at index `right` in `s` is not '0'; `tleftOne` is 1.**
