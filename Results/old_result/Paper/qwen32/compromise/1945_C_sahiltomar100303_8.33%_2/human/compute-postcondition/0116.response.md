Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `right` is 2. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the condition does not affect the variables further. If `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
