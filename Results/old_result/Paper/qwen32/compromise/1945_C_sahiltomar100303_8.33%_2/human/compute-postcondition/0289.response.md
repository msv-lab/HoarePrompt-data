Output State: **`i` is `mid`; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftZero` is `leftZero + 1`**

In natural language: The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged, with `i` still being equal to `mid` and `mid` still being equal to `n // 2`, which must be greater than 0.
