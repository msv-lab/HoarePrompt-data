The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `leftZero` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `mid`; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftZero` is `leftZero + 1`; `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `mid`; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftZero` is `leftZero + 1`; `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`**.
