Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is `-3` if `s[left - 3]` and `s[left - 2]` are both '0', `-2` if only `s[left - 3]` is '0', and `-1` if `s[left - 3]` is not '0'. `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 3 if both `s[left - 3]` and `s[left - 2]` are '0', plus 2 if only `s[left - 3]` is '0', plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is '0', and the original count otherwise. `leftOne` is `0` if `s[left - 3]` is '0', and `leftOne - 1` otherwise. `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 3]` is '0' or `s[left - 2]` is not '0', plus 2 if both `s[left - 3]` and `s[left - 2]` are not '0', and must be less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`. `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the same adjustments as `rightZero`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the same adjustments as `rightOne`, and must be less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`. `left` is `n // 2 - 3` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is `0`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n // 2 + 4) // 2`.**

In natural language: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, affecting the calculations for `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` based on the characters at the new `left` position and the conditions provided. All other variables remain unchanged.
