Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in the loop where it calculates the sum of digit sums for numbers from 10 to n. The loop is incorrectly using the variable `n` instead of `max(numbers)` which can lead to an `IndexError` if `n` in any test case is less than the maximum `n` across all test cases. Specifically, the loop should iterate up to `max(numbers)` instead of `n`.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
for i in range(10, n + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    sum_values[i] = sum_total
```
It should be:
```python
max_n = max(numbers)
for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    sum_values[i] = sum_total
```

Additionally, the function `func_1()` is called before its definition, which will raise a `NameError`. The function call should be moved after the function definition.

Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

With these corrections, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
