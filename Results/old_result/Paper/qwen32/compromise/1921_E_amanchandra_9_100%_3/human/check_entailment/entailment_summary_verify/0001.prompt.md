You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of grid dimensions `h` and `w`, and coordinates of two distinct points `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` on the grid. For each test case, it determines and prints the result of a game where Alice and Bob compete based on their positions and the grid dimensions. The result can be 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who move their chips on a checkered board. Alice's chip can move down, down-left, or down-right, while Bob's chip can move up, up-left, or up-right. The game ends when a player lands on the same cell as the other player, or when a player cannot make a move.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Conditions**: Alice starts above Bob or vice versa (since they cannot start on the same cell).
2. **Movement Constraints**: Alice can only move down, and Bob can only move up.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they land on the same cell as the other player.
4. **Draw Condition**: If a player is in the last row (Alice) or first row (Bob), and cannot move, the game is a draw.

### Strategy

- If Alice is initially in a row strictly above Bob, Alice can always move down, and Bob can always move up. Alice will win if she can reach Bob's row before Bob reaches Alice's row.
- If Alice and Bob are initially in the same row, it's a draw because neither can move towards the other.
- If Alice is initially in a row strictly below Bob, Bob can always move up, and Alice can always move down. Bob will win if he can reach Alice's row before Alice reaches Bob's row.

### Detailed Analysis of the Program

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice and Bob.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
```

#### Case Analysis

1. **Alice is initially in a row strictly above Bob (`a < c`)**:
   - `x = abs(a - c) // 2`: The maximum number of moves Alice can make towards Bob's row.
   - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true (odd number of rows between them):
     - `l = max(1, d - x)`: The leftmost column Alice can reach in her final move.
     - `r = min(w, d + x)`: The rightmost column Alice can reach in her final move.
     - Alice wins if Bob can be in any column between `l` and `r` in his final move.
   - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is false (even number of rows between them):
     - `l = max(1, b - x)`: The leftmost column Bob can reach in his final move.
     - `r = min(w, b + x)`: The rightmost column Bob can reach in his final move.
     - Bob wins if Alice can be in any column between `l` and `r` in her final move.
   
2. **Alice is initially in a row strictly below Bob (`a > c`)**:
   - The program directly prints 'Draw', which is incorrect because Bob should be able to win in this case.

### Conclusion

The program incorrectly handles the case when Alice is initially in a row strictly below Bob. It should print 'Bob' in this scenario, not 'Draw'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
