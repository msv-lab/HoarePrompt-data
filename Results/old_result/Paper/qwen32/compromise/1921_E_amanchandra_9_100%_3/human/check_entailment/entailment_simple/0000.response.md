### Reasoning

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code and how it relates to the problem statement.

1. **Game Dynamics**:
    - Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right.
    - Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right.
    - The game ends in a win for a player if they land on the other player's chip.
    - The game ends in a draw if a player cannot make a move.

2. **Key Observations**:
    - If Alice is initially below Bob (i.e., `x_a > x_b`), Alice can always move towards Bob, and Bob cannot move towards Alice. Therefore, Alice will win unless she is at the bottom row or Bob is at the top row, leading to a draw.
    - If Alice is initially above Bob (i.e., `x_a < x_b`), the game can be more complex. Alice and Bob will try to meet at a cell where they can capture each other. The strategy involves calculating the range of columns Alice can reach and checking if Bob can intercept her within that range.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
    - The code correctly identifies the scenario where Alice is initially below Bob (`a > c`), resulting in a draw if Alice cannot move down or Bob cannot move up.
    - For the scenario where Alice is initially above Bob (`a < c`), the code calculates the range of columns Alice can reach (`l` to `r`) after `x` moves (where `x` is half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob, rounded down).
    - It then checks if Bob can reach any of these columns within `x + 1` (or `x` for even distances) moves. If Bob can, he wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

4. **Code Review**:
    - The code correctly handles the input parsing and the main logic for determining the game outcome.
    - The use of list indexing for conditional print statements (`print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])`) is a bit unconventional but functionally correct.
    - The code adheres to the problem constraints and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic required to determine the outcome of the game based on the given conditions and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
