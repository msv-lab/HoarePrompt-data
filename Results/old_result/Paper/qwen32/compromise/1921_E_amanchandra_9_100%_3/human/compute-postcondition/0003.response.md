Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four positive integers `h` and `w` representing the dimensions of a grid, and four more positive integers `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` representing the coordinates of two distinct points on the grid. The function returns a value for each test case based on the given coordinates and grid dimensions.**
