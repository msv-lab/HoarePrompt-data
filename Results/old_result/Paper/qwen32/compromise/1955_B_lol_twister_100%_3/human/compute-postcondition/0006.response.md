The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `k`, `c`, and `d` are given integers, and `h` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the initial state, the value of `h` was previously known and is now incremented by 1. The list `li` now contains an additional element which is the result of the expression `a + k * c + d * h`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing elements including `a + k * c + d * h`, `h` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
