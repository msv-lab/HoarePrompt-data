The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. After appending, the value of `k` and `h` are incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6
- `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the `(n+1)-th` element is `a + k * c + d * h`
- `k` is `k + 1`
- `h` is `h + 1`

After executing the line `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)`, the list `li` now contains `n+2` elements, with the last element being `a + k * c + d * h`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n+2` elements where the first `n+1` elements are `a + k * c + d * i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, and the `(n+2)-th` element is `a + (k+1) * c + d * (h+1)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `h` is `h + 1`**
