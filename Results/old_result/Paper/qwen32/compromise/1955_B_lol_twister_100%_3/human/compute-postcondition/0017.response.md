The given code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. After this operation, `k` and `h` are incremented by 1.

Since the code only modifies `li` by appending a new element and does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, or `h` directly (except for incrementing `k` and `h`), these variables retain their previous values.

The new element appended to `li` is `a + k * c + d * h`. After appending, `k` and `h` are incremented by 1, so the new values of `k` and `h` are `k + 1` and `h + 1` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n+3` elements where the first `n+2` elements are `a + k * c + d * i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n+1`, and the `(n+3)-th` element is `a + (k+1) * c + d * (h+1)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `h` is `h + 1`.**
