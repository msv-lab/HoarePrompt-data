To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for h in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable that can be adjusted is `h`. The variable `h` is the loop counter and it ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6
- `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is a list containing `2*n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are `a + k*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are `a + (k+1)*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last element is `a + (k+1)*c + d*h`
- `k` is `k + 1`

At the end of the previous iteration, `h` would have taken a specific value. To proceed to the next iteration, `h` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `h` was `h_prev`. For the next iteration, `h` should be `h_prev + 1`. Since the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`, the next value of `h` should be within this range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `2*n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are `a + k*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are `a + (k+1)*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last element is `a + (k+1)*c + d*h`, `k` is `k + 1`, `h` is `h + 1`**
