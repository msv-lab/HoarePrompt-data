The given Python code snippet only initializes an empty list named `li`. No other variables are modified, and no calculations or changes are made to the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`). 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the new list `li` which is initialized.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is an empty list.**
