To determine the final state of the loop after all iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the list `li`. The loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, it appends a new element to `li` based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4].
   - `n` is an integer within the range [2, 500].
   - `c` and `d` are integers within the range [1, 10^6].
   - `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` is within the range [1, 10^9].
   - `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`.
   - `li` is initially an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `n` times with `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
   - In each iteration, the loop appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`.

After `n` iterations, the list `li` will contain `n` elements, specifically:
- `li[0] = a + k * c + d * 0`
- `li[1] = a + k * c + d * 1`
- `li[2] = a + k * c + d * 2`
- ...
- `li[n-1] = a + k * c + d * (n-1)`

Thus, the final state of `li` will be a list of `n` elements where each element is calculated using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

**Output State**: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**

In natural language, after all iterations, the list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` where `h` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
