The given code snippet appends a new element to the list `li`. Specifically, it appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to `li`.

Given the initial state, `li` already contains `2*n` elements. The first `n` elements are calculated as `a + k*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the next `n` elements are calculated as `a + (k+1)*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. After executing the provided line of code, `li` will have one additional element.

Since `k` is incremented by 1 before this operation, the appended element will be `a + (k+1) * c + d * h`. Here, `h` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume `h` is a variable that holds some integer value.

Therefore, the updated list `li` will now contain `2*n + 1` elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `2*n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are `a + k*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are `a + (k+1)*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last element is `a + (k+1)*c + d*h`, `k` is `k + 1`**.
