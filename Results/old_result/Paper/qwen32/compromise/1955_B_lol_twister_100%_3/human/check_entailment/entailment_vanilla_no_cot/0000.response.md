Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to check if a given list of `n^2` integers can form a specific type of matrix called a "progressive square". The matrix is constructed using the formula:
\[ a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \]
where \( a_{1,1} \) is the smallest element in the matrix.

### Program Analysis
The provided program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
3. It reads the list of \( n^2 \) integers.
4. It calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.
5. Inside `func_1`, it finds the minimum value in the list, which is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
6. It generates the expected values for the progressive square using the formula.
7. It sorts both the generated list and the input list.
8. It checks if the sorted lists are equal and returns "yes" if they are, otherwise "no".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Assumption about \( a_{1,1} \)**: The program assumes that the smallest element in the list is \( a_{1,1} \). However, this assumption is incorrect because \( a_{1,1} \) is not necessarily the smallest element in the progressive square. The smallest element could be different based on the values of \( c \) and \( d \).

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program correctly generates the progressive square values but incorrectly assumes the smallest element in the input list is \( a_{1,1} \).

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate the progressive square for all possible values of \( a_{1,1} \) and check if the input list matches any of these squares. However, since the problem guarantees that there is exactly one progressive square for given \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), we can deduce that the smallest element in the input list must indeed be \( a_{1,1} \) if the input list can form a progressive square. Therefore, the current approach might work under the assumption that the problem constraints ensure the smallest element is \( a_{1,1} \).

However, the code should handle the case sensitivity of the output correctly.

### Conclusion
Given the assumptions and the problem constraints, the program seems to work correctly. But the code should explicitly handle the case sensitivity of the output.

Let's modify the code to ensure the output is always in lowercase:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, c, d, l)
    print(result.lower())

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

Since the logic of the program is correct and the only issue was the case sensitivity of the output, the original program is essentially correct.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
