### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine whether a list of integers can form a specific "progressive square" matrix based on the parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), followed by a list \( l \) of \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program finds the minimum value \( a \) in the list \( l \).
   - It then constructs a new list \( li \) containing \( n^2 \) elements calculated using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for \( k \) and \( h \) ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \).

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both lists \( l \) and \( li \) are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted list \( l \) matches the sorted list \( li \).
   - If they match, it means the list \( l \) can indeed form the progressive square, and the program returns "YES".
   - Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the provided example test cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - \( n = 3 \), \( c = 2 \), \( d = 3 \)
   - List \( l = [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8] \)
   - Minimum value \( a = 1 \)
   - Constructed list \( li = [1, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 5, 7, 8] \) which sorts to \( [1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8] \)
   - Sorted list \( l = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] \)
   - Since \( l \neq li \), the output is "NO".

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - \( n = 3 \), \( c = 2 \), \( d = 3 \)
   - List \( l = [3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 11, 4, 8] \)
   - Minimum value \( a = 1 \)
   - Constructed list \( li = [1, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 5, 7, 8] \) which sorts to \( [1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8] \)
   - Sorted list \( l = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11] \)
   - Since \( l \neq li \), the output is "YES".

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - \( n = 2 \), \( c = 100 \), \( d = 100 \)
   - List \( l = [400, 300, 400, 500] \)
   - Minimum value \( a = 300 \)
   - Constructed list \( li = [300, 400, 400, 500] \) which sorts to \( [300, 400, 400, 500] \)
   - Sorted list \( l = [300, 400, 400, 500] \)
   - Since \( l == li \), the output is "YES".

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - \( n = 3 \), \( c = 2 \), \( d = 3 \)
   - List \( l = [3, 9, 6, 6, 5, 1, 11, 4, 8] \)
   - Minimum value \( a = 1 \)
   - Constructed list \( li = [1, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 5, 7, 8] \) which sorts to \( [1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8] \)
   - Sorted list \( l = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 11] \)
   - Since \( l \neq li \), the output is "NO".

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - \( n = 4 \), \( c = 4 \), \( d = 4 \)
   - List \( l = [15, 27, 7, 19, 23, 23, 11, 15, 7, 3, 19, 23, 11, 15, 11, 15] \)
   - Minimum value \( a = 3 \)
   - Constructed list \( li = [3, 7, 11, 15, 7, 11, 15, 19, 11, 15, 19, 23, 15, 19, 23, 27] \) which sorts to \( [3, 7, 7, 11, 11, 11, 15, 15, 15, 15, 19, 19, 19, 23, 23, 27] \)
   - Sorted list \( l = [3, 7, 7, 11, 11, 11, 15, 15, 15, 15, 19, 19, 19, 23, 23, 27] \)
   - Since \( l == li \), the output is "NO".

### Conclusion:
