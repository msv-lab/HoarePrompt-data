You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Understanding the Progressive Square Construction**:
   - The progressive square is defined by its top-left element `a_{1,1}` (which is the smallest element in the list `l`), and two constants `c` and `d`.
   - Each element in the square can be calculated using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`, where `i` and `j` are the row and column indices starting from 1.
   - This means that for a given `n`, `c`, and `d`, there is exactly one possible progressive square.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n*n` integers.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to determine if the list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters.
   
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It finds the minimum value in the list `l` and assigns it to `a` (which corresponds to `a_{1,1}`).
   - It constructs a new list `li` by calculating each element of the progressive square using the formula `a + k*c + d*h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It sorts both `li` and the original list `l`.
   - If the sorted `li` matches the sorted `l`, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest element in the list as `a_{1,1}`.
   - It accurately constructs the progressive square using the given formula.
   - By sorting both lists and comparing them, it ensures that the provided list `l` contains exactly the same elements as the progressive square.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the given list of integers can form a progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.

**Correctness:** **True**
