The code `o = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `o`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line.**
