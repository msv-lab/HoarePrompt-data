The given task involves a complex set of conditions and variable definitions. However, the key point to focus on for determining the output of the `print('YES')` statement is that the statement itself does not depend on the values of the variables `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, `dic`, `l`, or `k`. 

The `print('YES')` statement is a standalone print statement that outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the context or the values of the variables defined in the initial state.

Let's summarize the reasoning:
- The `print('YES')` statement is a direct output statement.
- It does not rely on any of the variables or their values.
- The execution of the print statement is unconditional and will always output `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
