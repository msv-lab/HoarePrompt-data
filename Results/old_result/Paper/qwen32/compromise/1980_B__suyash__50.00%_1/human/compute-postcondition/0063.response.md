The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value (which is not specified, but let's denote it as `i_current`). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_current + 1`. Additionally, `t` must be greater than `i_current + 1` for the loop to continue.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration only specifies `i`, we can infer that `i` needs to be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `t` must be greater than `i_current + 1`**

However, since we do not have the exact value of `i_current`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
