Postcondition: **`i` is the length of `l` + 1, `k` is `b[2]`, `t` is greater than the length of `l` + 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user's input, `n` is `b[0]`, and `f` is `b[1]`. If `k` equals `n`, the conditions remain as described. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
