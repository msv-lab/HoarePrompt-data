The given initial state provides information about the values and relationships of several variables, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('MAYBE')
```

This statement will print the string `'MAYBE'` exactly as it is written.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **MAYBE**
