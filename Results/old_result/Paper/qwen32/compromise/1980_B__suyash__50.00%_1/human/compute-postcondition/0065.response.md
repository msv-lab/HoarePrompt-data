The code takes the string `a`, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `b`. The values of `i` and `t` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a` is a string equal to the user's input, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `a`**.
