Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `f`, and `k` where `n` is the length of a list `a` and `f` and `k` are additional parameters. It also accepts a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a` for each test case.**
