The `while` loop condition is `while n:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is not zero. Given that `n` is described as "a non-zero integer minus 1," we need to ensure that `n` is still non-zero after the previous iteration for the loop to execute again.

### Analysis:
- **`n`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is described as "a non-zero integer minus 1." This implies that `n` could be positive or negative, but it is definitely not zero. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` should not be zero. Since `n` is a non-zero integer minus 1, it can be adjusted to any non-zero value. However, to be precise, if `n` was positive, it would now be a positive integer minus 1, and if it was negative, it would be a negative integer minus 1. To keep it simple and ensure it is non-zero, we can adjust `n` to be any non-zero integer. For example, we can set `n` to 1 (if it was positive) or -1 (if it was negative).

### Adjustment:
- Since `n` is a non-zero integer minus 1, we need to ensure it remains non-zero. Let's adjust `n` to 1 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is the sorted list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)], `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**
