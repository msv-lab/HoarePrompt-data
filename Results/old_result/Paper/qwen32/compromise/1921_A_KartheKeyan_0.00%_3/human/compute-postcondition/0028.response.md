The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` were already defined in the initial state, their values get updated based on the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])` (undefined until `coord` has at least 2 elements), `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])` (undefined until `coord` has at least 4 elements), `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.**
