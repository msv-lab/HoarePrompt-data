The loop runs for a fixed number of iterations, specifically 4 times, as defined by `range(4)`. Given the initial state and the states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the state after all 4 iterations.

Here's the breakdown of the loop's effect:
- In each iteration, the loop appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the `coord` list, where `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.
- The loop variable `i` takes on the values 0, 1, 2, and 3 during the 4 iterations.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` are not modified within the loop.

Since the loop runs 4 times, after the 4th iteration, the `coord` list will have 4 tuples appended to it, resulting in a total of 4 tuples in `coord`. The loop variable `i` will be 3 after the last iteration (as the loop variable `i` is set to 3 in the last iteration of `range(4)`).

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with 4 elements, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all 4 iterations, `coord` will contain 4 tuples of coordinates, and the loop variable `i` will be 3. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2`) will remain unchanged from their initial state or will be set based on the first 4 coordinates in `coord`.
