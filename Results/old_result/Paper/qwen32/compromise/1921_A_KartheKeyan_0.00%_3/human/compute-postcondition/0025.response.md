The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `coord` is initially an empty list, the expressions for `p1` and `p2` cannot be evaluated at this point and will remain as specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is [], `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.**
