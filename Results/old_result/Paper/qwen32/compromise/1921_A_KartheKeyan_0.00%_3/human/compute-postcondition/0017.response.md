The code snippet calculates the value of `p2` using the coordinates from the `coord` list. The variable `p1` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.

The value of `p2` is calculated as the square of the difference in the x-coordinates of the fourth and third points in `coord` plus the square of the difference in the y-coordinates of the fourth and third points in `coord`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is the sorted list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)], `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`.**
