The code snippet sorts the list `coord`. Given that `coord` is a list of four tuples, sorting will rearrange the tuples based on their first elements (and the second elements if the first elements are equal). The variables `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

In natural language: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `n` remains 1, `coord` is now a sorted list of the original four coordinate tuples, `res` remains 0, `i` remains 3, and `p1` and `p2` are recalculated based on the new sorted `coord` list.
