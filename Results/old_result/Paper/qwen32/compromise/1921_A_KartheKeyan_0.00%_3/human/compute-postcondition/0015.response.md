The code sorts the list `coord` in ascending order based on the default tuple comparison (first by x, then by y if x values are the same). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is the sorted list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)], `res` is 0, `i` is 3.**

In natural language: The list `coord` has been sorted, while `t`, `n`, `res`, and `i` retain their initial values.
