To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and under what conditions it terminates.

The loop has the following structure:

```python
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))
    print(res)
    n -= 1
```

### Key Variables and Their Changes:
- **`n`**: This variable controls the number of iterations. It starts at some value and is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
- **`coord`**: This is a list that stores the coordinates of the corners of the square. It is populated in each iteration and sorted.
- **`res`**: This variable stores the result of the computation, which is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
- **`p1` and `p2`**: These are the squared distances between adjacent corners of the square, calculated based on the sorted coordinates.

### Loop Termination:
The loop terminates when `n` becomes 0.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, `n` will be 0, and no more iterations will occur. The values of `coord`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` will reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop.

### Output State:
Given the provided initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state after all iterations will be:

- **`n`**: 0 (since the loop terminates when `n` reaches 0)
- **`coord`**: The sorted list of coordinates from the last iteration
- **`res`**: The result computed in the last iteration
- **`p1` and `p2`**: The squared distances computed in the last iteration

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is the sorted list of coordinates from the last iteration, `res` is the result computed in the last iteration, `p1` is the squared distance between the first two sorted coordinates, `p2` is the squared distance between the last two sorted coordinates.**

In simpler terms, the loop will have finished executing all `n` iterations, and `n` will be 0. The variables `coord`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
