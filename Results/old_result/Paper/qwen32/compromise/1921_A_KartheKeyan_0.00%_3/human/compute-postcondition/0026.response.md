The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The list `coord` now contains one element, which is the tuple `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])` (undefined until `coord` has at least 2 elements), `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])` (undefined until `coord` has at least 4 elements), `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.**
