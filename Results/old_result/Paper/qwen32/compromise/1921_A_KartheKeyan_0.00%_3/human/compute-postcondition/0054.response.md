Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value, `coord` is a sorted list with 4 elements, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

In this output state, the value of `p1` has been updated to be the squared Euclidean distance between the points `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
