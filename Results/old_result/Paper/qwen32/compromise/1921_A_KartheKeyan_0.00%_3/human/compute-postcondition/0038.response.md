To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved in the variable `res`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `n` is set to 1.
- `coord` is a sorted list of four coordinate tuples: `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`.
- `res` is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))`.
- `i` is set to 3.
- `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
- `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.

### Calculation of `res`:
The variable `res` is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{res} = \left| \sqrt{(\text{coord}[1][0] - \text{coord}[0][0])} \times \sqrt{(\text{coord}[3][0] - \text{coord}[2][0])} \right| \]

Let's break this down:
- `p1` is the difference in the x-coordinates of the first two points: `coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]`.
- `p2` is the difference in the x-coordinates of the last two points: `coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]`.
- `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

### Final Output:
The `print(res)` statement will output the value of `res` as calculated above. Since the exact coordinates in `coord` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **res (where res is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the differences in the x-coordinates of the first two points and the last two points in the sorted list `coord`)**
