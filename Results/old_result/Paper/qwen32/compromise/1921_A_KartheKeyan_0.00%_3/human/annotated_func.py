#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

    #State: `n` is 0, `coord` is the sorted list of coordinates from the last iteration, `res` is the result computed in the last iteration, `p1` is the squared distance between the first two sorted coordinates, `p2` is the squared distance between the last two sorted coordinates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It then calculates and prints the area of each square.
