Output State: **`start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last number in `nums` that is greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations, effectively the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in `nums` adjusted by the loop's logic, and `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `num_tests` has been decreased by 1, while `start_year` remains unchanged as it was initially defined.
