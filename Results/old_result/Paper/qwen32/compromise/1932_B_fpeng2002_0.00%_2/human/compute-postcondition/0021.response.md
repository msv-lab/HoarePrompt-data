The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range `len(nums)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the last index that was processed, and `len(nums)` is the total number of elements in the list `nums`.

Given that `x` was the last index processed, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `x` should now be `x + 1`. The length of `nums` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `nums[x]`, `x` is `x + 1`**
