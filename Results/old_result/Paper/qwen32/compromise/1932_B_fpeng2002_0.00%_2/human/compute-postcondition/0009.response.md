Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 or `num_tests` is 0 if it was initially 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is incremented by 1, `start_year` is calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `start_year` is recalculated based on the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, and `x` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
