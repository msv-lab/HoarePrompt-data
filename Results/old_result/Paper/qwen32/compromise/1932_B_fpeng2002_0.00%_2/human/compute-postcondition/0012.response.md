To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

The given loop iterates over the list `nums`, updating the `start_year` variable according to the formula:
\[ \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{\text{nums}[x]} + 1\right)\right) * \text{nums}[x]} \]

Starting from `start_year = 0`, the loop calculates `start_year` for each element in `nums`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **First Iteration (x = 0)**: `start_year` becomes `nums[0]`.
3. **Second Iteration (x = 1)**: `start_year` becomes \(\left(\left(\frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{\text{nums}[1]} + 1\right)\right) * \text{nums}[1]}\).
4. **Third Iteration (x = 2)**: `start_year` becomes \(\left(\left(\frac{\text{start\_year} + 1}{\text{nums}[2]} + 1\right)\right) * \text{nums}[2]}\).

This pattern continues until `x` reaches the length of `nums`.

### Final Output State

After all iterations, `start_year` is calculated based on the entire list `nums`. The values of `t`, `num_tests`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 or `num_tests` is 0 if it was initially 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `start_year` is the result of the loop's final calculation.**

In natural language, after all iterations, `t`, `num_tests`, and `n` remain the same as they were initially. `start_year` is updated to a value calculated by the loop based on the entire `nums` list.
