Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is greater than 0 or `num_tests` is 0 if it was initially 1; `n` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is set to the integer value provided by the input, while the values of `t` and `num_tests` remain unchanged from their initial states.
