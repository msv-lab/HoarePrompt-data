The code snippet sets `start_year` to 0, which overrides its previous value. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`start_year` is 0; `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers read from input.**
