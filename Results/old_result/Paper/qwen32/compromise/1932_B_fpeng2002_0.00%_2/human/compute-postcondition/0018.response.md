The code snippet sets `start_year` to 0. The values of `t`, `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `start_year` is 0.**
