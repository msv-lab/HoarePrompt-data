The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, storing these integers in a list named `nums`. This operation does not affect the variables `start_year`, `num_tests`, or `n` directly. However, `nums` is reassigned to a new list of integers.

Output State: **`start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last number in `nums` that is greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations, effectively the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in `nums` adjusted by the loop's logic; `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers read from input.**
