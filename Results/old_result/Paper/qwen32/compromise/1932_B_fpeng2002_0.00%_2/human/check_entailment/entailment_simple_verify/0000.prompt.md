You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` and `nums` are the values from the last test case, `start_year` is the final value calculated for the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The logic used in the program is flawed. Specifically, the line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly determine the next occurrence of the i-th sign after the (i-1)-th sign has occurred.

Let's analyze the logic with an example:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 4
```
The correct sequence of events should be:
1. The first sign occurs in year 2.
2. The second sign should occur in the next multiple of 3 after year 2, which is year 3.
3. The third sign should occur in the next multiple of 4 after year 3, which is year 4.

However, the given program's logic will not yield the correct result:
- For the first sign, `start_year` becomes 2.
- For the second sign, `start_year` should become 3, but the program calculates `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 6`, which is incorrect.
- For the third sign, the program will continue with the incorrect `start_year` value.

The correct logic should be to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`. This can be done using:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x]
```
This ensures that we find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in determining the next occurrence of each sign.
