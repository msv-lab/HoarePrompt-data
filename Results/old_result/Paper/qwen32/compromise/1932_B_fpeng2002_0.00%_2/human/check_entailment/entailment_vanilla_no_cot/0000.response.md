Let's analyze the given code and compare it with the problem requirements.

The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, which is the year when the apocalypse will happen according to the rules provided.

The algorithm for each test case is as follows:
1. Initialize `start_year` to 0.
2. For each sign, calculate the next occurrence year:
   - Increment `start_year` by 1 to ensure we start checking from the year after the previous sign occurred.
   - Find the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Update `start_year` to this multiple.
3. Print the final `start_year` for each test case.

However, there is a mistake in the line:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```

This line is intended to find the next occurrence year of the current sign after `start_year`, but it incorrectly calculates the next multiple. The correct way to find the next occurrence year is:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] - nums[x] + (start_year + 1) % nums[x] + 1
```
or more simply:
```python
start_year += nums[x] - (start_year % nums[x]) if start_year % nums[x] != 0 else 0
start_year += nums[x]
```

But a more straightforward approach is:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x] + nums[x]
```

However, the given code can be simplified and corrected as follows:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x] + nums[x]
```

The provided code does not correctly compute the next occurrence year, leading to incorrect results.

Let's correct the code and check the correctness:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x] + nums[x]
        print(start_year)

# The corrected version of the code
```

Given the above analysis, the original provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
