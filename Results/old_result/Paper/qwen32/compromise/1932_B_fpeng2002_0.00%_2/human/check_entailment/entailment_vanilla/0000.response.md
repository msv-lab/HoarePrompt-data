Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` signs, each occurring every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur in a year after the previous one.
- We need to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, and thus the apocalypse happens.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Year of the N-th Sign:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign (in a loop), it calculates the next occurrence of the sign:
     - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1` calculates the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year.
   - This process is repeated for all `n` signs.

### Correctness Check:
- **Initialization:** `start_year` is initialized to 0, which makes sense as we start counting from year 0.
- **Loop Logic:** For each sign, the program correctly calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.
- **Output:** The final `start_year` after processing all signs is printed, which is the year the `n`-th sign occurs.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the first example from the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**
- `start_year = 0`
- First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- Second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
- Third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
- Fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
- Fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
- Sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

**Output:**
```
36
```

This matches the expected output, so the program works correctly for this test case.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and verifying it with the example provided, the program appears to correctly determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

**Correctness: True**
