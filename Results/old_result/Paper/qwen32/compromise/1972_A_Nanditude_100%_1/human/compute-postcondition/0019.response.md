The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is increased by 1.**
