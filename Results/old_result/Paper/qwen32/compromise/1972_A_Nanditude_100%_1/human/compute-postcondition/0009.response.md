The code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `cnt` is initially 0, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, and `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.**
