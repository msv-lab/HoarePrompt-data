The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user
- `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9)
- `j` is incremented by 1

After executing `cnt += 1`, the value of `cnt` is increased by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `j` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is increased by 1**
