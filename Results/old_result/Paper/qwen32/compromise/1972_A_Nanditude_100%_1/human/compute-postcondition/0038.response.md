Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1 and `cnt` is 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` (initially `i` was 0), otherwise `cnt` is 0. `j` is incremented by 1.**
