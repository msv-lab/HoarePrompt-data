To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the roles of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- **t**: This variable is mentioned but its value is not specified. It does not affect the `cnt` variable.
- **n**: This is an integer input by the user. It represents the number of elements in the lists `a` and `b`.
- **a**: This is a list of integers input by the user. It contains `n` elements.
- **b**: This is another list of integers input by the user. It also contains `n` elements.
- **cnt**: This variable holds the total number of times an element in list `b` is less than the current element in list `a`.
- **i**: This variable indicates the number of elements in list `a` that have been fully compared with all elements in list `b`. It ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
- **j**: This variable is set to `n`, the number of elements in the lists.

### Analysis:
The variable `cnt` is incremented each time an element in list `b` is found to be less than the current element in list `a` during the comparison process. Since the exact elements of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe `cnt` in terms of the comparison logic described.

### Conclusion:
The `print(cnt)` statement will output the total count of occurrences where an element in list `b` is less than the corresponding element in list `a` after all comparisons are done.

### Final Output:
Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total number of times an element in list b is less than the corresponding element in list a)**
