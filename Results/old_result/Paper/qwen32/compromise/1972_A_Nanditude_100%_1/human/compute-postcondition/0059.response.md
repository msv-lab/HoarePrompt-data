The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers input by the user, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 0, and `cnt` is either 0 or 1.**
