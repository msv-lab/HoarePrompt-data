The code snippet provided increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and the condition `b[j] < a[i]`) are not affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, and `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`**.
