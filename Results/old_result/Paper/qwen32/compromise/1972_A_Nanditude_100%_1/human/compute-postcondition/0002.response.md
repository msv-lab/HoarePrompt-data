The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, but after the execution of the code, the value of `n` will be whatever integer is input by the user, still constrained by the condition that it must be between 1 and 100.

Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of length `n` (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of length `n` (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9)**
