The code snippet provided overwrites the existing list `a` with a new list of integers obtained from the user input. The other variables `t`, `n`, and the original list `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of length `n` (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9)**.
