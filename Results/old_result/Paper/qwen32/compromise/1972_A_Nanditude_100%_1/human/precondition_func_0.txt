Each test case consists of three parts: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems, a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9) representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The function should handle up to 100 test cases.
