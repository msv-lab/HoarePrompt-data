The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `data`. The variables `t`, `times`, and `check` remain unchanged. The variable `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not used in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `times` is greater than or equal to 1, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
