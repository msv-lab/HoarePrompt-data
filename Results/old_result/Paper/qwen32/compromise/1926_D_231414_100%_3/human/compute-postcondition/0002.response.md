The only variable in the loop head is `times`, as the loop iterates `_` times, which is a throwaway variable. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, the variable `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `check` is 2147483647. However, these variables do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `times`.

To ensure the loop executes, `times` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `times` is the only variable we can adjust in the loop head, we set `times` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `times` must be greater than or equal to 1, `check` is 2147483647**
