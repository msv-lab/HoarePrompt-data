Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 from the previous state, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `max` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `max` is updated to be the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous states.
