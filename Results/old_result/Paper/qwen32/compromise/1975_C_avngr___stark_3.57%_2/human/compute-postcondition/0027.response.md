Postcondition: **`t` is decremented by 1 from the previous state, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` if that value is greater than the original `max`; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
