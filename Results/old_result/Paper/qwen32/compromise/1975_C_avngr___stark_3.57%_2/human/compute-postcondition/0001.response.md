In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `_` and the range function's argument `t`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't affect the loop's execution, we only need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to run.

Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This means that `t` is already in a valid state to ensure the loop will execute at least once (since the minimum value of `t` is 1).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state before the loop starts is already sufficient.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500**
