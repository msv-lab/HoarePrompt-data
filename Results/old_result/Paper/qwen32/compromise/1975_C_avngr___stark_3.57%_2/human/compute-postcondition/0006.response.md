Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max` is updated to a value less than the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, where `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are elements of the list `a` and `min(a[i], a[i - 1])` is greater than the previous value of `max`.**
