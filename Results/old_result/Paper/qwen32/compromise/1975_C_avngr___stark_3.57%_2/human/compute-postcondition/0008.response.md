Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
