Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, followed by a list of `n` integers `a` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
            max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is the maximum value among all the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is decremented by `n-1` from the previous state, `n` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, and `max` is the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is incremented by `n-2`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input list of integers, and `max` is the maximum value among all the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
