The function `func_1` processes a tree structure to calculate and return the number of "good components" and the remaining size of the component starting from a specified vertex `s`. A "good component" is defined as a connected sub-component with a size of at least `x`. The function updates each vertex in the tree with the count of good components and the remaining size of its sub-components.
