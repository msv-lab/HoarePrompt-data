Output State: **`postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)` where `u` is the last child of `v`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `postorder` is still not empty, `v` and `postorder` maintain their roles as described, `stack` structure remains the same, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated by adding `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated by adding `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
