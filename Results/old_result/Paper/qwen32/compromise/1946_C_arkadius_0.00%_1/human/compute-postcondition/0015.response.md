Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of vertices and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed from a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges based on the input. The tree is then rooted at node 0. The function computes and prints a value or structure derived from the tree after potentially removing `k` edges, as determined by the function `func_4`.**
