Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure with vertices attribute, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `stack` is `[(s, False)]`.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute. If `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v]` has processed all its children, `stack` remains `[]`, `v` is `s`, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. Each child `u` of `tree.vertices[v]` has contributed to `tree.vertices[v].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` based on the conditions provided. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, False), (u2, False), ..., (un, False)]` where `u1, u2, ..., un` are the children of `vertices[s]`, and `v` is `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute. If `postorder` is `True`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the initial value plus the sum of `good_components` of all children plus the count of children with `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the initial value plus the sum of `remaining_size` of all children with `remaining_size` less than `x`. If `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, True)]` followed by `n` elements of the form `(u, False)` where `u` is each child of `u1`, and `v` remains `u1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` if `postorder` was initially empty. `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append if `postorder` was initially empty. `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children` if `postorder` was initially empty. The second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)` if `postorder` was initially empty. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have been fully processed if `postorder` was initially empty. If `postorder` is not empty, no changes are made to `stack` and the postcondition retains the initial state of `v` and `postorder`. If `postorder` was initially empty, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of the good components of all children of `v` plus 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all children of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
