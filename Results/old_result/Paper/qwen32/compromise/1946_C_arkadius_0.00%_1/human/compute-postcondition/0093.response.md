Output State: **`postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have been fully processed, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of the good components of all children of `v` plus 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all children of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `postorder` remains unchanged from its state before the loop started.
- `v` is still the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`.
- `postorder` is still the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before any append operations.
- `stack` still has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`.
- The second-to-last element of `stack` is still `(v, postorder)`.
- All children of `v` have been processed.
- `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to include the good components of all its children, plus one for each child whose `remaining_size` is at least `x`.
- `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to be the sum of the `remaining_size` of its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
