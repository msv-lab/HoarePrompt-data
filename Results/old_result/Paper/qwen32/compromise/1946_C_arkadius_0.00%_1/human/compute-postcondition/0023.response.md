Output State: **The program returns `good_components` which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size` which is 1 if the last `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise it is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values that were less than `x` up to the last child processed.**
