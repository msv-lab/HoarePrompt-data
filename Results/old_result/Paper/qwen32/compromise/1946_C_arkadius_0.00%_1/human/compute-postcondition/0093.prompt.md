Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `postorder` is not empty. If `postorder` was initially empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)` where `u` is the last child of `v`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have been fully processed. If `postorder` was not empty, no changes are made to `stack` and `v` and `postorder` retain their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)` where `u` is the last child of `v`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one more element that has not been processed, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not been processed yet. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `postorder` is not empty, `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` that has not been processed yet. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its original value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
