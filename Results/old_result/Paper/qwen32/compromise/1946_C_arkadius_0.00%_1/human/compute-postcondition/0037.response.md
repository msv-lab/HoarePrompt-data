The code snippet appends a tuple `(u, False)` to the `stack` list. This affects the `stack` variable, making it longer by one element. The other variables (`tree`, `v`, and `postorder`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute where `tree.vertices[u1].children` must have at least one element, `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, True), (u, False)]`, `v` is `u1`, `postorder` is `False`**.
