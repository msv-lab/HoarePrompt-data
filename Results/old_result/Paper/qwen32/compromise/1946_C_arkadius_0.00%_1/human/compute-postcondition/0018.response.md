Postcondition: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with `n` vertices, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^5\), `beg` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `end` is either `n`, `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, or `mid - 1` depending on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, and `mid` is recalculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True, then `end` is updated to be either `n`, `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, or `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `beg` is updated to be either `(beg + end + 1) // 2` or 1. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.**
