The code snippet adds an edge to the tree between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`. This operation modifies the structure of the tree but does not change the values of `n`, `u`, `v`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state retains the conditions that `n` must be greater than 4, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and `i` is 4. The only change is that an edge is added to the tree.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, an edge is added to the tree between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`, `i` is 4.**
