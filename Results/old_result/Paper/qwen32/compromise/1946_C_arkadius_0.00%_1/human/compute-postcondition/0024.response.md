Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `tree`, which is an object representing a tree structure with vertices that have children, a parameter `v`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the tree, and a parameter `x`, which is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of a connected component. The function calculates and returns two values: `good_components`, which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size`, which is 1 if the last `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise it is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values that were less than `x` up to the last child processed.**
