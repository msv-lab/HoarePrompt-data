The given loop is a binary search algorithm that adjusts the `beg` and `end` variables based on the result of the `func_3` function. The loop continues until `beg` is no longer less than `end`. The final state of `beg` will be the largest value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.

Given that the loop has executed 3 times, and we need to determine the state after all iterations are complete, we observe that the loop is narrowing down the range `[beg, end]` based on the results of `func_3`. The loop will terminate when `beg` is equal to `end`.

Let's analyze the possible final states:

- After each iteration, `mid` is recalculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.
- If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`, `beg` is set to `mid`.
- If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `False`, `end` is set to `mid - 1`.
- The loop continues until `beg` is no longer less than `end`.

The loop will stop when `beg` equals `end`, which means the final state will have `beg` and `end` with the same value. This value will be the largest `mid` for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`beg` equals `end`, and both represent the largest value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will stop when `beg` and `end` converge to the same value, which is the largest number of connected components that can be formed by removing `k` edges from the tree, as determined by the `func_3` function.
