The code snippet `beg = mid` assigns the current value of `mid` to `beg`. The other variables (`tree`, `n`, `k`, `end`) remain unchanged by this assignment. Since `mid` is recalculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2` before this assignment, the new value of `beg` will be the same as `mid`, which is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with `n` vertices, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^5\), `beg` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `end` is either `n`, `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, or `mid - 1` depending on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, `mid` is recalculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.**
