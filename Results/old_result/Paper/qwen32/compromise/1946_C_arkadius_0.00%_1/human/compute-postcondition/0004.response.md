The code snippet adds an edge to a tree data structure between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`. The values of `u` and `v` are integers read from the input. The value of `n` (which must be greater than 1) is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `u` and `v` are integers read from the input; an edge is added to the tree between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`.**
