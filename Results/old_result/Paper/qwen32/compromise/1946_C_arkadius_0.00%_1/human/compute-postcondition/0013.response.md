To determine what will be printed by the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to understand the context and the state of the program at the moment the statement executes. Here's the breakdown of the provided information:

- `n` remains unchanged. This means `n` is a constant or has a specific value that is not altered by any operations before this print statement.
- `k` remains unchanged. Similarly, `k` is a constant or has a specific value that is not altered by any operations before this print statement.
- `tree` has been processed with `root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)`, setting the root to node `0`. This implies that the `tree` data structure has been modified or initialized with the root node set to `0`.

The function `func_4` is called with the arguments `tree`, `n`, and `k`. To determine the output, we need to understand what `func_4` does. However, the implementation of `func_4` is not provided, so we can only infer the output based on the given information.

Given the lack of the implementation for `func_4`, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's behavior with the provided arguments.

Output: **func_4(tree, n, k) (where `tree` is the processed tree with root node 0, `n` is the unchanged value representing the number of nodes, and `k` is the unchanged value representing some parameter used by `func_4`)**
