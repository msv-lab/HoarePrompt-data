### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its annotations to assess its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Tree Rooting**:
   - The tree is rooted at vertex 0. The problem does not specify a particular root, and the algorithm should theoretically work for any root. However, the choice of the root can affect the traversal order. The provided code uses a non-recursive approach to root the tree, which should be correct.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem constraints state `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5`, so the program does not explicitly handle `n=1` or `k=0`. However, these cases are unlikely to occur based on the problem constraints. The program should handle the minimum `k` and `n` values correctly within the given constraints.

3. **Tree Construction**:
   - The tree is constructed using 0-based indexing, which is correct given the 1-based indexing in the input. This is handled correctly by the code.

4. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search implementation (`func_4`) is correct in terms of logic. It uses `func_3` to determine whether a given `x` is feasible. The binary search narrows down the maximum `x` efficiently.

5. **Handling of Remaining Size**:
   - The `func_1` and `func_2` functions handle the remaining size and good components correctly. They correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex in the tree.

#### Detailed Analysis of Functions:
- **`func_1` and `func_2`**:
  - Both functions traverse the tree and update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex. The annotations indicate that these functions correctly accumulate the values based on the children of each vertex.
  - The annotations for `func_1` and `func_2` match the intended behavior of the functions. They correctly handle the post-order traversal and accumulation of component sizes.

- **`func_3`**:
  - This function uses the results from `func_1` to determine if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
  - The annotations indicate that `func_3` correctly checks the conditions based on the values returned by `func_1`.

- **`func_4`**:
  - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` for which `func_3` returns `True`.
  - The annotations indicate that the binary search correctly narrows down the maximum `x`.

- **`func_5`**:
  - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and prints the result from `func_4`.
  - The annotations indicate that the tree is correctly constructed and rooted, and the result is printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The annotations provided match the intended behavior of the program. The program correctly handles the tree construction, rooting, and traversal. The binary search implementation is correct, and the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly determine the feasibility of a given `x`.

Given the thorough analysis and the match between the annotations and the intended behavior, the program appears to be correct for the given problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
