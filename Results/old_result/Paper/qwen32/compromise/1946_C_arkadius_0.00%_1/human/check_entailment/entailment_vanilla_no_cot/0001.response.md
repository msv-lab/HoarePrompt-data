To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a given tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

### Program Analysis
The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \). Here's a detailed breakdown of the functions:

1. **func_1 and func_2**:
   - Both functions perform a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate two values for each node: `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - `good_components` is the number of subtrees rooted at the node that have a size of at least \( x \).
   - `remaining_size` is the total size of all subtrees rooted at the node that have a size less than \( x \).

2. **func_3**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to achieve at least \( k \) good components with a minimum size of \( x \) by using the values computed by `func_1` or `func_2`.

3. **func_4**:
   - This function performs a binary search on the possible values of \( x \) (from 1 to \( n \)).
   - It uses `func_3` to check if a given \( x \) is feasible.
   - If \( x \) is feasible, it tries a larger value; otherwise, it tries a smaller value.

4. **func_5**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).

### Key Points to Consider
- **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed correctly from the input edges.
- **Tree Rooting**: The tree is rooted at an arbitrary node (node 0) using a non-recursive approach.
- **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` correctly narrows down the possible values of \( x \) based on the feasibility check in `func_3`.
- **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check in `func_3` correctly uses the values computed by `func_1` or `func_2` to determine if it is possible to have at least \( k \) components of size at least \( x \).

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It constructs the tree, roots it, and uses a binary search combined with a post-order traversal to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the conditions.

**Correctness: True**
