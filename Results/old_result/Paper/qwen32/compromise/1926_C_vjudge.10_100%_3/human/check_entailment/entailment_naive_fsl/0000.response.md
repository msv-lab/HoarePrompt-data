Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Function Definition and Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`. The function call should come after the function definition.

2. **Precomputation of Values**: The program precomputes the sum of digit sums for all integers from 1 to 2*10^5. This is done to optimize the solution, which is a good approach. However, the precomputation is done once for all test cases, which is correct, but the function call order issue needs to be resolved.

3. **Handling Large Inputs**: The program is supposed to handle up to 10^4 test cases, each with an input up to 2*10^5. The precomputation step ensures that each test case can be answered in constant time, which is efficient given the constraints. However, the function call order issue needs to be fixed.

4. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for computing the sum of digits and storing cumulative sums is correct. For each test case, it simply retrieves the precomputed value, which is efficient.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])

func_1()
```

After fixing the function call order, the program should work correctly for all test cases as described in the problem statement.
