The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `t`, which controls the number of iterations. Since `_` is not used in the loop body, we only need to adjust `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the number of remaining iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing, we need to ensure that `t` is still positive after decrementing.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `value` is an input integer.**
