The code snippet provided is `sum_value_digits += int(x)`. This line of code adds the integer value of `x` to `sum_value_digits`. However, the initial state does not define `x`, which means we cannot determine the exact new value of `sum_value_digits` without knowing `x`. We can only describe the state of the variables that are affected, assuming `x` is some integer value.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros; `i` is 1; `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits` + `int(x)`**

In natural language: The value of `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
