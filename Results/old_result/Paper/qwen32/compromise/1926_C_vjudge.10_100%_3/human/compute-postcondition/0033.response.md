To determine the final state of the loop after it executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables are updated.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = inf - 1` (which is 200000 in this case). For each iteration, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and updates the `values` list at index `i` to be the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

Given that `inf` is set to 200001, the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i = 200000`. The `values` list will be updated such that `values[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

The final state of the loop will be when `i` reaches 200000, and the `values` list will be fully populated up to `values[200000]`.

Here is the final output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for `1 ≤ i ≤ 200000`; `i` is 200001; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of 200000.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `values` list will contain the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 200000, and the loop variable `i` will be 200001, indicating that the loop has finished.
