To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).
- `value` is the new input integer.
- There is a list named `values`, but it is not explicitly defined in the initial state.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(values[value])
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet attempts to print the element at the index `value` in the list `values`.
- However, the list `values` is not defined in the initial state, which means we do not know its contents or its length.

### Output:
Given the provided information, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed because the list `values` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and the structure of the problem.

Output: **values[value] (where `values` is a list and `value` is the new input integer, and values[value] is the element at index `value` in the list `values`)**
