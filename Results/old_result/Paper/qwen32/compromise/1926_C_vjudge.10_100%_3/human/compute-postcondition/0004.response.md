The code snippet provided initializes a variable `sum_value_digits` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `inf`, `values`, `i`) are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros; `i` is 1; `sum_value_digits` is 0**.
