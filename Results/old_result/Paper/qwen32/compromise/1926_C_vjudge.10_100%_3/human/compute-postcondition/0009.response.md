The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how the loop progresses.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. The loop converts `i` to a string, which is `"2"`, and iterates over each character in this string. Since `"2"` has only one character, the loop will not execute again for `i = 2`.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to increment `i` so that `str(i)` has more than one character. The smallest such `i` is 10, because `str(10)` is `"10"`, which has two characters.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 10, and `x` should be the first character of `str(10)`, which is `"1"`.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros; `i` is 10; `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits` + `int(x)`; `x` is "1"**
