The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments the variable `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Given that `x` is "1", `int(x)` evaluates to 1. Therefore, `sum_value_digits` is incremented by 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros; `i` is 10; `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits` + 1; `x` is "1"**
