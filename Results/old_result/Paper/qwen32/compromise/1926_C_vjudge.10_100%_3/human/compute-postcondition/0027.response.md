The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the iterable `str(i)`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is currently 11, the string representation of `i` is `"11"`. The loop has already processed the first character `'1'` (which is assigned to `x`), so now it needs to process the second character `'1'`.

Here's the step-by-step adjustment needed:

1. The loop variable `x` needs to be updated to the next character in the string representation of `i`.
2. The iterable `str(i)` remains the same, as it is the string representation of the integer `i`.

Given that the loop has already processed the first character `'1'`, the next character to be processed is the second `'1'`. Therefore, `x` should be updated to `'1'`.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`; `x` is `'1'`**
