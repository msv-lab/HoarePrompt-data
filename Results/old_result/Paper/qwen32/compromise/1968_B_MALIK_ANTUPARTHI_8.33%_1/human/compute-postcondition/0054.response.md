Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `i + 2`; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` is `j + 1`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
