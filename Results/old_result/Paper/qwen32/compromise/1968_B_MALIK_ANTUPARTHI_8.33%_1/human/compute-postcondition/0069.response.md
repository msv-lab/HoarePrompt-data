The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`** should be adjusted to reflect that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 2`** (since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration, and it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration).

However, to clearly show the next value of `i`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`** (where `i` from the previous state is now `i + 1` from the start of the new iteration).

To make it more explicit:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

Since we need to specify the exact value of `i`:
If at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `x`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` will be `x + 1`.

So, the final state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`** (where `i` is the incremented value from the previous iteration).

Thus, the correct state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`** (where `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous state).

For clarity, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

So the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration `i` will be `i + 2`.

So the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 2`**.

However, to clearly show the next value of `i`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`** (where `i` from the previous state is now `i + 1` from the start of the new iteration).

So the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Therefore, the correct state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b - 1`; `k` is `b`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `b -
