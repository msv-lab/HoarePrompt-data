The code snippet `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` assigns the value of `k` based on the index of the character `d[j]` in the string `e`, incremented by 1. Here, `j` is `i + 3`, and `i` is `i + 1`, so `j` is effectively `i + 4` from the initial state of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `i + 3`; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`**.
