Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` and `a` are integers obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in the substring `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, and if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 1. In either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
