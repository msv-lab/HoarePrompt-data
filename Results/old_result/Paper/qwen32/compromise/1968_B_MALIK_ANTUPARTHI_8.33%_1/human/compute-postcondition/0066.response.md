Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `i` is `i + 1`; `j` is `i + 3`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, and if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `i + 3`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
