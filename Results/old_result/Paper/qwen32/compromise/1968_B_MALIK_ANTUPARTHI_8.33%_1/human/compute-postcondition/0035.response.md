The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `a` is a constant that does not change.

Given that the loop is using `range(a)`, `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` and `a` are integers obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `j` is `b - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise the value of `j` where the loop breaks; `k` is the value that caused the loop to break, which could be `j + 1`, `c`, or the index of the character in `e` plus 1; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state of `i` as `i` being incremented by 1. If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
