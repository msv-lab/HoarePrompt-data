The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` is at least 1 because `j` will iterate from 0 to `b-1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `a`, `d`, `e`, and `k`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

To ensure the loop executes, `b` must be greater than 0. The value of `j` before the loop starts does not affect the loop's execution, but we can set it to 0, as that is the value it will take in the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` and `a` are integers obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `k` is 0; `j` is 0**
