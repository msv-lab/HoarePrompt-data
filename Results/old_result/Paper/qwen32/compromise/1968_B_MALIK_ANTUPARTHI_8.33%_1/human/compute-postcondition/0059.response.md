In the given task, the loop is defined as `for j in range(b):`, which means the loop variable `j` will iterate from `0` to `b-1`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is provided, and we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, focusing only on the loop variable `j` and the loop range `b`.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5
- `b` is an integer greater than 0
- `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1
- `d` and `e` are the new input strings
- `j` is `i + 2`
- `i` is `i + 1`

However, the specific values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i` are not relevant to the loop variable `j` and the loop range `b`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` is the loop variable in `range(b)`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `i + 3`.

Since `b` is the upper limit of the loop and it does not change, we do not need to adjust `b`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are the new input strings; `j` is `i + 3`; `i` is `i + 1`**
