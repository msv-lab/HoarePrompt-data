The code snippet `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` updates the value of `k` based on the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the string `e`, incremented by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged except for `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the new input string, `j` is 0, `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `e` is the value of the input, and `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`.**
