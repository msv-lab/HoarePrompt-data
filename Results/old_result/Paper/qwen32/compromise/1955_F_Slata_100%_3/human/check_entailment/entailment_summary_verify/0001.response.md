To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The key to solving this problem is to ensure that the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position (LSB and 2nd LSB) remain even after Eve's removals.

### Observations
- **XOR of Sequence**: The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
- **Number Contributions**:
  - Number 1: Binary `01` (contributes 1 to LSB, 0 to 2nd LSB)
  - Number 2: Binary `10` (contributes 0 to LSB, 1 to 2nd LSB)
  - Number 3: Binary `11` (contributes 1 to LSB, 1 to 2nd LSB)
  - Number 4: Binary `00` (contributes 0 to LSB, 0 to 2nd LSB)

### Strategy
- **Pairs**: Each pair of numbers of the same type will not change the parity of the counts of 1s in the bit positions.
- **Odd Counts**: If there is an odd count of 1s, 2s, and 3s, removing one of each will result in an even count for all bit positions, making the XOR zero.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

- **`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`**: This counts the number of pairs for each number type. Each pair ensures that the count of that number type remains even after removal.
- **`int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`**: This checks if there is an odd count of 1s, 2s, and 3s. If so, it means that after removing pairs, there will be one of each type left, and removing one of each will result in an XOR of zero.

### Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Pairs: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 0`
   - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3` is True, so `int(True) = 1`
   - Total: `0 + 1 = 1`
   - **Correct**: Bob wins once.

2. **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Pairs: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3` is False, so `int(False) = 0`
   - Total: `1 + 0 = 1`
   - **Correct**: Bob wins once.

3. **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Pairs: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3` is False, so `int(False) = 0`
   - Total: `3 + 0 = 3`
   - **Correct**: Bob wins three times.

4. **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Pairs: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3` is True, so `int(True) = 1`
   - Total: `3 + 1 = 4`
   - **Incorrect**: Bob wins three times, not four. The correct logic should exclude the case where all three are odd and one of each is removed, which doesn't necessarily lead to another win.

5. **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Pairs: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
   - Odd counts: `0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3` is True, so `int(True) = 1`
   - Total: `12 + 1 = 13`
   - **Incorrect**: Bob wins twelve times, not thirteen. The correct logic should exclude the case where all three are odd and one of each is removed, which doesn't necessarily lead to another win.

### Conclusion

The program's logic for counting pairs is correct, but the additional condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` is incorrect. It incorrectly adds an extra win when it should not. The correct approach should be to consider the parity of the counts and ensure that Eve can always make the XOR zero by removing numbers optimally.

**Final Evaluation: False**

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the condition for adding an extra win when all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd.
