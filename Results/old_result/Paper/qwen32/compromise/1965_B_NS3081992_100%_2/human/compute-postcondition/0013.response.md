The code snippet calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` and assigns it to the variable `lk`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `ans` remain unchanged. 

Since `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, and `bk` is the binary representation of `k`, `lk` will be the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is an empty list; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`.**
