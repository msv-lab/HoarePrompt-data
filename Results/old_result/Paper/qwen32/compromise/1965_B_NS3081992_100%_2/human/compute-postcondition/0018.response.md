The code snippet appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`, and the initial elements of `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` now includes an additional element at the end, which is `2 * k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, `ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(l-1), k - 2^l, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.**
