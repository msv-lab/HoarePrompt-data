Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k`. It then computes a sequence for each test case according to the following logic:

#### Key Functions
- `func_14()`: This function is responsible for generating the required sequence for a given pair `(n, k)`.
- `func_15()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_14()` for each test case and printing the result.

#### Logic in `func_14()`
1. **Binary Representation**: The function first converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
2. **Special Case `k == 1`**:
   - If `n == 2`, it simply returns `[2]`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` minus 2.
3. **General Case `k > 1`**:
   - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
   - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Finally, it adds powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Correctness Check
To confirm the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that:
1. The sequence does not contain a subsequence that sums to `k`.
2. Every integer `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`) can be formed as a sum of a subsequence of the sequence.

#### Special Case `k == 1`
- If `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` correctly avoids `k = 1` and can form `2`.
- For `n > 2`, the sequence `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 ensures that no subsequence sums to `1` (since the smallest element is `2`), and all sums from `2` to `n` can be formed.

#### General Case `k > 1`
- The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1, ensuring that all sums up to `k-1` can be formed.
- The additional elements `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` ensure that the sequence avoids summing to `k` while still allowing the formation of all sums up to `n` except `k`.
- The final powers of 2 ensure that all sums up to `n` can be formed.

### Conclusion
The program correctly generates a sequence that satisfies the conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
