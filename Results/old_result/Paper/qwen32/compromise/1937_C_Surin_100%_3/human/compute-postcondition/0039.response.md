The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `prev`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, and `r` is `'='`**.
