Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<`. If no such input was received, `v1` is 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `r` is the new user input.
- `r2` is the new user input if `r` is `'='`. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is `n-1`. If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, if `r` is not `'='` or `r2` is not `'<'`, `prev` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`v1`**: This is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<`. If no such input was received, `v1` is 0.
2. **`i`**: This is explicitly given as `n`.
3. **`prev`**: The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r` and `r2`:
   - If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `n-1`.
   - If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

Since no specific values for `r` and `r2` are provided, we must consider the possible values of `prev` based on the conditions:
- If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` will be `n-1`.
- If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` will be `n-1`.
- For all other cases, `prev` will be 0.

### Output:
Given the format of the print statement, the output will be:
- `? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}`

Where:
- `{v1}` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or 0 if no such input was received.
- `{i}` is `n`.
- `{prev}` is `n-1` if `r` is `'>'` or if `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise it is 0.

Since `v1` and `prev` depend on user inputs `r` and `r2`, which are not specified, we cannot provide exact numerical values for them. However, we can describe their possible values.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [v1] [n] [v1] [prev] (where [v1] is the largest i for which the user input r was < or 0 if no such input was received, [n] is the value of n, and [prev] is n-1 if r is '>' or if r is '=' and r2 is '<', otherwise [prev] is 0)**
