Postcondition: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<', `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input value, `prev` remains unchanged unless `r` is '=', `r2` is an input value, and if `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<', then `prev` is set to 3.**
