The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`, the next value of `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Here is the adjusted state:
State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 2**
