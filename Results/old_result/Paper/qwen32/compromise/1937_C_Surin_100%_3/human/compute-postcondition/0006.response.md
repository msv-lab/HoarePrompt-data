The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` will generate numbers from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts as `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, the only variable we need to adjust for the loop to execute is `n`. The values of `kp`, `g`, and `v1` do not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0**
