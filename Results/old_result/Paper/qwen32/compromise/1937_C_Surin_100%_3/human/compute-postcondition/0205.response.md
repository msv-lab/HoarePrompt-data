Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<'.
- `i` is 3.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is an input value.
- `prev` remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is a formatted string that includes the value of `i` twice and the value of `prev` twice.
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is 3.
- The value of `prev` is not explicitly provided, but we know it remains unchanged. Since it's not given any specific value, we can denote it as `prev` in the output description.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'? 3 3 prev prev'` where `prev` is the unchanged value of `prev`.

Output: **? 3 3 prev prev (where prev is the unchanged value of prev)**
