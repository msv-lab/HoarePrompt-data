The code snippet provided initializes the variable `prev` to 0. None of the other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0**.
