The provided code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` operation, the output state is identical to the initial state.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 2, `r` is the input string.**
