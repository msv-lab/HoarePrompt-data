The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 3, `r` is the input string**
