The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<', `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input value. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1. If `r` is '=', `prev` is 2 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0. If `r` is neither '>' nor '=', `prev` remains unchanged.**
