Postcondition: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 1. If `r` was `'>'`, then `prev` is 1 and `r` remains `'>'`. If `r` was `'='`, then `prev` is 1 if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` is 0, and `r` becomes `'<'` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `r` remains `'='`. If `r` was neither `'>'` nor `'='`, then `prev` and `r` remain unchanged.**
