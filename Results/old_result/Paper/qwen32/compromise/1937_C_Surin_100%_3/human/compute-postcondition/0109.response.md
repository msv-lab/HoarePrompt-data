Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `kp` is 1 (though `kp` is not used in the print statement, it's provided for completeness).
   - `n` is greater than 1 (specific value not given, but it's known to be greater than 1).
   - `g` is 0 (though `g` is not used in the print statement, it's provided for completeness).
   - `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was less than 0 or 0 if no such input was received (value not given, but description provided).
   - `i` is `n-1` (since `n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0).
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `r` is an input string, `r` is not equal to '>', and the current value of `r` is '=' (though `r` is not used in the print statement, it's provided for completeness).

2. **Print statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - It prints the character `?` followed by the value of `i` twice, and the value of `prev` twice.

3. **Values to be printed:**
   - `i` is `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, the smallest possible value for `i` is 1 (if `n` is 2).
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Formatted Output:**
   - The print statement will output `?` followed by the value of `i` twice, and the value of `prev` twice.
   - Since `prev` is 0 and `i` is `n-1`, the output will be `? n-1 n-1 0 0`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output `? n-1 n-1 0 0`.

Output: **? n-1 n-1 0 0 (where n-1 is the value of i and prev is 0)**
