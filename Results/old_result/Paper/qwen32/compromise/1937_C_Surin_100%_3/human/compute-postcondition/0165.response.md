Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `kp` is set to 2.
   - `n` is greater than 1 (the exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is known to be greater than 1).
   - `g` is set to 0.
   - `v1` is set to `n`.
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.
   - `prev` is determined by a loop based on user inputs `r` and `r2`, but the exact value is not specified in the initial state.
   - `v2` is set to `n-1`.
   - `r` is the value provided by user input. If `r` is equal to '<', the conditions on the variables remain unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')`

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `v1` is explicitly set to `n`.
   - `v2` is explicitly set to `n-1`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `v1` is `n` and `v2` is `n-1`, the print statement will output the formatted string with these values.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:
Output: **? n n n-1 n-1 (where n is a value greater than 1)**
