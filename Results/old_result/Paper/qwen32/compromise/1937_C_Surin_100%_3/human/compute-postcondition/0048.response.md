The provided code snippet includes `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a function call that flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not change the values of any variables or alter the state of the program in terms of variable values or conditions. Therefore, no variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 2.**
