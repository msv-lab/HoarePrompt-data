Let's break down the given information and determine the values of the variables that will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<'.
- `i` is 2.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is an input value. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1. If `r` is '=', `prev` is 1 if `r2` is '<', otherwise `prev` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`v1`**: This is described as the largest `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if `r` was never '<'. Since there is no information provided about `r` being '<' at any point, we assume `v1` is 0.
2. **`i`**: This is explicitly given as 2.
3. **`prev`**: The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r` and `r2`. Since there is no information about `r` being '>' or '=' and `r2` being '<', we assume `prev` remains 0.

### Conclusion:
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `prev` is 0.

### Output:
The print statement will output `? 0 2 0 0`.

Output: **? 0 2 0 0**
