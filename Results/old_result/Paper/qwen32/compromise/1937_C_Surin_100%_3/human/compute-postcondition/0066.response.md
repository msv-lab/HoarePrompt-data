The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3. Therefore, `prev` will take the value of 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 3, `r` is the new input string, `r2` is the new input string, `prev` is 3**.
