Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `kp` is 0
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations
- `i` is 2
- `r` is an input string

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

From the initial state, we know the values of some variables:
- `i` is 2

However, the variable `prev` is not defined in the initial state. Since `prev` is not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its value based on the information provided. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific value for `prev`.

Given that `prev` is not defined, we can only describe the output in terms of `prev`.

Output: **? 2 2 prev prev (where prev is the value of the variable prev)**
