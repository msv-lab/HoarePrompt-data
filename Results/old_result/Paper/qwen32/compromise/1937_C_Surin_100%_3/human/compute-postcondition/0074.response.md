Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the final value updated based on the responses `r` and `r2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by this line of code.
