The value of `v2` is updated to be equal to `i`. The other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `i`, `r`, and `v1` if applicable) remain unchanged. Given that `v2` was initially `i + 2`, it is now reassigned to `i`.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `g` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is an input string. If `r` equals `<`, then `v1` is `i + 2`.**
