The provided `print` statement is `print(2)`, which directly prints the integer value `2`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but they do not influence the execution of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `string`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `x`, `i`, `count`, `count2`, and `done` as it only outputs the constant integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the number `2`.

Output: **2**
