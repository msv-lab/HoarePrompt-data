To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `string`: The input string.
- `n`: The length of the `string` (at least 1).
- `j`: Initially set to 1.
- `s`: A list of characters from `string`.
- `x`: The first character of `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
- `count2`: Not explicitly used in the provided code snippet.
- `count`: Initially not set, but it gets set to `j` if certain conditions are met.
- `done`: A boolean flag initially not set, but it gets set to `True` if certain conditions are met.

### Code Execution:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Let's analyze what happens:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `j` starts at 1.
   - `x` is `s[0]`, which is the first character of the `string`.

2. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop or condition checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and if `count` is less than 1. If true, `count` is set to `j`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.
   - The loop or condition also checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If true, `done` is set to `True`, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - `string[:j - 1]` will print the substring from the start of `string` up to, but not including, the `j-1` index.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will print the substring from the `j-1` index to the end of the `string`.

Given that `j` starts at 1, the initial print statement will be:
   - `string[:j - 1]` = `string[:0]` = `""` (an empty string).
   - `string[j - 1:]` = `string[0:]` = `string` (the entire string).

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output an empty string followed by the entire input string.

Output: **"" [string] (where [string] is the input string)**
