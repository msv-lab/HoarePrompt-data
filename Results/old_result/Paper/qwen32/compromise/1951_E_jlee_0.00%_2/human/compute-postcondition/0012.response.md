Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and conditions:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `string` is the input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- If `n` equals 1, `done` remains False. Otherwise, the state of `done` is unchanged.
- `x` is the first character of `string` and `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`.

The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, or `x` directly. It simply prints 'YES'.

Therefore, regardless of the specific values of the variables, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
