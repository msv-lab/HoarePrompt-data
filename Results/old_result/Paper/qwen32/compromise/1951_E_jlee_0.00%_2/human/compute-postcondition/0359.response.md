Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `count` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` and `done` is set to `True` if `count2` is less than `count` or `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is incremented by 1. The state of `count` and `done` remains unchanged if `s[j]` is equal to `x`.**
