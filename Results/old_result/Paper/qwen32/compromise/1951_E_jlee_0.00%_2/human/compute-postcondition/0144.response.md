Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `string` is the input string with at least 1 character, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is 2. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count`, `count2` is set to 0 if `count` was not greater than 1, and `done` is set to True if `count` was greater than 1. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged. If `count` is not greater than 0, `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged.**
