Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4 (not directly used in the print statement).
   - `string`: The input string with at least 1 character.
   - `s`: A list of characters from `string`.
   - `n`: The length of `s` (and `string`), which is at least 1.
   - `x`: The first character of `string`.
   - `count2`: Equal to `count`.
   - `j`: Initially 0, but it is set to a value where `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `count`: Greater than 1, indicating that there exists a `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Key points about `j`:**
   - `j` is set to the first index where `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `count` is the value of `j` when `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.

3. **Print statement:**
   - `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`
   - This splits the string into two parts:
     - The first part is from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
     - The second part is from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

4. **What gets printed:**
   - `string[:j - 1]`: This part of the string includes all characters from the start up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
   - `string[j - 1:]`: This part of the string includes the character at index `j - 1` and all subsequent characters up to the end of the string.

5. **Example to illustrate:**
   - Suppose `string` is "aabbc".
   - `x` is 'a'.
   - `j` is 2, because `s[2]` ('b') is not equal to 'a'.
   - `string[:j - 1]` is `string[:1]` which is "a".
   - `string[j - 1:]` is `string[1:]` which is "abbc".

Given this understanding, the print statement will output the first part of the string up to `j - 1` and the second part from `j - 1` to the end.

Output: **string[:j - 1] string[j - 1:] (where string[:j - 1] is the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index j - 1, and string[j - 1:] is the substring from the character at index j - 1 to the end of the string)**
