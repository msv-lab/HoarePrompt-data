Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for our output.)
2. `string` is the input string.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
4. `n` is the length of `s`.
5. `s.count(x) == n`, meaning all characters in `s` are the same as the first character `x`.
6. If `n` equals 1, `done` remains False. Otherwise, the state of `done` is unchanged. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for our output.)
7. `x` is the first character of `string` and `x` is equal to every other character in `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('NO')` directly outputs the string `'NO'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`) are used in the print statement. Therefore, the output will be the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
