Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count2` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` and `done` is set to `True`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `count` remains unchanged.**
