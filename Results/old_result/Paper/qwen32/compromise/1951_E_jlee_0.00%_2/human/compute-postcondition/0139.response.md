Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `string` is the input string with at least 1 character, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is 2. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged.**
