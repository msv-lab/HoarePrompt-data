Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `string` is the input string.
2. `n` is at least 1.
3. `j` is 0.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `x` is `s[0]`, which is the first character of the string.
6. `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not used in the provided code snippet, so its value is irrelevant here.
7. There are conditions involving `count`, `count2`, and `done`, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the variables and conditions in the program, but these variables and conditions do not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `string`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **YES**
