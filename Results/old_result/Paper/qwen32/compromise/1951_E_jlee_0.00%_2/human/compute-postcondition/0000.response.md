The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with length 1 <= |`s`| <= 10^6. The sum of lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
