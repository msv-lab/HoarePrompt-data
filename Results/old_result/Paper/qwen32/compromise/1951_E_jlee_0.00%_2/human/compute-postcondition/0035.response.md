Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string with at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `done` is False if `n` equals 1, otherwise its state is unchanged; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `j` is 0; the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of `s`.**
