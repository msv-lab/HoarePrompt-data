Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
   - `string` is the input string. This is the primary variable of interest for the print statement.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`. This is essentially the string `string` converted into a list of its individual characters.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, which is the same as the length of `string`.
   - `done` is a boolean variable that remains `False` if `n` equals 1, otherwise its state is unchanged. This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
   - `x` is the first character of `string` and `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`. This condition ensures that the first and last characters of the string are different.

2. **The print statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(string)`. This means it will output the value of the `string` variable.

3. **Output:**
   - Since the print statement directly outputs the `string` variable, the output will be exactly the input string provided.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is the input string `string`.

Output: **string (where string is the input string)**
