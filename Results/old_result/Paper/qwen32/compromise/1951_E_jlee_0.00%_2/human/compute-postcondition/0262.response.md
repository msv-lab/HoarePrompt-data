Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `string` is a newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of the newly input string.
- `j` is initialized to 2.
- `count` is set to 2 if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0.
- `done` is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise it remains False.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the innermost loop or if statement is exited.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print('YES')` statement is independent of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, and `done`. The print statement will execute regardless of the conditions and values of these variables, as it is a standalone statement that simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
