You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `n` iterations, and for each iteration, it has printed `3`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state; `l` remains unchanged from its initial state for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it prints `2` if it is possible to rearrange the list `p` such that for each index `i`, `p_i` is not equal to `i` after a certain number of operations, otherwise it prints `3`. The function does not return a value; it only outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Invitation Count**:
   - The code checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` which is not the correct condition to determine if two friends can come to the party.
   - It prints `2` when it finds a friend whose best friend is also their best friend, which is not a valid condition according to the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Handling of All Cases**:
   - The code assumes that if the above condition is not met, it should print `3`. However, this is not always correct.
   - The correct approach involves finding the smallest set of friends that can invite each other in pairs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the smallest set of friends such that each invited friend's best friend is also invited. This can be done by finding cycles in the graph formed by the best friend relationships.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```
- According to the problem, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party because 1's best friend is 2 and 2's best friend is 3, and 3's best friend is 4, and 4's best friend is 1. So, inviting 1 and 2 will make 1 and 2 come to the party.
- The program will not handle this case correctly and might print `3` instead of `2`.

### Correct Solution:
To find the correct solution, we can use a graph traversal approach to find the smallest set of friends that can invite each other in pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        visited = [False] * n
        min_invitations = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                cycle_length = 0
                x = i
                while not visited[x]:
                    visited[x] = True
                    x = p[x] - 1
                    cycle_length += 1
                if cycle_length == 1:
                    min_invitations += 1
                else:
                    min_invitations += (cycle_length + 1) // 2
        results.append(min_invitations)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.
