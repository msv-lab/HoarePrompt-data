The code snippet `x = int(input())` assigns a new value to `x` based on the input provided. This means the previous value of `x` is replaced with the new integer value from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, and p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is the new input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is equal to the new x + 1. The loop prints 3.**
