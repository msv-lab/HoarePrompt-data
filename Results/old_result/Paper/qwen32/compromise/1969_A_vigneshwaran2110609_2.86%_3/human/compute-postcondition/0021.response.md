The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since `i` is the loop variable in `range(n)`), and `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is currently `x`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, and p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is equal to x + 1. The loop prints 3.**
