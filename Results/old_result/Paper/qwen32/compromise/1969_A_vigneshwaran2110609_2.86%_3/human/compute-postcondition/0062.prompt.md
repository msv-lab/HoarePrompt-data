Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, and p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is equal to x. The loop prints 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has completed all `x` iterations without finding any `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. Consequently, `flag` remains `False`, and the loop prints "3". The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `p`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state; `l` remains unchanged from its initial state; `i` is equal to `x`; `flag` remains unchanged if it was not set to `True` during the loop; the loop prints `3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
