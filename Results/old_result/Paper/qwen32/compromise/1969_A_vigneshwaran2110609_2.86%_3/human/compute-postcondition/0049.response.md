Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `p`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `x` is greater than 0. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
