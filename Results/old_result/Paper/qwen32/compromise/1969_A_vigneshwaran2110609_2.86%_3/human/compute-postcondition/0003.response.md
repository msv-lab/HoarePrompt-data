The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The initial state does not specify any information about the contents of the input, so we can only describe the list `l` in terms of its general properties after the code execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
