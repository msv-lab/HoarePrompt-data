Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, and p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1. If the element at index `l[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, `l`, or `i`.**
