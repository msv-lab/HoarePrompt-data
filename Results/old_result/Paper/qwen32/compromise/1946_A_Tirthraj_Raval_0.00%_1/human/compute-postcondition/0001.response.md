Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value read from the input. The conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are described in the precondition and have not yet been modified by the code snippet provided.
