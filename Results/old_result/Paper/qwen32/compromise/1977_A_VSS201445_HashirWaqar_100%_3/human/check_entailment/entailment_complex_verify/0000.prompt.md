You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t lines, each containing either "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` pairs of integers `n` and `m`. For each pair, it prints "YES" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and their difference `n - m` is even; otherwise, it prints "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikita can either add or remove one cube at a time. Given `n` moves, the goal is to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes. The program should output "Yes" if it's possible and "No" otherwise.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Conditions Breakdown:
1. **`n >= m`**: This condition ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as many as the number of cubes `m` needed. This is necessary because if `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes since each move can only add or remove one cube.
2. **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This condition ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes can be achieved through an even number of additions and subtractions. For example, if `n - m` is 4, it means we can add 2 cubes and remove 2 cubes, or add 4 cubes and remove 0 cubes, etc.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's consider a few cases to ensure the program's correctness:
1. **`n = 3`, `m = 3`**: The program will print "YES" because `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (3 - 3 = 0).
2. **`n = 2`, `m = 4`**: The program will print "NO" because `n < m`.
3. **`n = 5`, `m = 3`**: The program will print "YES" because `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (5 - 3 = 2).
4. **`n = 4`, `m = 1`**: The program will print "YES" because `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (4 - 1 = 3, but this is incorrect, it should be 3 which is odd, hence the correct check is `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`).

### Edge Cases:
1. **`n = 1`, `m = 1`**: The program will print "YES" because `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (1 - 1 = 0).
2. **`n = 1`, `m = 0`**: The program will print "YES" because `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (1 - 0 = 1, but this is incorrect, it should be 1 which is odd, hence the correct check is `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`).
3. **`n = 2`, `m = 0`**: The program will print "YES" because `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (2 - 0 = 2).
4. **`n = 2`, `m = 1`**: The program will print "YES" because `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (2 - 1 = 1, but this is incorrect, it should be 1 which is odd, hence the correct check is `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where `(n - m) % 2 != 0` correctly. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is necessary but not sufficient when `n < m`.

### Counterexample:
Consider `n = 2` and `m = 1`. The program will print "YES" because `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (2 - 1 = 1, but this is incorrect, it should be 1 which is odd, hence the correct check is `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle cases where `n < m` and `(n - m) % 2 != 0`.
