Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is `1`, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), and `l` is `[1, i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is greater than `k`, `l` remains `[1]`.**
