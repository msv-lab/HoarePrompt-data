The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It has no effect when not placed inside a loop. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the flow of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`) are changed. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.**
