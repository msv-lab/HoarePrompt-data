`k` is assigned the value of `x` integer divided by `n`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged. The output state is: `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`.**
