Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), and `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus `2` (if `i + 2` is less than or equal to `int(x)`). If `x % i == 0`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, and if `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the current value of `x // i`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i != 0`, no changes are made to `l` or `ans`.**
