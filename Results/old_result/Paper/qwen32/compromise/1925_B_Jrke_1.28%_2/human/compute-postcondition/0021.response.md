The given Python code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation. The value of `i` is also not changed by this operation, but it is now included in the list `l`.

Natural language explanation: The list `l` now contains all its previous elements plus the value of `i`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `ans` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 2, `l` is a list containing `ans` and `i`.**
