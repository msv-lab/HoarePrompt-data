Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input and is at least `1`, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `i <= k`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which now includes the new value of `i`, and `l` is a list containing the previous `ans` and the new value of `i`. Otherwise, `ans` and `l` remain unchanged.**
