Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. If `k == 1`, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.**
