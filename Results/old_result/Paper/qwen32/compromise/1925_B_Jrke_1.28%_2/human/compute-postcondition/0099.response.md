To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` in this case. The loop iterates over a range starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` with a step of `2`. This means `i` is incremented by `2` in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`
- `x` is at least `4`
- `n` is the second integer from the input
- `k` is `x // n`
- `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`
- `i` is `i_prev + 2` (where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration)

We need to adjust `i` to the next value in the range for the loop to execute again. Since the loop increments `i` by `2` each time, the new value of `i` should be `i + 2`.

Let's determine the starting value of `i` for the first iteration:
- If `x` is even, the loop starts at `2` (since `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` evaluates to `2`).
- If `x` is odd, the loop starts at `1`.

Since `x` is at least `4`, we need to consider the increment from the previous iteration. If `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 2`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least `4`, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is `i + 2`**
