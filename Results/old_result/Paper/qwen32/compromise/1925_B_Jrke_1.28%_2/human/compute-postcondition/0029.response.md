The code snippet `l.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `l`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not changed by this operation; it simply gets added to the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus `2` (if `i + 2` is less than or equal to `int(x)`), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and the current value of `i`.**
