The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Therefore, the list `l` now contains its previous elements plus the new element `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `l` is a list containing the previous values plus `i`.**
