The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the program's state. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and `k` equals 1.**
