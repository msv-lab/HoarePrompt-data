Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is `1`, `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x // i <= k`, then `l` is `[1, i, x // i]` if `i <= k` or `[1, x // i]` if `i > k`. Otherwise, `l` remains `[1, i]` if `i <= k` or `[1]` if `i > k`.**
