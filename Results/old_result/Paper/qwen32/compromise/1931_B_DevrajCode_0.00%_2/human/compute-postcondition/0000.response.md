The code snippet calculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within a certain range and `a` is a list of `n` integers with specific constraints on their values and the sum.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.**

In natural language: The value of `total_water` is now the sum of all elements in the list `a`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
