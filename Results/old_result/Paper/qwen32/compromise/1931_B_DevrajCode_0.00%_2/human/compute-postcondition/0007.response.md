Let's analyze the given loop and the initial state to determine the output state.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
   - The sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`.
   - `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `total_water % n` is equal to 0.
   - `target` is `total_water // n`.
   - `container` is 0.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `water` in the list `a`.
   - For each `water`, it updates `container` by adding `water - target`.
   - If at any point `container` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'No'.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - Since `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `target` is the average of the elements in `a`.
   - The loop essentially calculates the cumulative deviation from the average (`target`) for the elements in `a`.
   - If `container` ever becomes negative, it means that the cumulative sum of deviations has gone below zero, indicating an imbalance that cannot be corrected by the remaining elements in the list.

4. **Final State:**
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means that `container` never went below 0 during the iterations. This implies that the cumulative deviation from the average never went negative, which is possible only if the list `a` is such that the deviations balance out in a way that `container` remains non-negative throughout.
   - Since the sum of deviations from the mean (which is `total_water - n * target`) must be zero (because `total_water = n * target`), `container` will be 0 at the end of the loop.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

Output State: **container is 0.**
