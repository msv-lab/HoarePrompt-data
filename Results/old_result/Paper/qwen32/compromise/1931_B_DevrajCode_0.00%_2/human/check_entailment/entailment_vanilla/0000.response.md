### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have `n` containers, each containing `a_i` units of water.
   - The total amount of water is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from a container `i` to a container `j` only if `i < j`.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - Since the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water each container should have is `total_water // n`.
   - The problem can be reduced to checking if we can redistribute the water such that no container ever ends up with less water than the target amount during the redistribution process, given the constraint `i < j`.

3. **Solution Analysis:**
   - The solution calculates the `target` amount of water each container should have.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running balance (`container`) of the difference between the actual and target water levels.
   - If at any point the running balance becomes negative, it means there isn't enough water in the previous containers to meet the target for the current container, given the constraint `i < j`. Thus, it returns "No".
   - If the loop completes without the balance going negative, it returns "Yes".

4. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The solution correctly checks the feasibility of redistributing the water under the given constraints.
   - The running balance ensures that we never try to take water from a container that doesn't have enough water to meet the target for the current container, considering the direction of water flow (`i < j`).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
