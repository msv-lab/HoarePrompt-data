Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine if it is possible to redistribute the water in `n` containers such that each container has the same amount of water. The only allowed operation is to pour water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`. The sum of the water in all containers is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program reads all input at once and attempts to process it. It defines a function `func_1` that checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target water level ever goes negative. If it does, the function returns 'No', otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

### Function Summary Recap
The function `func_1` is supposed to return 'Yes' if it is possible to redistribute the water such that each container has the same amount, otherwise, 'No'.

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect due to:
1. Incorrect input handling.
2. Function definition order.
3. Incorrect logic for determining if redistribution is possible.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once, which is not incorrect per se, but it does not correctly parse multiple test cases. Each test case has its own `n` and `a_i` values, and the current implementation does not handle this correctly. However, this issue is not the primary reason for the program's incorrectness, as the logic within `func_1` is flawed.

2. **Function Definition Order**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is called, which will result in a `NameError`. This is a valid point and needs to be corrected.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**: The logic within `func_1` is flawed. The function checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target water level ever goes negative. This logic is incorrect because it does not fully capture the requirements of the problem. The correct approach is to ensure that the prefix sum of the differences is always non-negative, which is what the original logic attempts to do but fails to do correctly for all cases.

### Correctness of the Logic
The logic in `func_1` is fundamentally flawed. The key issue is that it does not correctly simulate the process of pouring water from one container to another. The correct approach would involve checking if it is possible to redistribute the water such that the prefix sum of the differences is always non-negative, but the current implementation does not fully ensure this.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with the logic in `func_1`, the program is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out these issues.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
