You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .
Function definition:
```
def func_1(n, a):
```
