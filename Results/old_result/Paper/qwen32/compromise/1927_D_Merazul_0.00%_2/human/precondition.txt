t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three elements: an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, a list a of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and an integer q such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. Additionally, each of the q queries is a tuple of two integers (l, r) such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
