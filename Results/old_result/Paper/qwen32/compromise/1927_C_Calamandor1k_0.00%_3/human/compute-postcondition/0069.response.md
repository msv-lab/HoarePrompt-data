The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should have `t` decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of the new list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the new list `b`; `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `d` is `k // 2`.**
