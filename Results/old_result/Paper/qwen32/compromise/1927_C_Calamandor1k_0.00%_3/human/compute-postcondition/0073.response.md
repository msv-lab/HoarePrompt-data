The given code snippet updates the values of `len_a` and `len_b` to the lengths of the lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of the list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the new list `b`; `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `count_b` is the number of elements in the new list `b` that are less than or equal to `k` (this count is not recalculated in the provided code); `d` is `k // 2`.**
