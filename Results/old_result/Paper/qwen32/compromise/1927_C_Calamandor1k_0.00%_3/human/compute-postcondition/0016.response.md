The code snippet `count_b += 1` increments the value of `count_b` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `count_b` is the previous value of `count_b` plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1; `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1; `count_a` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` remains 0; `count_b` is the previous value of `count_b` plus 1; `d` is `k // 2`. Additionally, `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, and `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`. The current value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
