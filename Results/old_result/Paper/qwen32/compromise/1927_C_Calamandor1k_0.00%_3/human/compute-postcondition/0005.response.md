Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`.**

In this output state, the variables `len_a` and `len_b` have been assigned the lengths of the lists `a` and `b`, respectively. All other variables retain their initial values.
