To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `len_a` is the length of the list `a`.
- `len_b` is the length of the list `b`.
- `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `d` is calculated as `k // 2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement checks if both `count_a` (the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`) and `count_b` (the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`) are greater than or equal to `d` (which is `k // 2`). If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Output:
The output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions described above. Since the exact values of `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d` are not provided explicitly, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **'YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO' (where count_a is the number of elements in list a that are less than or equal to k, count_b is the number of elements in list b that are less than or equal to k, and d is k // 2)**
