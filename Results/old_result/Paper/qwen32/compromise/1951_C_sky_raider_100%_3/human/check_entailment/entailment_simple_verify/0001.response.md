### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program's logic and correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Objective:** Minimize the total cost to buy exactly `k` tickets.
2. **Constraints:**
   - Can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
   - Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price for all subsequent days by `x`.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Sorting the Prices:**
   ```python
   l.sort()
   ```
   - **Correctness:** Sorting the prices in ascending order is a sound strategy because it ensures that we buy the cheapest tickets first, thereby minimizing the total cost.

2. **Iterating Over Days:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       s = min(m, k)
       c += s * (l[i] + t)
       t += s
       k -= s
   ```
   - **Buying Logic:**
     - `s = min(m, k)` ensures that we do not buy more tickets than allowed per day (`m`) or more than we need (`k`). This is correct.
     - `c += s * (l[i] + t)` calculates the cost of buying `s` tickets on day `i` considering the current price increase `t`. This is correct.
     - `t += s` updates the price increase for future days. This is correct.
     - `k -= s` decreases the number of tickets we still need to buy. This is correct.
   - **Termination:** The loop terminates when all tickets are bought (`k == 0`), which is correct.

3. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(int(c))
   ```
   - After processing all days, the program prints the total cost `c`, which is correct.

#### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- **State Annotations:**
  - Before the function call: The input values are correctly parsed and stored.
  - Inside the loop:
    - `s = min(m, k)`: Ensures the number of tickets bought per day is within limits.
    - `c += s * (l[i] + t)`: Correctly accumulates the cost.
    - `t += s`: Correctly updates the price increase.
    - `k -= s`: Correctly decrements the number of tickets needed.
  - After the loop: The final accumulated cost `c` is printed, which should be the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program using the provided example:

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `4 2 3`
- Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
- Sorted Prices: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- Execution:
  - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at price `2 + 0 = 2` → Cost: `2 * 2 = 4`, `t = 2`, `k = 1`
  - Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at price `4 + 2 = 6` → Cost: `1 * 6 = 6`, `t = 3`, `k = 0`
  - Total Cost: `4 + 6 = 10`

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `4 2 8`
- Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
- Sorted Prices: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- Execution:
  - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at price `2 + 0 = 2` → Cost: `2 * 2 = 4`, `t = 2`, `k = 6`
  - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at price `4 + 2 = 6` → Cost: `2 * 6 = 12`, `t = 4`, `k = 4`
  - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets at price `6 + 4 = 10` → Cost: `2 * 10 = 20`, `t = 6`, `k = 2`
  - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at price `8 + 6 = 14` → Cost: `2 * 14 = 28`, `t = 8`, `k = 0`
  - Total Cost: `4 + 12 + 20 + 28 = 64`

The program correctly computes the minimum cost for both test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to minimize the cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days with the given constraints.

**Final:** **True**
