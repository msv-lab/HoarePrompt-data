Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue is that it sorts the list of ticket prices before making any purchases, which does not account for the fact that purchasing tickets on a particular day increases the prices of tickets on subsequent days. The program should consider the prices in the order they are given and make decisions based on the current state of prices after each purchase.

Here's a brief explanation of why the current approach is incorrect:
- Sorting the prices loses the temporal information about when each price occurs.
- The program assumes that buying tickets on the cheapest days first is always optimal, but this is not true because buying tickets on a particular day affects the prices on all subsequent days.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that considers the current prices and the effect of each purchase on future prices.
