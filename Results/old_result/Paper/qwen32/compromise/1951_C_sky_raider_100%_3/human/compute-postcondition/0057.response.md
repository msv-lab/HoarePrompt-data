The value of `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Given that `i` is `n`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, and `t` is `0`, the new value of `c` is `c + min(m, k) * l[n]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus `S_total`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `0`, `c` is `c + min(m, k) * l[n]`, `s` is `min(m, k)`**
