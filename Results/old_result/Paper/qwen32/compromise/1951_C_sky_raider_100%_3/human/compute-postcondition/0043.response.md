Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - 2*s`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k - 2*s)`, `t` is `t + 2*s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s) + s * (l[2] + t)`**

Explanation: The value of `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its previous value. Since `i` is 2, the new term added to `c` is `s * (l[2] + t)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
