The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - s`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `c` is `c + s * (l[0] + t)`, `t` is `t + s`**
