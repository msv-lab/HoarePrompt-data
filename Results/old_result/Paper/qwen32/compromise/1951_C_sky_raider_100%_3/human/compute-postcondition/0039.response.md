The given code snippet only modifies the variable `t`. It increments `t` by the value of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `m` remains unchanged
- `k` is `k - s`
- `l` remains unchanged
- `s` is `min(m, k - s)`
- `t` is `t + s`
- `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s)`

The code `t += s` modifies `t` to be `t + s`. Since `t` was already `t + s` from the initial state, after executing `t += s`, `t` becomes `(t + s) + s`, which simplifies to `t + 2*s`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `m` remains unchanged
- `k` is `k - s`
- `l` remains unchanged
- `s` is `min(m, k - s)`
- `t` is `t + 2*s`
- `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s)`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - s`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k - s)`, `t` is `t + 2*s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t + s)`**
