In the provided `try` block, exceptions could occur at the points where list elements are being converted to integers and then decreased by 1 (`a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` and `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`). If the elements at indices `g` and `d` are not valid integers, a `ValueError` would be raised. Additionally, if `g` or `d` are out of bounds of the list `a`, an `IndexError` would be raised.

The `try` block aims to decrement the elements at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a`. If the element at index `g` becomes 0, it increments `g` by 1. Similarly, if the element at index `d` becomes 0, it decrements `d` by 1. If any exception occurs during this process, the `except` block catches it and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given the initial state and the operations performed, the output state after the `try` block would be as follows:
- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers where the first element has been decreased by 1, and the elements at indices `g` and `d` are further decreased by 1.
- If `a[g]` was originally 0, `g` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `g` remains unchanged.
- If `a[d]` was originally 0, `d` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `d` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1.
- `k` remains the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and is at least 2, not equal to any of the specified forbidden values.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

However, if any exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state after the `try` block is unknown.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element and the elements at indices `g` and `d` have been decreased by 1, `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` was 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and remains unchanged, `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values, `i` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the loop or if statement is broken.**
