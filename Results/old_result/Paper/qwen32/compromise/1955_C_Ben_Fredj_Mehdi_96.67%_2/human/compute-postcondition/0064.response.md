To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(a))` statement, let's break down the given information step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
   - `a` is a list of integers derived from an input string.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated substring in the input string.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated substring in the input string.
   - There are several constraints on the values of `n` and `k`, but they are not directly relevant to determining the length of `a`.

2. **Understanding `len(a)`**:
   - The `len(a)` function in Python returns the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` is constructed from the input string, and its length is determined by the number of integers in that string.

3. **Constraints on `k`**:
   - The constraints on `k` are provided to ensure certain conditions are met, but they do not affect the length of the list `a` directly. They are more about the relationship between `k` and the elements of `a`.

4. **Determining the Length of `a`**:
   - The length of `a` is determined by the number of integers in the input string, which is split by spaces.
   - Since the problem does not provide the exact input string, we cannot determine the exact number of elements in `a`. However, we know `a` is constructed from the input string, and its length is the number of integers in that string.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the most precise description we can give is that `len(a)` will print the number of integers in the input string that is used to construct the list `a`.

Thus, the output of the `print(len(a))` statement will be the number of elements in the list `a`.

Output: **len(a) (where len(a) is the number of elements in the list `a`)**
