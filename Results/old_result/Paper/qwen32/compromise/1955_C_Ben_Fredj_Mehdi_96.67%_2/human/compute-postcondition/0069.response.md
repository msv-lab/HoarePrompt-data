The code snippet `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` modifies the first element of the list `a` by subtracting 1 from its integer value. Given that `g` is 0, `a[g]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space
- `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values
- `d` is the length of `a` minus 1
- `g` is 0

After the execution of `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1`, the first element of the list `a` is decreased by 1. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element has been decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values; `d` is the length of `a` minus 1; `g` is 0**.

In simpler terms, the first element of `a` has been decremented by 1, and `n` reflects this change by also being decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
