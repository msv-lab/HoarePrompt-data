Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`a`**: A list of integers.
3. **`n`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. **`k`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. **`z`**: Incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('0')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `z`. It simply prints the string `'0'`.

### Output:
Since the print statement explicitly prints `'0'`, the output will be:

Output: **0**
