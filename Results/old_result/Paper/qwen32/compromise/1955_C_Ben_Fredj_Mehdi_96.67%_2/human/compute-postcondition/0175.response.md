Postcondition: **If no exception occurs, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers with `a[g]` decremented by 1, `a[d]` decremented by 2, and `d` decremented by 1 if `a[d]` was 0 after the first decrement, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, `k` is an integer value of at least 2, `z` is incremented by 1, and `i` is 2. Additionally, if `a[g]` is 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` is 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the loop or if statement is broken.**
