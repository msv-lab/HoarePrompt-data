The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the expression `k // 2`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the value of `k`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `k // 2` must be greater than 0. This means `k` must be at least 2 (since `k // 2` for `k = 1` would be 0, and the loop would not execute).

Given the constraints on `k` provided in the problem, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 2 and does not violate any of the given conditions.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values; `d` is the length of `a` minus 1; `g` is 0**.
