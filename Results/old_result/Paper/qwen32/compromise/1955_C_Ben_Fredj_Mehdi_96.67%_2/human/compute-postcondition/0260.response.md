Postcondition: **`k` is an odd integer. `t` remains the same integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. `a` is a list of integers where the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements (counting from the end) have been decremented by 1, with any elements that were 0 remaining 0. `z` is incremented by 1. `n` remains unchanged. `d` is adjusted based on the values of the elements at the end of the list `a` after decrementing. `g` is adjusted based on the values of the elements at the start of the list `a` after decrementing. `i` is equal to `k // 2`.**
