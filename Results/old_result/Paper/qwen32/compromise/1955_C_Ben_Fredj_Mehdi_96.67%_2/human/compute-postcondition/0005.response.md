The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each resulting substring to an integer, and then assigns this list of integers to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and `n` and `k` are derived from the first and second space-separated values of `a`, respectively. 

After executing the provided code, `a` is no longer a string but a list of integers. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.**
