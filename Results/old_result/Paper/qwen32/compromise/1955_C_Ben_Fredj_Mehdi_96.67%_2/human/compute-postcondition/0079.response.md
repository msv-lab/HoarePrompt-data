The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(k // 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k // 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Thus, to proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `k` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element has been decreased by 1, If `a[g]` was 0, then `g` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `g` remains 0, If `a[d]` was 0, then `d` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and remains unchanged, `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values, `i` is incremented by 1**
