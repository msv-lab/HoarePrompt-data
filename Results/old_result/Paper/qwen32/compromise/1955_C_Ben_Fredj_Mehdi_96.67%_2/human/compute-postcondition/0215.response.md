Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces.
3. `z` is incremented by 1.
4. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
5. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('99999')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'99999'`. The values of `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and simply prints the string `'99999'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **99999**
