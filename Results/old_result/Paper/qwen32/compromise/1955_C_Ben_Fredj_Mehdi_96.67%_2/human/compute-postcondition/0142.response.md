In the given task, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('5')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'5'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, and `z`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly provided in the `print` statement itself.

So, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'5'`.

Output: **5**
