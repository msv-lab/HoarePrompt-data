Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers.
3. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. `z` is incremented by 1.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print('10000')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and prints the string `'10000'`.
- The variables `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, and `z` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the value of these variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'10000'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, and `z`.

### Final Output:
Output: **10000**
