The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('1')
```

This statement is independent of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'1'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
