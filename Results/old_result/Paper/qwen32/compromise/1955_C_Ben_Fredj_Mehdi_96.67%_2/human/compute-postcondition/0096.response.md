Let's analyze the provided code and the given states to summarize the output state after the complete execution of the `try` statement.

### Code Analysis:
```python
try:
    a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
    a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
    if a[g] == 0:
        g += 1
    if a[d] == 0:
        d -= 1
except:
    break
```

### Potential Points of Exception:
1. **`a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1`**: This line could raise an exception if `a[g]` is not a valid integer.
2. **`a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`**: Similarly, this line could raise an exception if `a[d]` is not a valid integer.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer with constraints 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers where the first element, the element at index `g`, and the element at index `d` have already been decreased by 1.
- `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was 0.
- `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` was 0.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and remains unchanged.
- `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any specified forbidden values.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Output State After `try` Block:
- `a[g]` is decreased by 1.
- `a[d]` is decreased by 1.
- If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1.

### Output State After `except` Block:
- The state is unknown, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Summary:
The `try` block attempts to decrease the elements at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If either `a[g]` or `a[d]` is not a valid integer, an exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the values are decremented, and `g` and `d` are adjusted if the respective elements become 0.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains an integer with constraints 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers where the elements at indices `g` and `d` have been further decreased by 1.
- If `a[g]` becomes 0 after the second decrement, `g` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[d]` becomes 0 after the second decrement, `d` is decremented by 1.
- `n` remains the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1.
- `k` remains the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
- `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any specified forbidden values.
- `i` remains incremented by 1.
- If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Output State: **`t` is an integer with constraints 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. `a` is a list of integers where the elements at indices `g` and `d` have been further decreased by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0 after the second decrement, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after the second decrement, `d` is decremented by 1. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and remains unchanged. `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any specified forbidden values. `i` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
