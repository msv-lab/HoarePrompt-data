Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `z` is incremented by 1. If `n == 2` and `k == a[0] - 1` and `k == a[1] - 2`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, if `k` is not equal to 3000000000, then if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, no additional changes occur. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` (which points right after the last non-zero element from the start) is decremented by an additional 1. `i` is set to `k // 2`.**
