Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`a`**: A list of integers derived from an input string.
3. **`n`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. **`k`**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. **`k`** is explicitly given as `3000000000`.
6. **`k`** is not equal to several specific values (1999999998, 1999999999, 9999999999, 99999999999, 100000000000, 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 200000000000, 2147483648, 5999999999, 4294967295).
7. **`k`** does not match specific conditions involving `n` and the elements of `a`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('2')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'2'`. The value `'2'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, or `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
