Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `k` is not equal to 1999999998, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, and `k` is not equal to 99999999999; it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1); `k` is not equal to 9999999999; it is not the case that (n == 101 and k == 100000000000); `k` is not equal to 10000000000000; `k` is not equal to 99999999999999; `k` is not equal to 199999999999999; `k` is not equal to 1000000000000; `k` is not equal to 200000000000; it is not the case that (k == 2147483648 and n == 2); it is not the case that (n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]); it is not the case that (n == 5 and k == 2147483648); it is not the case that (n == 20 and k == 10000000000); `k` is not equal to 5999999999; `k` is not equal to 4294967295; and it is not the case that (n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and (k == a[1] - 2)); and `k` is not equal to 3000000000; and `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`; `d` is the length of `a` minus 1; `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. `a` is a list of integers where the first element has been decreased by 1. If `a[g]` was 0, then `g` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `g` remains 0. If `a[d]` was 0, then `d` is decremented by 1. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and remains unchanged. `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values. If an exception occurs, the loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element and the elements at indices `g` and `d` have been decreased by 1, `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` was 0, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and remains unchanged, `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values, `i` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown and the loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer with constraints 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. `a` is a list of integers where the elements at indices `g` and `d` have been further decreased by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0 after the second decrement, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after the second decrement, `d` is decremented by 1. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and remains unchanged. `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any specified forbidden values. `i` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
