Let's analyze the provided initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

The initial state provides several pieces of information about variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but the key point to focus on for the `print` statement is the value that needs to be printed. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('9')
```

This statement explicitly prints the string `'9'`. The value `'9'` is a literal string and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not require any additional computation or description of the variables.

Output: **9**
