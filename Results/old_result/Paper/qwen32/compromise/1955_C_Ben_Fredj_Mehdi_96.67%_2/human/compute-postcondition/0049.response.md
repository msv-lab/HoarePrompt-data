The given initial state provides a detailed description of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, and their respective values and constraints. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('10')
```

This statement will print the string `'10'` as it is.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **10**
