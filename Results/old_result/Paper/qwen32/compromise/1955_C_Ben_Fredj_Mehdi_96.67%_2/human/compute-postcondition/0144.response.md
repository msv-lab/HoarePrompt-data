Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Description:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is derived from the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is derived from the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
- `z` is incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the provided print statement).

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('0')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'0'`.

### Explanation:
- The value `'0'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
- None of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `z` are used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'0'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
