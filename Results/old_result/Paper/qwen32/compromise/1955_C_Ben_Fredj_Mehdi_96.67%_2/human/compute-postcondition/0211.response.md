The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, `k`) but the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('1')`. This means that the value to be printed is explicitly given as the string `'1'` and does not depend on the values of the other variables.

Let's break down the variables mentioned in the initial state for clarity:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces.
- `z` is incremented by 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

Since the `print` statement is `print('1')`, the output will be the string `'1'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, or `k`.

Output: **1**
