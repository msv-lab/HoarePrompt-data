Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string. If `k` == 200000000000, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. Otherwise, if `k` == 2147483648 and `n` == 2, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `n` == 2 and `k` == 1000000000 and `a` == [1000000000, 1000000000], no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `n` == 5 and `k` == 2147483648, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `n` == 20 and `k` == 10000000000, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `k` == 5999999999, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `k` == 4294967295, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `n` == 2, `k` == `a[0] - 1`, and `k` == `a[1] - 2`, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `k` == 3000000000, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `k` >= sum(`a`), no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `k` < sum(`a`), the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` in `a` is also decremented by 1 (unless it was already 0). `d` is adjusted based on the values of the elements at the end of list `a` after decrementing, and `g` is adjusted based on the values of the elements at the start of list `a` after decrementing. `i` is equal to `k // 2`.**
