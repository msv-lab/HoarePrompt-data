The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` takes a substring from the string `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3` (not inclusive). Given that `i` is 0, `s` will be the first three characters of the string `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with length greater than 2; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `s` is the substring of `a` from index 0 to 2**.
