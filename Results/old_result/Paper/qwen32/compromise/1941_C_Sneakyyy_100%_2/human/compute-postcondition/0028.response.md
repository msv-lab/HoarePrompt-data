The code provided only updates the value of `n` by reading an integer input. The other variables, such as `t`, `a`, `ans`, and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string; `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `a`; `i` is the smallest integer such that `i >= len(a) - 2`**.

In natural language: The value of `n` is updated to an input integer, while the values of `t`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
