Output State: **`num_iterations` is the number of iterations input by the user, and it must be greater than the current iteration count; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sequence with a length greater than 2; `ans` is 0; `i` is 3; `s` is the first three elements of the sequence `a`, and `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3, so `i` changes from 0 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
