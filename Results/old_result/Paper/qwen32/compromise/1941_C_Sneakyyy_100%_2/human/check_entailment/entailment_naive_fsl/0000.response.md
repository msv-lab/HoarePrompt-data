Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in non-overlapping chunks of three characters at a time. This means it does not handle cases where the substrings overlap or where removing a character could prevent the formation of these substrings in subsequent parts of the string.

For example, consider the input string "pimapie". The code will not correctly handle this string:

- The code checks the first three characters "pim" (not "map" or "pie").
- It then checks the next three characters "ima" (not "map" or "pie").
- It then checks the next three characters "map" (this is "map", so it increments the answer and moves the index by 3).
- It then checks the next three characters "ie" (out of bounds, so it stops).

However, the optimal solution would be to remove just one character ('m') to make the string "piie" which does not contain "map" or "pie". The current code would output 1, but the correct answer should be 1, but due to the logic flaw, it may not handle all cases optimally.

Another example is the string "mapiepie". The code will remove "map" and "pie" separately, resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing just two characters ('m' and 'p') can make the string "aiepie" which does not contain "map" or "pie". The correct answer should be 2, but the code may not handle this optimally either.

Thus, the code does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions in all cases, making it incorrect.
