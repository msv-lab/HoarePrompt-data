Reasoning: 
The program aims to find the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful, which means it should not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The provided program iterates through the string and counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of these substrings. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The program simply skips 3 characters each time it finds "pie" or "map", which may not be the optimal way to achieve the goal. For example, in the string "mappppie", the optimal solution would be to remove only 2 characters ('m' and 'p' from "map" or 'p' and 'p' from "ppp"), but the program would remove 3 characters ('map') and then another 3 characters ('ppp'), resulting in an incorrect answer of 6 instead of 2.

Thus, the program does not always provide the correct minimum number of deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
