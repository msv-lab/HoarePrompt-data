Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the approach used to count the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The current implementation only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in non-overlapping segments of three characters, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the string "mapie". The program would only count one deletion (removing "map" or "pie"), but in reality, removing just one character (the 'a' in "map") would make the string beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is required, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy strategy that accounts for overlapping substrings.
