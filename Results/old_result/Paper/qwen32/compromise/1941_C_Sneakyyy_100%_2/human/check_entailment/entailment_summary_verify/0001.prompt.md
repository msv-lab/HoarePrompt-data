You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it counts and prints the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in a given string of lowercase Latin letters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. It then iterates over each test case, reading the length of the string `n` and the string `a` itself.

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It also initializes `i` to 0, which will be used as an index to traverse the string.

3. **String Traversal**: The program uses a `while` loop to traverse the string `a` from index `i` to `len(a) - 2`. This ensures that the program can safely check substrings of length 3 without going out of bounds.

4. **Substring Check**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the substring `a[i:i+3]` is either "map" or "pie". If it is, the program increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1, indicating that a substring of length 3 has been found and one deletion is counted.

5. **Increment Index**: If the substring is not "map" or "pie", the program simply increments `i` by 1 to check the next character.

6. **Output**: After the loop completes for a test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Overlapping Substrings**: The program only checks for non-overlapping substrings of length 3. For example, in the string "ppiepieeee", the program will only count the first "pie" and not the second one because it increments `i` by 3 after finding a match. This means that the program may not correctly count all necessary deletions if the substrings "map" or "pie" overlap or are adjacent.
- **Inefficient Deletion Counting**: The program assumes that removing one character from each found substring of "map" or "pie" will suffice, which is not necessarily true. For example, in the string "mappppie", the program will count 2 deletions, but it could be made beautiful by removing only 2 characters (e.g., "mappie" -> "mie" or "mapppie" -> "map"), not necessarily by removing one character per found substring.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful in all cases. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
