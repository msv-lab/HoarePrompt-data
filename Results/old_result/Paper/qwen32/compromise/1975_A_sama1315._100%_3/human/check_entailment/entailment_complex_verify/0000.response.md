Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, the initial assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix, and then these two parts are swapped.

### Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a)`: This function takes an array `a` and checks if the array can be sorted by any number of rotations.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Function `func_1(a)`
The function `func_1(a)` works as follows:
1. It calculates the length of the array `n`.
2. It creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
3. It concatenates the array with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
4. It checks every possible subarray of length `n` within `concatenated_a` to see if it matches `sorted_a`.
5. If any such subarray matches, it returns `'Yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'No'`.

### Function `func_2()`
The function `func_2()` reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Annotations
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points:
- For `func_1(a)`, it states that the function checks if any contiguous subsequence of `a` concatenated with itself contains the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence exists, it returns `'Yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'No'`.
- For `func_2()`, it describes how the function reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program correctly determines whether the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation. However, let's verify this claim:

1. **Concatenation and Subarray Check**:
   - The logic of checking every possible subarray of length `n` within `concatenated_a` to see if it matches `sorted_a` is correct. If such a subarray exists, it indicates that the array can be rotated to become sorted.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2()` correctly reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and prints the results.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles arrays of length 2 to 50.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that are already sorted.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that can be sorted by a single rotation.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that cannot be sorted by any number of rotations.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
5
7 9 2 2 3
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
No
Yes
Yes
```

**Program Output:**
- For the first test case, the program should return `'No'` because the array cannot be sorted by any number of rotations.
- For the second test case, the program should return `'Yes'` because the array can be sorted by a series of rotations.
- For the third test case, the program should return `'Yes'` because the array is already sorted.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by performing the specified operation. The annotations and the provided code align with the problem description, and the program handles the test cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
