You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it computes a result using the function `func_1` on a list of integers. It then prints the results of these computations, one per line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem asks whether the array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and the two parts are swapped. Essentially, this operation is equivalent to rotating the array in such a way that a suffix of the array can be moved to the front.

The given program uses a clever approach to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
    - It takes an array `a` and calculates its length `n`.
    - It creates a sorted version of the array, `sorted_a`.
    - It then concatenates the array with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This is done to simulate all possible rotations of the array.
    - The program then checks every possible "window" of length `n` in `concatenated_a` to see if it matches `sorted_a`. If any such window matches, it means that the array can be rotated to form a sorted array, and the function returns 'Yes'. If no such window is found, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - This function reads the input from standard input.
    - It parses the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
    - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations and stores the result.
    - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

### Verification:

Let's verify the given program against the example provided:

- **First Test Case**:
    - Input: `1 1 4 5 1 4`
    - Sorted version: `1 1 4 4 5`
    - Concatenated version: `1 1 4 5 1 4 1 1 4 5 1 4`
    - Checking all windows of length 6 in the concatenated version does not yield a match with the sorted version.
    - Output: `No`

- **Second Test Case**:
    - Input: `7 9 2 2 3`
    - Sorted version: `2 2 3 7 9`
    - Concatenated version: `7 9 2 2 3 7 9 2 2 3`
    - Checking all windows of length 5 in the concatenated version yields a match with the sorted version (`2 2 3 7 9`).
    - Output: `Yes`

- **Third Test Case**:
    - Input: `1 2 3`
    - Sorted version: `1 2 3`
    - Concatenated version: `1 2 3 1 2 3`
    - Checking all windows of length 3 in the concatenated version yields a match with the sorted version (`1 2 3`).
    - Output: `Yes`

The program correctly handles these test cases, and the logic appears to be sound. It efficiently checks all possible rotations of the array by leveraging the concatenated version of the array.

Correctness: **True**
