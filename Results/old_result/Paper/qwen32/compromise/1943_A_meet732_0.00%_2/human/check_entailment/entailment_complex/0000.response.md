Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the final MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy:
1. **Count the Occurrences**: Count how many times each number from `0` to `n-1` appears in the array `a`.
2. **Initial Check**: If `0` does not appear in `a`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
3. **Determine MEX**:
   - If `0` appears, Alice can ensure that it is added to `c` because she starts first.
   - After `0` is taken care of, Alice and Bob will alternate turns. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by ensuring that the smallest possible integers are added to `c`.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX by removing integers that Alice could use to maximize the MEX.
   - The key observation is that if a number appears less than twice, it will be the MEX because Alice can ensure that it gets added to `c` before Bob can remove the only occurrence of a smaller number.
4. **Implementation**: The program counts the occurrences of each number and then finds the smallest number that appears less than twice. This number will be the MEX.

### Program Analysis:
- **Counting Occurrences**: The program uses a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each number from `0` to `n-1`.
- **Checking for `0`**: If `0` does not appear in `a`, the program correctly prints `0`.
- **Finding MEX**: The program iterates through the numbers starting from `1` and finds the smallest number that appears less than twice. This number is the MEX because it is the smallest number that cannot be fully removed by Bob.

### Verification with Test Cases:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `4, [0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Counts: `cntl = [2, 2, 0, 0]`
   - MEX: `2` (since `0` and `1` appear twice, and `2` is the smallest number that appears less than twice)
2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `4, [0, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Counts: `cntl = [1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - MEX: `1` (since `0` appears once, and `1` is the smallest number that appears less than twice)
3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `2, [1, 1]`
   - Counts: `cntl = [0, 2]`
   - MEX: `0` (since `0` does not appear in `a`)

The program correctly handles these cases and the logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally. Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
