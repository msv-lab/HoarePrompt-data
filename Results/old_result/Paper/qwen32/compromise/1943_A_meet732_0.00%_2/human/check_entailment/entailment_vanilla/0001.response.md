Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Objective**: Determine the final score (MEX) of array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (only Alice does this) or removing elements from `a` (both do this).
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

### Program Analysis

The program uses the following approach:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: It counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using `cntl`.
3. **Game Strategy**:
   - If `0` does not appear in `a`, the MEX is `0` (because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the initial `c` based on the count of `0`s in `a` (capped at `2`).
   - It then iterates through the possible values from `1` to `n`, decrementing `c` whenever a number appears less than twice.
   - When `c` reaches `0` or the loop ends, it prints the current number `j` as the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis

Let's verify the logic:

1. **Handling `0`**:
   - If `0` is not in `a`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer not present.
   - This part is correctly handled by the program.

2. **Handling Other Numbers**:
   - The program aims to ensure that as many numbers as possible (up to `2` occurrences) are included in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - It iterates through the numbers from `1` to `n` and checks their counts.
   - If a number appears less than twice, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` reaches `0` or the loop ends.

### Potential Issues

- The logic seems correct, but let's consider edge cases:
  - **Single Element**: If `a` contains only one element, the MEX should be `1` if the element is `0`, and `0` otherwise.
  - **All Elements Same**: If all elements are the same, the MEX should be the next integer after the repeated number.
  - **All Elements Distinct**: If all elements are distinct, the MEX should be `n` (the next integer after the largest element).

### Conclusion

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It handles various edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
