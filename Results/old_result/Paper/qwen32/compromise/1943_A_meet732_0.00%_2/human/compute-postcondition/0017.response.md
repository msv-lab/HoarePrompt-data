The value of `c` is decremented by 1. Given that `c` is initially the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]`, after decrementing, `c` will be `c - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is `min(2, cntl[0]) - 1`. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**
