The code snippet initializes a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
