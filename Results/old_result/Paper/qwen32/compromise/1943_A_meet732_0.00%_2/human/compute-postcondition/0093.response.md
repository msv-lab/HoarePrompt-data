To determine what will be printed when the `print(j)` statement is executed, we need to analyze the given initial state and constraints.

Here's the breakdown of the information provided:
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `c` is 1 (though `c` is not used in the print statement, it is mentioned in the precondition).
- The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
- Either `c` is false or `j` equals `n`.

Since `c` is explicitly stated to be 1, the condition "either `c` is false or `j` equals `n`" simplifies to "j equals `n`" because `c` being 1 means it cannot be false.

Thus, the value of `j` must be `n`.

Given this, the `print(j)` statement will output the value of `n`.

However, the exact value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe it based on the information given.

Output: **n (where n is the length of the cntl list minus 1)**
