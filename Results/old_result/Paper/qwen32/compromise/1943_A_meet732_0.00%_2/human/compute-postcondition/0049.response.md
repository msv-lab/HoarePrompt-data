The `print(0)` statement in the given code snippet will print the integer `0` to the console. The value `0` is explicitly provided in the `print` function and does not depend on any variable or object defined in the initial state. 

Here is the breakdown:
- The initial state describes `cntl` as a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in another list `a`. However, this information is not relevant to the `print(0)` statement.
- The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and will output the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
