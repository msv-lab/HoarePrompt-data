To determine the value printed by the `print(j)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and conditions step by step:

1. **Given Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `c` is calculated as `min(2, cntl[0]) - 1`.
   - The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
   - The condition `not c or j == n` is true.

2. **Deductions:**
   - Since `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, it means at least one element in the list `a` is 0.
   - `c` is calculated as `min(2, cntl[0]) - 1`. If `cntl[0]` is 1, then `c` is `min(2, 1) - 1 = 0`. If `cntl[0]` is greater than 1, then `c` is `min(2, cntl[0]) - 1 = 1`.
   - The condition `not c or j == n` being true means either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`. Since `c` can be 0 or 1, this condition simplifies to `j == n` when `c` is 1, and it is always true when `c` is 0.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the condition `not c or j == n` is true and `cntl[j] < 2`, the only way to ensure this condition is always true across all possible values of `c` is if `j` is equal to `n`. This is because if `c` is 1, then `j` must be `n` to satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the value of `j` that will be printed is `n`.

Output: **n**
