The code snippet reassigns `cntl` to a new list where each element is 0, and the length of this list is `n + 1`. This means that all previous values in `cntl` are discarded, and `cntl` now contains `n + 1` zeros.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `n` is an input integer.**
