Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is the difference between `x[i]` and `x[j]`; `dy` is the difference between `y[i]` and `y[j]`; `coef0[j]` is assigned the value `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`; `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`; `dfs(j)` has been called and executed.**

Explanation: The function `dfs(j)` has been called with `j` as the argument. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `j`, `dx`, `dy`, `coef0[j]`, and `coef1[j]` have been set as per the given initial state. No further changes to these variables are specified in the provided code snippet, except for the execution of the `dfs(j)` function.
