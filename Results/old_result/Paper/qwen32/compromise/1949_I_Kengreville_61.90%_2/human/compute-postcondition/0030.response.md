The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nodes`. If `j` is the next element in `nodes`, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `nodes`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the next element in `nodes`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next element in `nodes`.

Since `nodes` is a list that contains at least two elements, and we have just finished processing one element, `j` should now be the second element (if it was the first element before), or the third element (if it was the second element before), and so on.

Let's assume `j` was the first element in the previous iteration. Then, for the next iteration, `j` should be the second element in `nodes`.

State: **`nodes` is a list that contains at least two elements, `c0` is updated to `c0 + coef0[j] + coef0[j]`, `c1` is updated to `c1 + 2 * coef1[j]`, `j` is the second element in `nodes`**
