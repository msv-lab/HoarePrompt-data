The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `coef0[i]`. The value of `i` is `1`, so `coef0[1]` is set to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which is `0`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `c0` is `sum_coef0`, `c1` is `sum_coef1`, and `ok` is updated to `ok or c1 != 0`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `c0`, `c1`, or `ok`.**
