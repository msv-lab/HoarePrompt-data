Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[2]` and `coef0[3]` which are updated to some values if `visited[2]` was `False`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[2]` and `coef1[3]` which are updated to some values if `visited[2]` was `False`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `2` and `3` if `visited[2]` was `False`, otherwise `nodes` contains the integer `2`, `i` is 2, `c0` is `coef0[2] + coef0[3]` if `visited[2]` was `False`, otherwise `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `coef1[2] + coef1[3]` if `visited[2]` was `False`, otherwise `c1` is `1`, and `ok` is `True` if `visited[2]` was `False`, otherwise `ok` is `True`.**
