The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` updates the value of `c1` by adding `coef1[j]` to it. According to the initial state, `c1` was already updated to `c1 + coef1[j]`. After executing the code snippet, `c1` will be updated again by adding `coef1[j]` to its current value.

So, the new value of `c1` will be `c1 + coef1[j] + coef1[j]`, which simplifies to `c1 + 2 * coef1[j]`.

The other variables (`nodes`, `c0`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list that contains at least two elements, `c0` is updated to `c0 + coef0[j] + coef0[j]`, `c1` is updated to `c1 + 2 * coef1[j]`, `j` is the next element in `nodes`**.
