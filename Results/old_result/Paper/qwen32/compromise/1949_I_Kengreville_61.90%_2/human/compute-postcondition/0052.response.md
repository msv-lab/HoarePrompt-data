To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the list `nodes` and updates `c0` and `c1` based on the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`. The variables `c0` and `c1` are initialized to `0` and `1` respectively, and `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` are initialized to `0` and `1` respectively.

### Initial State and Iterations
- **Initial State**: `nodes = [1]`, `c0 = 0`, `c1 = 1`
- **After 1st iteration**: `nodes = [1, 2]`, `c0 = 0`, `c1 = 1`
- **After 2nd iteration**: `nodes = [1, 2]`, `c0 = 0`, `c1 = 1`
- **After 3rd iteration**: `nodes = [1, 2]`, `c0 = 0`, `c1 = 1`

Given the pattern, it appears that `nodes` is updated to include new indices, but the values of `c0` and `c1` remain unchanged after the first iteration. This suggests that `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes` are all `0` and `1` respectively, except for `j = 1` which has already been accounted for.

### Final Output State
Since `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are `None` for all `j` except `j = 1`, and `visited[1]` is `True`, the loop will only add indices to `nodes` that have not been visited. However, since `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are `None` for all `j` except `j = 1`, the values of `c0` and `c1` will not change after the first iteration.

Therefore, after all iterations, the `nodes` list will include all indices from `1` to `n` that have not been visited, but since `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are `None` for all `j` except `j = 1`, the values of `c0` and `c1` will remain `0` and `1` respectively.

### Conclusion
The final output state will be:
- `nodes` will be a list of all indices from `1` to `n` that have not been visited, but since `visited[1]` is `True` and `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are `None` for all `j` except `j = 1`, `nodes` will effectively remain `[1]` in terms of contributions to `c0` and `c1`.
- `c0` will remain `0`.
- `c1` will remain `1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which is `0`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[1]` which is `1`, `nodes` is a list containing the integer `1`, `i` is 1, `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `1`.**
