The code snippet provided assigns the value `0` to the variable `c0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which is `0`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[1]` which is `1`, `nodes` is a list containing the integer `1`, `i` is 1, `c0` is `0`.**
