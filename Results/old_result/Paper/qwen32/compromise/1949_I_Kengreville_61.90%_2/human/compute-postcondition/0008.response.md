The code snippet assigns the value `-coef1[i]` to `coef1[j]`. This means that the value of `coef1[j]` is now the negative of the value of `coef1[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks and must be greater than 0; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and the current value of `visited[i]` is True; `visited[j]` is False; `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component, and now `nodes` includes `i`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists used to store coefficients related to the constraints of the problem; `dx` is the value of `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is the value of `y[i] - y[j]`; the disks `i` and `j` are touching, as `(r[i] + r[j])`; `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`; `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`.**
