Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` where each element is `True` if it was visited during the loop, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is updated based on the `dfs` function if it was not visited before, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is updated based on the `dfs` function if it was not visited before, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `False` since there was no iteration where `c1` was not `0`.**
