You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Output

    NO
    
Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n

        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []

            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]

        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:

        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk index `i` to identify all disks that are part of the same connected component. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited, appends their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for these disks based on their radii and positions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Global Variables in DFS Function**:
   The `dfs` function uses global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` without explicitly declaring them as global. This can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results if these variables are not properly initialized or accessed.

2. **DFS Logic**:
   The DFS logic in the `dfs` function is intended to traverse the graph of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the requirement that the sum of all radii strictly decreases. The DFS function calculates `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` but does not ensure that the new radii will result in a strictly decreasing sum of radii.

3. **Condition for Tangency**:
   The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks for exact tangency. However, due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic and the problem constraints, it is more appropriate to check if the distance between centers is within a small tolerance of the sum of radii. The current implementation does not account for potential floating-point precision issues.

4. **Handling of Non-Connected Components**:
   The main function `func_1` checks for connected components using DFS but does not handle the logic to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases across all components. The variable `ok` is set to `True` if any component has a non-zero `c1`, but this does not guarantee that the sum of radii will strictly decrease.

5. **Output**:
   The output is based on the variable `ok`, which is set if any component has a non-zero `c1`. However, this condition does not ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases. The problem requires a more comprehensive approach to check if the radii can be adjusted to meet all the conditions.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
```
In this case, the disks are tangent to each other in a line. The current implementation might incorrectly determine that it is possible to adjust the radii to meet the conditions, but in fact, it is not possible to strictly decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Ensuring that the DFS correctly handles the tangency condition with proper precision checks.
- Ensuring that the logic for adjusting radii strictly decreases the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.
- Handling multiple connected components and ensuring the sum of radii decreases across all components.

Given these issues, the current implementation is incorrect.
