The function reads input values representing the number of disks and their respective coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to process each disk, updating coefficients and marking disks as visited. The function determines if there is at least one iteration where a specific condition (c1 != 0) is met and prints "YES" if true, otherwise prints "NO".
