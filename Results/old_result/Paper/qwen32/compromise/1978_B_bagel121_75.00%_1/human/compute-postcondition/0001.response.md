The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations specified. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, we don't need to adjust its state explicitly. However, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, this already ensures that the loop can execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
