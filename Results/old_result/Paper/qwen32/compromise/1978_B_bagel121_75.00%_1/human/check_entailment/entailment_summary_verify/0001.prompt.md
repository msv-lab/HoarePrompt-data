You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the printed value is `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the maximum possible sequence of `k` numbers ending at `b` and the remaining numbers multiplied by `a`, then prints this sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`. The goal is to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

### Key Observations

1. **Base Case**: If `a >= b`, it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price won't yield more profit.
2. **Choosing `k`**: When `a < b`, we should calculate the profit for different values of `k` and choose the one that maximizes the total profit. The maximum possible value of `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)` because the price cannot go below 1.

### Calculating Profit

For a given `k`:
- The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `k * (2*b - k + 1) / 2`.
- The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

### Program Analysis

Let's look at the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
```

- The program correctly handles the base case where `a >= b` by selling all buns at the usual price `a`.
- When `a < b`, it calculates the maximum possible `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
- It then calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the arithmetic series sum formula.
- Finally, it calculates the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns and sums up both parts to get the total profit.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.
