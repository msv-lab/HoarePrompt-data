To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `results` is an initially empty list that will store the results of each test case.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration:
     - `n` is the number of integers in the current test case.
     - `arr` is updated to be a list of `n` integers from the `data` list.
     - `func_1(arr)` is called with the current `arr`, and its result is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output State**:
   - After all iterations, `results` will contain the results of `func_1(arr)` for each test case.
   - `index` will be updated to point to the position in `data` right after the last integer of the last test case.
   - `arr` will hold the last test case's integers.
   - `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given this understanding, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`arr` is the list of integers from the last test case, `index` is the position right after the last integer of the last test case in `data`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each test case, `t` is unchanged, and `data` is unchanged.**
