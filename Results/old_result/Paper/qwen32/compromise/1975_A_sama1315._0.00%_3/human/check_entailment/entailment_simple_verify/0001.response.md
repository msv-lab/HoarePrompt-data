### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program. The program only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the problem allows for the array to be split into two parts and the parts swapped, which can potentially result in a sorted array even if the original array is not sorted.

Let's break down the annotations and the behavior of the program:

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted by using the `all` function with a generator expression to verify that each element is less than or equal to the next element.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns "Yes".
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second element using the `any` function.
   - If such a pair exists, it returns "No".
   - The fallback `else 'Yes'` statement is logically incorrect because if the array is not sorted, it should not return "Yes" without further checks.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and collects the results.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results in the required format.

### Flaw in the Program:
The primary issue is that `func_1` does not account for the possibility of rotating the array to achieve a sorted order. The problem requires checking if the array can be split and swapped to become sorted, not just if it is already sorted.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a point in the array where the order breaks and if the array can be rotated such that the resulting array is sorted. This involves:
1. Finding the point where the array stops being sorted.
2. Checking if the array can be split at that point and swapped to form a sorted array.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by rotating it. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
