Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation consists of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping these two parts.

### Key Points

1. **Operation Definition**: 
   - Split the array into two parts, `x` (prefix) and `y` (suffix), such that `a = x + y`.
   - Perform the operation `a := y + x`.

2. **Objective**: 
   - Determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the above operation any number of times.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Array length `n` is between 2 and 50.
   - Each element in the array is a positive integer up to \(10^6\).
   - There can be up to 1000 test cases.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - It checks if the array is already non-decreasing using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is non-decreasing, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If the array is not non-decreasing, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If there is such an element, it returns `'No'`. 
   - If the array is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing, it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads input from standard input.
   - It processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

### Correctness Analysis

The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. Here's why:

- The function checks if the array is non-decreasing and returns `'Yes'` if it is.
- If the array is not non-decreasing, it checks if there is any element greater than the next element and returns `'No'` if such an element exists.
- However, the function incorrectly returns `'Yes'` if the array is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing, which is not a valid condition for the problem.

The core issue is that the function does not correctly determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by the allowed operation. The operation allows for a limited type of reordering, but the function does not account for this properly.

### Conclusion

Given the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
