Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Issues Identified in the Program:

1. **Handling of Quaffle Movement and Catching**:
   - The program does not update the Quaffle's position when a player catches it.
   - The program does not move the Quaffle back to the center of the field when a player throws it.

2. **Goal Scoring**:
   - The program does not differentiate between scoring in the correct or incorrect goal. It simply checks if the player's position is in the goals list, without considering which team's goal it is.
   - If a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the program incorrectly scores a point for that player's team.

3. **Movement Function**:
   - The movement function `func_1` is correctly defined but not used properly in the context of catching the Quaffle. The program does not update the Quaffle's position when a player catches it.

4. **Final Score**:
   - The final score is printed with the team scores swapped. The correct format should be `FINAL SCORE: r b`, where `r` is the score of the red team and `b` is the score of the blue team.

### Function Summary Analysis:

The provided function summary for `func_1` is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to move a player or the Quaffle by a specified number of cells in a given direction. The summary provided states that the function concatenates the elements of the tuples, which is not the case. The correct behavior is to add the movement vector to the current position.

### Correctness Evaluation:

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Quaffle Movement and Catching**:
   - The program does not handle the Quaffle's movement correctly. When a player catches the Quaffle, the Quaffle's position should be updated to the player's position. When a player throws the Quaffle, the Quaffle should be moved to the center of the field.
   - The program does not handle the Quaffle's position correctly, leading to incorrect game states and scoring.

2. **Goal Scoring**:
   - The program does not differentiate between the correct and incorrect goal for the player. It simply checks if the player's position is in the goals list, without considering which team's goal it is.
   - If a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the program incorrectly scores a point for that player's team instead of the opposing team.

3. **Final Score**:
   - The final score is printed with the team scores swapped, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the identified issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
