### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points we can score in a card game where we and Nene take turns placing cards on a table. We score a point if the card we place has already been placed on the table by either of us. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize our score.

The key observation here is that we can only score points when we play a card that has already been played before. Therefore, the number of points we can score is equal to the number of duplicate cards we have in our hand because each duplicate card can potentially be played after the first occurrence of that card has already been placed on the table.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It counts the occurrences of each card in the input list using a frequency array (`cnt`). Then, for each unique card, it adds the number of duplicates (i.e., `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)`) to the answer. This effectively counts how many times we can play a duplicate card, which corresponds to the maximum number of points we can score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points we can score under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
