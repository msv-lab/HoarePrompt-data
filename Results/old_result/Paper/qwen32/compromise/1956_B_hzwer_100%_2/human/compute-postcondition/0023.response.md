The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string representations of integers, converts them to actual integers, and stores them in the list `a`. This operation changes the value of `a` from its initial state to the new list of integers read from the input.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `input` still holds a valid integer `t` where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains `t`.
- `a` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each `cnt[x]` represents the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`. This list is not modified by the current code snippet.
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`. This variable is also not modified by the current code snippet.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each `cnt[x]` represents the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.**
