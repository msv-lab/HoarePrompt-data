The code snippet `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` zeros. After executing the code, the value at `cnt[x]` will be 1 (if it was 0 before) or incremented by 1 if it already had a value.

Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `x` is a valid index within the bounds of `cnt` (i.e., `0 ≤ x ≤ t`). The other variables (`input`, `t`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1**.
