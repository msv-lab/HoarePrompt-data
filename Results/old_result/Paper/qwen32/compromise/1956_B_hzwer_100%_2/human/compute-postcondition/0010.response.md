The code snippet increments the count of the current element `x` in the list `cnt`. Given that `x` is the next element in the list `a`, the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where the value at index `x` is incremented by 1; `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
