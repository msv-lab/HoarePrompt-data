`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`; `n` is an input integer**.
