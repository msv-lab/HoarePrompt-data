Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided at the start, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
