You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of upcoming rounds).
   - It also reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Difficulty Levels:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' through 'G').
   - The dictionary is initialized with all keys set to 0.
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and increments the count for each difficulty level found.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of New Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of new problems needed.
   - It then iterates over the keys of the dictionary `d`.
   - For each difficulty level, if the count of that level (`d[val]`) is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. This is because each round requires at least one problem of each difficulty level, and if there aren't enough problems of a particular level, Vlad needs to create the difference.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed for that test case.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Calculation Logic:** The logic for calculating `ans` is incorrect. The condition `if d[val] <= m:` is flawed because it does not account for the fact that each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level. Instead, the program should check if the total number of problems of each type across all rounds is sufficient. Specifically, for each difficulty level, Vlad needs at least `m` problems, not just `m - d[val]` if `d[val] <= m`.
- **Default Value Function:** The function `default_value()` is defined but never used. This function is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Corrected Logic:
- For each difficulty level, Vlad needs `m` problems. If the current count `d[val]` is less than `m`, then `m - d[val]` additional problems are needed for that level.
- Summing up the additional problems needed for all levels gives the final answer.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of new problems needed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
