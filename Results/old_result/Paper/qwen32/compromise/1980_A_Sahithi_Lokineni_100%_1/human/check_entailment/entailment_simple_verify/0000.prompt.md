You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- He currently has `n` problems with varying difficulty levels.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he has enough problems for all `m` rounds.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It also reads a string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the existing problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - The dictionary is initialized with all keys set to 0.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the counts in the dictionary.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It then iterates over each key in the dictionary `d`.
   - For each difficulty level, if the count `d[val]` is less than `m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Counting Additional Problems:**
  - The current logic incorrectly adds `m - d[val]` for every difficulty level where `d[val]` is less than `m`. This means it assumes that each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level.
  - However, the problem statement requires `m` problems of each difficulty level, not just one per round.
  - Therefore, the correct logic should be to check if `d[val]` is less than `m` and then add `m - d[val]` to `ans` only once for each difficulty level.

### Corrected Logic:
- For each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m`, add `m - d[val]` to `ans`.

### Example Case:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
7 1
ABCDEFG
```
- Here, `n = 7` and `m = 1`.
- The string `s` contains one problem of each difficulty level.
- According to the current logic, the program will add `1 - 1` for each difficulty level, resulting in `ans = 0`.
- This is correct because Vlad already has one problem of each difficulty level, and he only needs one round.

However, let's consider another test case:
```
1
6 1
ABCDEF
```
- Here, `n = 6` and `m = 1`.
- The string `s` contains one problem of each difficulty level except 'G'.
- According to the current logic, the program will add `1 - 1` for each difficulty level present and `1 - 0` for 'G', resulting in `ans = 1`.
- This is correct because Vlad is missing one problem of difficulty level 'G'.

But let's consider this test case:
```
1
6 2
ABCDEF
```
- Here, `n = 6` and `m = 2`.
- The string `s` contains one problem of each difficulty level except 'G'.
- According to the current logic, the program will add `2 - 1` for each difficulty level present and `2 - 0` for 'G', resulting in `ans = 7`.
- This is incorrect because Vlad needs two problems of each difficulty level, and he is missing one problem of each difficulty level except 'G', so he needs `7` additional problems, which is correct in this case but the logic is flawed for other cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where `m > 1` correctly. It incorrectly assumes that each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level instead of requiring `m` problems of each difficulty level.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to correctly calculate the number of additional problems needed when `m > 1`. It should ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level, not just one per round.
