### Reasoning:
The given program is supposed to calculate the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 application icons and `y` number of 2x2 application icons. Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it with the problem's requirements.

1. **Function Call Issue**: The program starts with a call to `func_1()` before the function is defined. This will cause a `NameError` in Python. The function should be defined first before it is called.

2. **Logic for Calculation**:
   - **When both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - The program calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so two 2x2 icons can fit in one screen, and we need to round up to account for partial screens.
     - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and adding `y * 4`. This adjustment is incorrect. The subtraction should be `bxsfory * 4` (the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons) rather than `bxsfory * 15`.
     - After adjusting `x`, it calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15. This is correct if the adjusted `x` value is correctly calculated.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   
   - **When `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The program correctly calculates the ceiling of `y / 2` and prints it.
   
   - **When `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - The program correctly calculates the ceiling of `x / 15` and prints it.
   
   - **When both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The program correctly prints 0.

The main issue with the program is the incorrect adjustment of `x` when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The adjustment should be `x - bxsfory * 4` instead of `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This adjustment is necessary because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 15.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program, particularly the incorrect adjustment of `x` when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
