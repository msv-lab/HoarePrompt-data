Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called, otherwise, a `NameError` will occur.

2. The logic for calculating the number of screens is incorrect. The current implementation does not correctly account for the placement of 2x2 and 1x1 icons on the 5x3 grid.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - 4 * y
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15) if remaining_cells < x else 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

func_1()
```

The corrected program ensures that the function is defined before it is called and correctly calculates the number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons.
