Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `dif` is not 0, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, then `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `res` remains `n - 1`.**
