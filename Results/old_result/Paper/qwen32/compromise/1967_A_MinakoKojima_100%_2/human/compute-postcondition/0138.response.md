The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. Since the loop variable `_` does not influence the loop's continuation or the state within the loop, we do not need to adjust it.

However, the loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. This means that the loop will execute as long as there are more iterations to be performed based on the input value. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the state of `ans`, `res`, and `ans_list` does not need to be adjusted in terms of the loop variable.

State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value achieved by adding differences from `a` while `k` is sufficient plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` plus `res`, `res` is unchanged, `ans_list` now includes `ans`**. 

The state of `ans`, `res`, and `ans_list` will remain the same at the start of the next iteration in terms of the loop variable, as the loop variable `_` does not affect these states. The loop will continue to execute based on the number of times specified by the input.
