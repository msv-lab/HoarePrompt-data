Postcondition: **`ans` is the maximum possible value incrementally adjusted by differences in `a` within the constraints of `k` plus `k // n` if `k` is not `0`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum possible value incrementally adjusted by differences in `a` within the constraints of `k`. `k` is not `0` if it was adjusted by `k // n`, otherwise it remains `0`. `res` is the count of elements not adjusted due to `k` exhaustion or `dif` being `0` plus `k % n` if `k` is not `0`. Otherwise, `res` remains the count of elements not adjusted due to `k` exhaustion or `dif` being `0`.**
