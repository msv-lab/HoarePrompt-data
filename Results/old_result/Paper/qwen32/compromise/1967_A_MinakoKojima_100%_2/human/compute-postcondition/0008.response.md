The code snippet `dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]` calculates the difference between the `i+1`-th and `i`-th elements of the sorted list `a` and assigns this value to the variable `dif`. The previous values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced or updated is `dif`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the first element of `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`**.
