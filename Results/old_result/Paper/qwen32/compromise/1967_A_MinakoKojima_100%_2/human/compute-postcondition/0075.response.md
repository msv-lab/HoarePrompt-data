The code snippet `res = n - 1` directly assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `res`. This changes the value of `res` from its previous state to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `a[0]`, `k` is the value read from the input, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains `ans` as its last element, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is now `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
