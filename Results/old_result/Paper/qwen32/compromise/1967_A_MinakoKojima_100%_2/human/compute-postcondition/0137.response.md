The code snippet appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. The values of `ans`, `res`, and the precondition about `ans` remain unchanged, except for the addition of `ans` to `ans_list`.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value achieved by adding differences from `a` while `k` is sufficient plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` plus `res`, `res` is unchanged, `ans_list` now includes `ans`.**
