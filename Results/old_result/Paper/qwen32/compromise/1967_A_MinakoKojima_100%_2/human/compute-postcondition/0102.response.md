The code snippet `ans += dif` adds the value of `dif` to `ans`. The values of `i`, `dif`, and `res` are not directly affected by this operation unless `dif` is used in their calculations, which it is not in this snippet. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `res - 1`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged; `ans` is `ans + dif`.**
