The code snippet sorts the list `a`. The values of `ans`, `res`, `ans_list`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value achieved by adding differences from `a` while `k` is sufficient plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` plus `res`; `res` is unchanged; `ans_list` now includes `ans`; `n` and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
