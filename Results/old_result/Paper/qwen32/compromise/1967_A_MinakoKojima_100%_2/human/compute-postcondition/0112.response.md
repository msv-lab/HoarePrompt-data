Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `k` was originally 0, the loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `ans`, `k`, or `res`. If `k` was not 0, the behavior depends on the comparison between `k` and `dif * (i + 1)`: if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is incremented by `dif`, `k` is decremented by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decremented by 2 if `dif` is 0, otherwise by 1. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is incremented by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and `res` is adjusted by `k % (i + 1)` based on whether `dif` is 0 or not; if `i` is 0, `res` remains unchanged.**
