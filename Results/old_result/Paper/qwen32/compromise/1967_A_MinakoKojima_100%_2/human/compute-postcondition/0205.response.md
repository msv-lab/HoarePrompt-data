The code snippet appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. The values of `ans`, `res`, `n`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans_list` now includes the current value of `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the remaining count of unadjusted elements, `ans_list` includes the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and `k` is 0.**
