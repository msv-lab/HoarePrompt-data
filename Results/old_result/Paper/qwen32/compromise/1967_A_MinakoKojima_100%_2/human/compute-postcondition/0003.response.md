The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` (the number of test cases) must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
