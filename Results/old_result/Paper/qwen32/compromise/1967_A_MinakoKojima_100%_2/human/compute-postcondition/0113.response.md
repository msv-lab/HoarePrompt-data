Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1` and `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not 0, the behavior depends on the value of `k`: if `k` was originally 0, the loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `ans`, `k`, or `res`. If `k` was not 0, and `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is incremented by `dif`, `k` is decremented by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decremented by 1. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is incremented by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and `res` is decremented by `k % (i + 1)`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decremented by 1.**
