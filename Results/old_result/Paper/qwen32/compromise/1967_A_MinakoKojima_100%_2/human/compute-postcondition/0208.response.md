The initial state provided only specifies that `ans_list` must contain at least one element. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(a)`, which involves a variable `a` that is not mentioned in the initial state. 

Since `a` is not defined or mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its value based on the given information. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `a`.

Output: **a (where a is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state)**
