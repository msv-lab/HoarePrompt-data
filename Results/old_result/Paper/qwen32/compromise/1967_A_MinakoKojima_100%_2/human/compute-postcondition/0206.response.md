To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the provided code snippet. The code processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and an integer `k`. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the differences between the sorted elements of `a` and the available `k`. The final value of `ans` for each test case is then appended to `ans_list`.

The loop processes each test case independently, and the state of `ans_list` is the only variable that accumulates results across all test cases. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the final output state:

1. **Initialization**: `ans_list` is initialized as an empty list.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - For each test case, the input values `n` and `k` are read, followed by the list `a` of `n` integers.
    - The list `a` is sorted.
    - The initial value of `ans` is set to the smallest element in `a`, and `res` is set to `n - 1` (the number of elements minus one).
    - The code then iterates through the sorted list `a` and adjusts `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements and the available `k`.
    - If `k` is exhausted or if the end of the list is reached, the final value of `ans` is adjusted by `k // n` and `res` is adjusted by `k % n` if `k` is not zero.
    - The final value of `ans` is then calculated by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and `res`.
    - This final `ans` is appended to `ans_list`.
3. **Final Output State**:
    - After all test cases have been processed, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case.
    - The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, `res`, and the loop control variable are not retained after the loop completes.

Thus, the final output state is solely the contents of `ans_list`, which contains the final calculated `ans` values for each test case.

Output State: **ans_list contains the final calculated `ans` values for each test case.**
