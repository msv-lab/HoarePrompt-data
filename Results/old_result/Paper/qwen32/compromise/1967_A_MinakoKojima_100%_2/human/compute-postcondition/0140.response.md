The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and maps these integers into a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `res`, `ans_list`, `n`, or `k`. The only variable that changes is `a`, which now holds the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value achieved by adding differences from `a` while `k` is sufficient plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` plus `res`; `res` is unchanged; `ans_list` now includes `ans`; `n` and `k` are the integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
