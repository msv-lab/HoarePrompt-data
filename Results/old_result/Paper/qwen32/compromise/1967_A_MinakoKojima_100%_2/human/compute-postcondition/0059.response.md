Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 2`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. The loop or if statement is broken.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `dif`, `res`, `ans`, and `k` remain as they were before the `break` statement, except that the control flow is exited from the most internal loop or if statement.
