Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `dif` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `0 // (i + 1)`. `dif` is not 0, and `res` is `n - 2` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (i + 1)` if `i` is not 0, and `res` remains `n - 1` if `i` is 0. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
