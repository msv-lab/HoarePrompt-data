The value of `k` is decremented by `dif * (i + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer minus `dif * (i + 1)`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `dif`, `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)` minus `dif * (i + 1)`**.

Simplified Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer minus `dif * (i + 1)`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `dif`, `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 1`**.
