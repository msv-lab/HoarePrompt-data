Output State: **`s` is either `['1', '1', '1']`, `['0', '1', '1']`, `['1', '0', '1']`, or `['0', '0', '1']` depending on the least significant bit of `x` and the result of `x & pow(2, i)`. `length` is `30`, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `i` is `2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `s` has an additional element `'1'` appended to it, making its possible values `['1', '1', '1']`, `['0', '1', '1']`, `['1', '0', '1']`, or `['0', '0', '1']`. The variable `length` remains `30`, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 1, and `i` remains `2`.
