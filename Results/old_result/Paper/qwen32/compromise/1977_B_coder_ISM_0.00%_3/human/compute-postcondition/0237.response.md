Postcondition: **`length` is either 30 or 31, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters representing the transformed binary form of `x` with no consecutive '1's, and `flag` is either 0 or 1. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i - 1]` is now `'-1'`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
