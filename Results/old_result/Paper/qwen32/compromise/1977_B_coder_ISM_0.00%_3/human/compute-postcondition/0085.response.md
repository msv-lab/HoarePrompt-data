The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `x`. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`s`, `length`, `t`, `nalla`) as described in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction or update of the variable `x` with the input value.

Output State: **The string `s` will have all `'1'`s shifted to the left of all `'-1'`s, with no `'1'`s directly followed by `'-1'`s. The value of `length` remains unchanged unless `flag` was `True` and the 30th character of `s` was not `'1'`, in which case `length` is incremented by 1 and `'1'` is appended to `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. `x` is an input integer.**
