The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the element at index `i - 1` in the list `s` to be the string `'-1'`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `s[i]` is `'0'`. The value of `length` (30 or 31) and the value of `s[i]` remain unchanged. The only change is to the element at index `i - 1`.

Output State: **`length` is 30 or 31; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `s[i]` is `'0'`; `s[i - 1]` is `'-1'`.**
