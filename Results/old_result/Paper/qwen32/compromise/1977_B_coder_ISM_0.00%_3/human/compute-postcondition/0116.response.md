Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0'. `length` is 30. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30. `flag` is not 1. Additionally, if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` retains its original value (which means `s[i]` could be '1' if it was originally '0'). Otherwise, `s[i]` retains its original value. Furthermore, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
