The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i - 1` to the string `'-1'`. 

Given the initial state, `s` is a list of characters representing the transformed binary form of `x` with no consecutive '1's, and `s[i]` is now '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '1'. After the code executes, `s[i - 1]` will be `'-1'` instead of `'1'`.

The other variables `length`, `x`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`length` is either 30 or 31, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters representing the transformed binary form of `x` with no consecutive '1's except `s[i - 1]` is now `'-1'`, and `flag` is either 0 or 1.**
