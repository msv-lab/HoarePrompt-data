The code sets the `(i-1)`-th element of the sequence `s` to `'-1'`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `i` was originally pointing to the current element, and now it points to the next one. Therefore, the element that was previously set to `'0'` is now set to `'-1'`.

Output State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence with the `i-1`-th element set to `'-1'`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
