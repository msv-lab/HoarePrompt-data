The code snippet `s[29] = '0'` modifies the 30th element of the list `s` (since list indices start at 0) by setting it to '0'. No other variables are affected by this operation. The length of `s` remains 30, `x` retains its value as the input integer, `i` remains 28, and `flag` remains not 0.

Output State: **length is 30, x is the input integer, i is 28, and s is a list of 30 characters representing the transformed binary form of x with no consecutive '1's, where the 30th character is '0', and flag is not 0.**
