The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is either `['1']` or `['0']`. After appending `'1'`, `s` will be either `['1', '1']` or `['0', '1']`.

The other variables (`length`, `t`, `nalla`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is either `['1', '1']` or `['0', '1']`; `length` is `30`; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is `1`.**
