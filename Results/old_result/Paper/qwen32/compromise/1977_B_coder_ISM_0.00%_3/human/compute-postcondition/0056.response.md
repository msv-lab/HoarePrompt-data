Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements where the first element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is '1' and `s[3]` is '1', then `s[2]` is updated to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` was originally '0', then `s[2]` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `s[2]` remains unchanged; `length` is 30; `flag` remains unchanged unless updated as described; `i` is 2.**
