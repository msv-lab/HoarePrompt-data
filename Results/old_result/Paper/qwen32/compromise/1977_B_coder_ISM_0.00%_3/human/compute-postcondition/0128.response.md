Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, where each element is either '1' or '0'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[27]` was '0', then `s[27]` is now '1' and `flag` is 0; otherwise, `s[27]` retains its original value and `flag` retains its original value. `length` is 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30, and `i` is 27.**
