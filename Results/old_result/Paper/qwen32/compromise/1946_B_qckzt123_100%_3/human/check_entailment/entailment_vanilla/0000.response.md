Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   
2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the sum, we should focus on adding the largest possible positive sums repeatedly. If the array has any positive subarrays, the optimal strategy is to keep doubling the largest positive subarray sum and adding it to the total sum. If there are no positive subarrays, the best we can do is add zeros (by choosing empty subarrays).

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Calculate the total sum of the array.
   - Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is positive, repeatedly double it and add it to the total sum up to `k` times.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative, the best we can do is add zeros, so the result is simply the total sum of the array.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `k` (number of operations).
   - It then reads the array `a`.

2. **Calculating Total Sum**:
   - The program calculates the total sum `s` of the array.

3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The program uses a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray (`t`). This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum `tmp`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it resets to zero. The maximum value of `tmp` during this process is stored in `t`.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The initial result `ans` is set to `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - If `k > 1`, the program doubles `t` and adds it to `ans` for `k-1` times, taking care to apply the modulo operation at each step to prevent overflow.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases.

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Array: `[-4, -7]`
  - Total sum `s = -11`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 0` (since all elements are negative)
  - Result: `(-11 + 0) % MOD = 999999996`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Array: `[2, 2, 8]`
  - Total sum `s = 12`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 12`
  - After 3 operations: `ans = (12 + 12) % MOD + (12 * 2) % MOD + (12 * 4) % MOD = 96`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Array: `[7]`
  - Total sum `s = 7`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 7`
  - After 7 operations: `ans = (7 + 7) % MOD + (7 * 2) % MOD + ... = 896`

All test cases match the expected results, indicating that the program is likely correct.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and verification with example test cases, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
