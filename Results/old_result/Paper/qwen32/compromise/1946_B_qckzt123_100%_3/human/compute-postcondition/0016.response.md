Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer, and `a` must have at least one element, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`. If `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains `tmp` + `x`.**
