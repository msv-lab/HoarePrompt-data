Given the initial state and the operation `t *= 2`, we need to determine the new value of `t` and ensure that all other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

The initial state provides the following:
- `t` is `(((2 * t) % MOD) * 2) % MOD`
- `tmp` is the final cumulative sum (or 0 if negative)
- `ans` is `((((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t) % MOD` (and is within the range defined by `MOD`)
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `n` is the first integer read from input
- `k` must be greater than 5
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input line
- `s` is the sum of the list `a`
- `i` is 4

After executing `t *= 2`, the value of `t` is doubled. Since the initial value of `t` is already defined as `(((2 * t) % MOD) * 2) % MOD`, doubling it means multiplying it by 2 again. Thus, the new value of `t` becomes `((((2 * t) % MOD) * 2) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`.

Therefore, the updated value of `t` is `((((2 * t) % MOD) * 2) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`.

The other variables (`tmp`, `ans`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `((((2 * t) % MOD) * 2) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`; `tmp` is the final cumulative sum (or 0 if negative); `ans` is `((((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t) % MOD`; `T` is `T - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` must be greater than 5; `a` is a list of integers read from the input line; `s` is the sum of the list `a`; `i` is 4**.
