To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the variables `t` and `ans` evolve with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis
- **Initial State:**
  - `t`: The maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0.
  - `tmp`: Cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends.
  - `ans`: `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`

- **Loop Body:**
  - For each iteration `i` from `0` to `k-2` (inclusive):
    - `t *= 2`
    - `t %= MOD`
    - `ans += t`
    - `ans %= MOD`

### Iteration Details
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`):
  - `t` becomes `(2 * t) % MOD`
  - `ans` becomes `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`

- After the second iteration (`i = 1`):
  - `t` becomes `(4 * t) % MOD` (which is `(2 * (2 * t) % MOD) % MOD`)
  - `ans` becomes `((s + 2*t + 4*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`

- After the third iteration (`i = 2`):
  - `t` becomes `(8 * t) % MOD` (which is `(2 * (4 * t) % MOD) % MOD`)
  - `ans` becomes `((s + 2*t + 4*t + 8*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`

Following this pattern, after `k-1` iterations, the value of `t` will be `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, and `ans` will be `((s + t * (2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

### Summation of Powers of 2
The sum of the geometric series `2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)` can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
\[ \text{Sum} = 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \ldots + 2^{k-1} = 2 \left(\frac{2^{k-1} - 1}{2 - 1}\right) = 2^k - 2 \]

Thus, the final `ans` will be:
\[ \text{ans} = ((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % \text{MOD} + \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} \]

### Final Output State
- `t` will be `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`
- `tmp` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `ans` will be `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.**

In simpler terms, `t` is updated to be `t` multiplied by `2` raised to the power of `k-1` modulo `MOD`, `tmp` stays the same, and `ans` is updated to include the cumulative effect of all the `t` values doubled up to `k-1` times.
