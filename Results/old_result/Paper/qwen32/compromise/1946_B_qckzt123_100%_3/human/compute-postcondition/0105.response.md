To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` and `k`.

Here's the given loop:
```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range `(k - 1)` must be at least 1, meaning `k` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we don't need to adjust its initial value.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `k` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- `i` is automatically set to 0 at the start of the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `tmp`, `ans`, `T`, `n`, `a`, `s`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is the maximum cumulative sum encountered, `tmp` is the final cumulative sum (or 0 if negative), `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the list `a`**
