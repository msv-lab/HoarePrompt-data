The code snippet `t = max(tmp, t)` updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and the current value of `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `max(tmp + x, 0)`
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer, and `a` must have at least one element
- `MOD` is 1000000007
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`
- `x` is the next element in the list `a`
- If `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

After executing the code `t = max(tmp, t)`, the new value of `t` will be the maximum between `tmp` and its previous value `max(tmp + x, 0)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is `max(tmp, max(tmp + x, 0))`, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer, and `a` must have at least one element, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
