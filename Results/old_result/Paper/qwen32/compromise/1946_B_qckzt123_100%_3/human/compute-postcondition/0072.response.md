The code snippet `t %= MOD` modifies the value of `t` to be the remainder when `t` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of `tmp`, `ans`, `k`, or `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`
- `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends
- `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`
- `k` must be greater than 1
- `i` is `k - 2`

After executing `t %= MOD`, the value of `t` remains effectively the same because `t` is already computed as `((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`, which ensures that `t` is within the range `[0, MOD-1]`. Thus, applying `% MOD` again does not change its value.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is `k - 2`**.
