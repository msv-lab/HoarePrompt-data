The given code snippet only modifies the variable `tmp` by adding `x` to it. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `tmp`. However, we can express the new state of `tmp` in terms of its previous value and `x`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is `0 + x`, `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the list `a`**

In natural language: The value of `tmp` is now the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
