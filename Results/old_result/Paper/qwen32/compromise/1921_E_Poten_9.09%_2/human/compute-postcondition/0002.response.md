The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The value of `i` is initialized before the loop starts and is used as the loop variable.

Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop can execute. The value of `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head. However, to make it clear, we can specify that `i` starts at 0.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list**
