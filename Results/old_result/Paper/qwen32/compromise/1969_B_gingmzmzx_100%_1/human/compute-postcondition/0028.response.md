The code snippet `cnt = [0, 0]` resets the `cnt` list to `[0, 0]`. This means the counts of 0s and 1s are both set to zero. Other variables such as `ans`, `n`, `s`, and `zeroes` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is the total score calculated based on the described logic, `n` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`.**
