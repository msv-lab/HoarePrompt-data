To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it processes each binary string `s`.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration:
1. It reads a binary string `s`.
2. It counts the number of `0`s and `1`s in the string.
3. It calculates a score `ans` based on the presence of `0`s and `1`s in the string.

The score `ans` is calculated as follows:
- For each `0` encountered in the string, add `1` to `ans` if there is at least one `1` encountered before it.
- For each `1` encountered in the string, add the number of remaining `0`s (i.e., total number of `0`s minus the number of `0`s encountered so far) to `ans`.

The variables `cnt` and `ans` are recalculated in each iteration, so their final values after all iterations will reflect only the last iteration's string. However, the overall output of the program is the series of `ans` values printed in each iteration.

Given that the output state after the first 3 iterations includes the `cnt` and `ans` values for each iteration, we can infer that the final output state will be the `ans` value for the `n`-th iteration.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for the binary strings `s` or the value of `n`, we cannot compute a numerical value for `ans`. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the loop's behavior.

Output State: **The final `ans` value calculated from the last binary string `s` read in the `n`-th iteration.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the score `ans` computed from the last binary string processed by the loop.
