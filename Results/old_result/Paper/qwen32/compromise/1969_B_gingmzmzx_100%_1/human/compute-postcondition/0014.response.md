The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the list `cnt`. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s`, and `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, this operation will increase the count of either the 0s or 1s in `cnt` by 1, depending on the value of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; `n` is an integer such that `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing the binary string read from the input; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`; `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] but with the count of `c` incremented by 1; if `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is [1, 0], otherwise `ans` is 0; if `c` is not 0, `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`; `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**

In simpler terms, the count of the element `c` in `cnt` has been increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.
