Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[1, 0]` if `c` was `0`, or `[0, 1]` if `c` was `1`. `ans` is `ans + zeroes` if `c` was `1`, otherwise `ans` remains `0`. `n` is decremented by 1. `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 element. `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`.**
