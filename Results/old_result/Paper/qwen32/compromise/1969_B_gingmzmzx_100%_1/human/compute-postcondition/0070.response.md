Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[3, 0]` if `c` is `0`, or `[0, 3]` if `c` is `1`. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `c` is `1`, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is `0`. `n` is decremented by 1. `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 2 elements. `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`. `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
