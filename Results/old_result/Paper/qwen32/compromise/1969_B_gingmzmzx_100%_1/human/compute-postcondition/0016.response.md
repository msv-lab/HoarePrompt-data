Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; `n` is an integer such that `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing the binary string read from the input; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`; `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] but with the count of `c` incremented by 1; if `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is [1, 0], otherwise `ans` is 0; if `c` is not 0, `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`; `c` is the next element in the list `s`; `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
