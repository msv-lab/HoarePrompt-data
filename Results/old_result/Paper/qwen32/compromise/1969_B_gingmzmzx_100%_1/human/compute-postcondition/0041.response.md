Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` with one of the elements incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element. `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`. `c` is the next element in `s`.**
