The code snippet provided imports the lowercase English alphabet into the variable `alphabet`. The initial state includes the variables `t` and `n` with specific constraints, but these are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Since `alphabet` is now defined as the lowercase English alphabet, the output state includes this new definition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
