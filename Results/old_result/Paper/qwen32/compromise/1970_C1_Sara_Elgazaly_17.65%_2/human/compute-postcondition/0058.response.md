The code snippet `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. This means that `x` will now hold the same value as `y`, which is the new last element of `lst[x]` from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst[x]` has one less element, `y` is the new last element of `lst[x]`, `x` is now equal to `y`, `s` is the opposite of its initial value, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list.**
