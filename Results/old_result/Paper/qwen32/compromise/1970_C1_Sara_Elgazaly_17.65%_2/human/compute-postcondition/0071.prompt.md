Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst[x]` is not empty, `y` is the last element popped from `lst[x]`, `x` remains the original `x` unless a `lst[y]` was non-empty and caused a break, `s` is the opposite of its initial value
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst[x]` has one less element, `y` is the new last element of `lst[x]`, `x` remains the original `x` if `lst[y]` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is updated to `y`, and `s` is the opposite of its initial value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `lst[x]` is a list with its last element removed, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, then `x` is equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `lst[x]` contains all elements except the last one that was removed, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, then `x` is set to the value of `y` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x` and the execution continues.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
