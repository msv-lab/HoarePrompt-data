The code snippet `s = not s` toggles the boolean value of `s`. If `s` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and if `s` was `False`, it becomes `True`. The values of `lst[x]`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`lst[x]` is empty, `y` is the last element popped from `lst[x]`, `x` remains the original `x` unless a `lst[y]` was non-empty and caused a break, `s` is the opposite of its initial value.**
