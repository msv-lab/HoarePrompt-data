The code snippet `lst[b].append(a)` modifies the defaultdict `lst` by appending the integer `a` to the list associated with the key `b`. 

Given the initial state, the only change is in the defaultdict `lst` where the value associated with key `b` now includes `a` along with any previous values. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `_`, and the tree structure) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[b]` now includes `a` along with its previous values, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
