The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to the variable `y`. This means that the list `lst[x]` will have one less element after the operation, and `y` will hold the value that was the last element of `lst[x]`.

Given the initial state, `lst[x]` includes at least one element, so after the `pop()` operation, `lst[x]` will still be a list, but with one less element than before. The value of `y` will be the element that was removed from `lst[x]`.

The other variables (`n`, `t`, the tree structure, `u_1, ..., u_t`, `x`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[x]` now has one less element than before, `_` is incremented to `x-1`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `s` is True**.
