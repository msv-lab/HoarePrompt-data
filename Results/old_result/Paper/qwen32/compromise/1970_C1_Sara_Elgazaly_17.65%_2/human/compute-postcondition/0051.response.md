Postcondition: **`lst` is `[[1, 2], ..., [non-empty list except the last element has been removed from lst[3]], ...]`; `y` is the last element of the original `lst[3]`; if `lst[y]` is not an empty list, then `x` is equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `x`.**
