The code snippet provided is `lst[a].append(b)`. This line of code modifies the defaultdict `lst` by appending the value `b` to the list that is the value of the key `a` in the dictionary.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is affected by this line of code is `lst`. The values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `_`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The defaultdict `lst` now includes `b` in the list associated with the key `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default value and `lst[a]` now includes `b` along with its previous values, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
