The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`. Therefore, we need to adjust these based on the current state provided.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `mid` does not change during the loop, so it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input and must be at least 2; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '1', then `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is either 1 or 2, `trightOne` is 0.**
