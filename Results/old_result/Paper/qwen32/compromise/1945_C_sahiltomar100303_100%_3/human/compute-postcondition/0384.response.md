Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `right` is `n`, and `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `s` up to `right = n - 1`. If `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne` remains adjusted to be at least `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `rightOne` is adjusted to be less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
