Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 1; `tleftZero` is 2; `trightZero` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
