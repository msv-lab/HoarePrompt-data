Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is an input integer; if `left` is 0, the counts `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain as described in the precondition; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is 0, `trightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` with no additional changes, or `trightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`; if `left` is not 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` up to `right`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` up to `right`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` up to `right`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` up to `right`, and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, or the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` is less than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left`; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 1; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 2; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is 2; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 3 if `s[i] == '0'`, otherwise `leftZero` is 1; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 1 if `s[i] == '0'`, otherwise `leftOne` is 2 if `s[i] == '0'` or 3 if `s[i] != '0'`; `rightOne` is 0 if `s[i] == '0'`, otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[i] == '0'`, otherwise `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[i] == '0'`, otherwise `tleftOne` is 2 if `s[i] == '0'` or 3 if `s[i] != '0'`; `trightOne` is 0 if `s[i] == '0'`, otherwise `trightOne` is 1; `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
