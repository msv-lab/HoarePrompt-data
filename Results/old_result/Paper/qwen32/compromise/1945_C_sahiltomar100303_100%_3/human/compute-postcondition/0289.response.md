Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is 0; `s[i]` is not '0'**

Natural language description: The variable `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
