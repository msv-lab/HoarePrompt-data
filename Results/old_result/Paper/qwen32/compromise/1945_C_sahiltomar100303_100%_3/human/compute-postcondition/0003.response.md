The value of `s` is assigned the value of the string read from the input. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input; `s` is a string read from input.
Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input; `s` is a string read from input.**
