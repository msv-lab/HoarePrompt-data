The code snippet assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `left`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `left` will now be equal to `mid`, which is `n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `left` is `mid`.**
