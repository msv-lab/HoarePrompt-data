Output State: **`s[right]` is '0', `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the bounds of `s` where the character at position `right` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the character at index `right` in the string `s` remains '0'. The variable `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, and the variable `trightZero` has been decremented by 1. All other conditions remain unchanged.
