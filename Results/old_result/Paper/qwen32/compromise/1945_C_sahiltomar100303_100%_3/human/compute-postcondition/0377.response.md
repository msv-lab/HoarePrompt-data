Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is not equal to `n`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `s` up to `right = n - 1`. The current value of `right` is less than `n`.**
