To determine what will be printed by the `print(left)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values and conditions of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true.
- `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of the string `s` up to `right`.
- `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of the string `s` up to `right`.
- `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of the string `s` up to `right`.
- `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of the string `s` up to `right`.
- `left` is set to 0.
- `right` is initially set to `n` (the length of the string `s`).
- `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `left` is explicitly set to 0 in the initial state.
- The conditions and calculations involving `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are used to determine the value of `right` but do not affect the value of `left`.

### Conclusion:
Since `left` is explicitly set to 0 and there are no operations or conditions that modify `left` before the `print(left)` statement, the value of `left` remains 0.

Output: **0**
