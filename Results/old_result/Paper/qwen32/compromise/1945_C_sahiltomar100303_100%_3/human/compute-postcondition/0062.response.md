Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0; `left` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0'**

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
