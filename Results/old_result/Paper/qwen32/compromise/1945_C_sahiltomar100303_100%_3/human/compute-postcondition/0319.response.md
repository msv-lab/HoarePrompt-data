The code snippet increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Based on the initial state, if `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is initially set to `2`. Therefore, after executing `rightZero += 1`, `rightZero` becomes `3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `leftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `tleftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `tleftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `i` is `mid + 2`; `rightZero` is `3`; `trightZero` is `3`. If `s[i]` is '0', `rightOne` is not defined; otherwise, `rightOne` is `3` and `trightOne` is `4`.**
