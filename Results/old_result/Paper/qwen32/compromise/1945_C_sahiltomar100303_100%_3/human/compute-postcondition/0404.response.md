Postcondition: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is either `n` or not `n`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `s` up to `right = n - 1`. If `left` is 0 and `right` was not equal to `n` before the if-else block, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is 0 and `right` was equal to `n` before the if-else block, `rightOne` is adjusted to be less than `(n + 1) // 2` if it was less than that value, otherwise it remains adjusted to be at least `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, and if `right` is `n` and `left` is 0, `tleftZero` meets or exceeds the threshold `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not `n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is compared to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, and the condition in the if part holds if the former is less than or equal to the latter.**
