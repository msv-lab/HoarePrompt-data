Postcondition: **`left` is not equal to 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is either `n` or not `n`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `s` up to `right = n - 1`. If `right` is `n` and `left` is 0, then `tleftZero` meets or exceeds the threshold `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not `n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is compared to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, and the condition in the if part holds if the former is less than or equal to the latter.**
