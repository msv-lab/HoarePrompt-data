The initial state provides the values of several variables, including `left`, which is explicitly given as 0. The `print(left)` statement will output the value of the `left` variable.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `left` is explicitly defined in the initial state as 0.
2. The `print(left)` statement will output the value of the `left` variable.

Since the value of `left` is explicitly provided and there are no conditions or formulas affecting its value in the given context, we can directly use this value in the output.

Output: **0**
