Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 2 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is 1`**

In natural language: The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` was not '0', `leftOne` is now 2; otherwise, it is 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
