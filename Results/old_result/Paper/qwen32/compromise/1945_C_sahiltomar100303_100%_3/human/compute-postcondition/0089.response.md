Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 1. If the character at position `right` in `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is 0. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is 2, and `trightOne` is 0.**
