Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is 2.
- `s` is "10".
- `mid` is 1.
- `leftZero` is 0.
- `rightZero` is 1.
- `leftOne` is 0.
- `rightOne` is 1.
- `left` is not equal to 0.
- `leftMove` is 0.
- `right` is 2.
- `tleftZero` is 1.
- `trightZero` is 0.
- `tleftOne` is 0.
- `trightOne` is 1.
- `right` equals `n`.
- The current value of `left` is not equal to 0.

### Print Statement:
```
print(left)
```

### Analysis:
From the initial state, we know that `left` is not explicitly given a numerical value, but it is stated that `left` is not equal to 0. However, we are not provided with any specific value for `left` other than it being non-zero. Given the context and the constraints, we can infer that `left` must be a value that satisfies the conditions provided, but the exact numerical value is not specified.

Since the problem does not provide a specific value for `left`, we can only state that `left` is a non-zero integer. However, based on the provided initial state and the typical context of such problems, `left` is often initialized to a specific value that fits the constraints. Given that `right` is 2 and `mid` is 1, a common initialization for `left` in such binary string or array problems is 1.

### Conclusion:
Given the typical initialization and the constraints, the most reasonable value for `left` in this context is 1. Therefore, the print statement will output 1.

Output: **1**
