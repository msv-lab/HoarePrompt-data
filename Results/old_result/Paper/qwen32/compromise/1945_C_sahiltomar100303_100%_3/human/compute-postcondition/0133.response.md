Postcondition: **t is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; n is 2; s is "10"; mid is 1; leftZero is 0; rightZero is 1; leftOne is 0; rightOne is 1; left is not equal to 0; leftMove is 0; right is not equal to n (specifically, right is 2, but the condition right == n is false); tleftZero is 1; trightZero is 0; tleftOne is 0; trightOne is 1. The absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is compared to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right. If the former is less than or equal to the latter, the condition in the if part holds; otherwise, the condition in the else part holds.**
