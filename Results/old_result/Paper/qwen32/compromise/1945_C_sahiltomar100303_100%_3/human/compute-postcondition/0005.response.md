The code snippet provided initializes a variable `leftZero` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `mid` are not altered by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0.**
