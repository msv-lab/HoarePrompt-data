The code snippet `left -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `left` by 1. Given the initial state, `left` is 1. After decrementing, `left` becomes 0.

The value of `leftZero` depends on the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s`. Initially, `left` is 1, so `leftZero` is determined by `s[0]`, which is '1'. Since `s[0]` is '1', `leftZero` is 0. After `left` is decremented to 0, `leftZero` is recalculated based on `s[-1]` (the last character of the string `s`), which is '0'. Therefore, `leftZero` becomes -1.

Similarly, `leftOne` is initially 0 because `s[0]` is '1'. After `left` is decremented to 0, `leftOne` is recalculated based on `s[-1]`, which is '0'. Therefore, `leftOne` becomes 0.

The values of `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are not affected by the decrement of `left`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `leftZero` is -1; `rightZero` is 3; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is either 1 or 2; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0.**
