Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 1; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is 0; the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0'.**

Natural Language: The value of `leftZero` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
