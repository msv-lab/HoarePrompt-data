The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range of the loop is determined by `mid`, which is calculated as `n // 2`. For the loop to execute, `mid` must be at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 2. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input and must be at least 2; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is 0**
