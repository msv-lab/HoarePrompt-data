Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `rightZero` is 2 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 1, and is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0'; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is 1 more than its previous value if `s[i]` is not '0'; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `trightZero` is either 4 or 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 3 or 1; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is 1 more than its previous value if `s[i]` is not '0'; `i` is `i + 1`**

In simpler terms: The value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1, so if it was 1, it is now 2, and if it was 0, it is now 1. The values of `trightZero` have also been incremented by 1, so if it was 3 or 1, it is now 4 or 2, and if it was 2 or 0, it is now 3 or 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
