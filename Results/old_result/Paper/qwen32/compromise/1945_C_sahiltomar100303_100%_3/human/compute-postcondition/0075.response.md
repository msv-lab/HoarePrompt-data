The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `rightZero` is 2, after the increment, `rightZero` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; `leftZero` is -1; `rightZero` is 3; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is either 1 or 2; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0**
