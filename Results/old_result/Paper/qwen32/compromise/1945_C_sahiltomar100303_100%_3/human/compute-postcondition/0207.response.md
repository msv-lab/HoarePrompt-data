Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` minus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` minus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `left` is `mid - 2`.**

The variable `left` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `mid - 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
