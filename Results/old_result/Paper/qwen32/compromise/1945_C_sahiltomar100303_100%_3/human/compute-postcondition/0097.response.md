Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 2 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise `trightOne` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, making `right` equal to 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
