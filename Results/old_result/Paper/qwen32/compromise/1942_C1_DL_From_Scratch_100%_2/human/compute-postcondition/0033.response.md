Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is at least 2, `y` is the third integer from the new input, `list0` is the new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `count` is 1, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, and `num` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
