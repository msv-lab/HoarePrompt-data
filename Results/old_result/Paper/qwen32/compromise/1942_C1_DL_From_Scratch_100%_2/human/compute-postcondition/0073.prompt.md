Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5); `y` is 0; The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` was exactly 2, plus 1 if `num` was 1, and `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`. If `num` was 1, `count` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is T-1, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is the first integer from the new input, x is the second integer from the new input, y is the third integer from the new input, list0 is the new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, i is x - 2, num is 1 if it was equal to 1 during the loop execution (in which case count is increased by 1), otherwise num retains its original value and count remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is T-2, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is the first integer from the new input, x is the second integer from the new input, y is the third integer from the new input, list0 is the new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, i is x - 2, num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1, and count is the total number of times num was 1 during all iterations. If num is 1, count is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
