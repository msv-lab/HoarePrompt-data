The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `list0`. The variables `T`, `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `list0` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
