The given code snippet updates the `costs` list by applying the `func_1` function to each row in the `rows` list with the parameter `d`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the code snippet. The `rows` list also remains unchanged as the function `func_1` is applied to each row but does not modify the `rows` list itself.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist (row) contains `m` integers read from the input, and `costs` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.**
