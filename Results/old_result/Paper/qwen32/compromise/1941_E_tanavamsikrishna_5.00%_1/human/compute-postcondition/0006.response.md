To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and understand how the variables `total_costs` and its minimum value are derived.

1. **Inputs and Initial Variables:**
   - `n`: The first input integer (not directly used in the given code snippet).
   - `m`: The second input integer, representing the number of integers in each row of the 2D list `rows`.
   - `k`: The third input integer, representing the number of consecutive elements to sum from the `costs` list to form `total_costs`.
   - `d`: The fourth input integer, used in the `func_1` function to compute the `costs` list.
   - `rows`: A 2D list of integers, where each sublist (row) contains `m` integers.
   - `costs`: A list of integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.
   - `total_costs`: A list of integers, where each integer is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

2. **Derivation of `costs` List:**
   - Each element in the `costs` list is computed by applying the `func_1(row, d)` function to each row in the `rows` list.
   - The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot compute the exact values of `costs`. However, we know that `costs` is a list of integers derived from the rows and the value of `d`.

3. **Derivation of `total_costs` List:**
   - `total_costs` is a list of sums of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - For example, if `costs` is `[c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]` and `k` is 3, then `total_costs` will be `[c1+c2+c3, c2+c3+c4, c3+c4+c5]`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Value in `total_costs`:**
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest value in the `total_costs` list.
   - Since the exact values of `costs` and `total_costs` depend on the input values and the `func_1` function, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the minimum `total_costs`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the `total_costs` list.

Based on the above analysis, the output will be the minimum value in the `total_costs` list, which is a list of sums of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list, and costs is a list of integers derived from the rows and the value of d)**
