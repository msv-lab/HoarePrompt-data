Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist (row) contains `m` integers read from the input, `costs` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`, `total_costs` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `total_costs` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
