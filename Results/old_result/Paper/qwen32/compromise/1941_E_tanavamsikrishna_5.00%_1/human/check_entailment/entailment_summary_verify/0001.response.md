To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem involves building `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a grid representing a river. Each bridge must have supports in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`. The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`. The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for all `k` bridges.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`
This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row `row` with the given maximum distance `d` between supports.

- **Initialization**:
  - The first `d-1` supports are installed at the beginning of the row, and their costs are calculated as `a_{i, j} + 1`.
  - **Issue**: The first `d-1` supports are not necessarily the only supports in the first `d-1` cells. The function should ensure that a support is placed in the first cell and then consider placing additional supports within the first `d` cells.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
  - For each subsequent cell, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds the cost of placing a support in the current cell, which is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
  - **Issue**: The function does not ensure that a support is placed in the last cell of the row.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function handles multiple test cases:
- **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
- **Cost Calculation**: For each row in the grid, it calculates the cost of installing supports using `func_1`.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these costs in `total_costs`.
- **Output**: It prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.

### Function Summary Recap
The summary suggests that `func_2` reads input values including the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), maximum distance between supports (`d`), a 2D list of integers (`rows`), and calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`. It then computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums. 

### Issues Identified

1. **Initialization in `func_1`**:
   - The first `d-1` supports are not correctly initialized. The first and last supports are mandatory, and the function should ensure that the first and last cells always have supports.
   - The function should handle the placement of supports more carefully to ensure that the constraints are met.

2. **Dynamic Programming in `func_1`**:
   - The function does not guarantee that a support is placed in the last cell of the row.
   - The function should ensure that the last cell always has a support and consider the cost accordingly.

### Conclusion
Given the identified issues, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program does not correctly handle the placement of supports in the first and last cells and does not ensure that the constraints are met for all rows.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
