Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The problem requires us to build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a grid representing a river, with each bridge having supports that satisfy certain conditions:
- A support must be installed in the first and last columns.
- The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for all `k` bridges.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Provided Program

#### Function `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`
This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row `row` with the given maximum distance `d` between supports.

- **Initialization**: The first `d-1` supports are installed at the beginning of the row, and their costs are calculated as `a_{i, j} + 1`.
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: For each subsequent cell, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds the cost of placing a support in the current cell, which is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

The function returns the cost of installing supports for the entire row.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function handles multiple test cases:
- **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
- **Cost Calculation**: For each row in the grid, it calculates the cost of installing supports using `func_1`.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these costs in `total_costs`.
- **Output**: It prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.

### Step 3: Verifying the Approach
- **Dynamic Programming in `func_1`**: The approach used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost of supports for a single row with the given constraints. It ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d` by considering only the previous `d` cells.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly reads multiple test cases and calculates the minimum total cost for each test case by considering all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Step 4: Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the approach to solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows across all test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
