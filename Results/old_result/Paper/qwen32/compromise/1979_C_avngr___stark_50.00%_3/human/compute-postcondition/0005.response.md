The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, which means it starts with the second element of the `numbers` list and continues with the subsequent elements.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is `k_1`, which is the second element after `n` in the `numbers` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in the list after `k_1`.

Given the structure of the `numbers` list:
- The first element is `t` (number of test cases).
- The second element is `n` (number of outcomes for the first test case).
- The next `n` elements are the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

Since `num` is currently `k_1`, the next value for `num` should be `k_2`.

State: **`numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, the second element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes for the first test case, and the next `n` elements are the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of `t` and `k_1`, `num` is `k_2`**
