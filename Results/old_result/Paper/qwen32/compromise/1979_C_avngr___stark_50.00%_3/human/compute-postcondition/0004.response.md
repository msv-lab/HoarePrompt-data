The code snippet `hcf = gcd(hcf, num)` updates the value of `hcf` to be the greatest common divisor of the current `hcf` and `num`. Given that `num` is initialized to `k_1`, the new value of `hcf` will be the greatest common divisor of `hcf` (which is initially the greatest common divisor of `t` and `k_1`) and `k_1` itself. Since `hcf` is already the greatest common divisor of `t` and `k_1`, the value of `hcf` will not change after this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State with respect to the values of `hcf`, `num`, and other variables.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, the second element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes for the first test case, and the next `n` elements are the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of `t` and `k_1`, `num` is `k_1`**.
