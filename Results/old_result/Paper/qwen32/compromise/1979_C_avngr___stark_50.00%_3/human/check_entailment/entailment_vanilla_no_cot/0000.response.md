Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program attempts to solve the problem by computing a set of bets based on the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then normalizing these bets by their greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the logic to determine if a valid set of bets exists and to compute these bets is flawed.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **LCM Calculation:** The program calculates a product of all multipliers `k` as `m`. This is not the LCM but rather the product of all `k_i`. While this product can be used to calculate a set of bets, it does not guarantee that the bets will satisfy the condition for all outcomes.

2. **Normalization by GCD:** The program divides each bet by the GCD of the bets to simplify the numbers. However, this does not ensure that the total bet is less than the payout for any winning outcome.

3. **Condition Check:** The program checks if the sum of the bets is less than the product of all `k` divided by the GCD. This condition is not sufficient to ensure that the bets are valid for all outcomes.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. One way to achieve this is to set the bet for the i-th outcome to `m / k_i - 1` where `m` is the LCM of all `k_i`. This ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_multiple(numbers):
    return reduce(lcm, numbers)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = lcm_multiple(k)
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        if m // k[i] <= 1:
            print(-1)
            break
        c.append(m // k[i] - 1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, c)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **LCM Calculation:** The program calculates the LCM of all `k_i` using the `lcm_multiple` function.

2. **Bet Calculation:** For each outcome, the bet is set to `m // k_i - 1`. This ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome.

3. **Condition Check:** If `m // k_i` is less than or equal to 1, it is impossible to find a valid bet for that outcome, and the program outputs `-1`.

This corrected program ensures that the bets are valid for all outcomes and meets the problem's requirements.
