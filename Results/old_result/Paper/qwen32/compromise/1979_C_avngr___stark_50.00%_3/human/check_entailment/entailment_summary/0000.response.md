### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and the problem description carefully.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Distribute bets (coins) across `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome.
2. **Input**:
   - Number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Number of outcomes `n`.
     - List of multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
3. **Output**:
   - If a valid distribution exists, output `n` integers representing the bets.
   - If no such distribution exists, output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of multipliers `k_i`.
2. **Calculating Common Multiples**:
   - It calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i` for a given test case.
   - It computes a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is `m` divided by the corresponding multiplier `k_i`.
3. **Reducing the List**:
   - It finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) `hcf` of the elements in `c`.
   - It divides each element in `c` by `hcf` to simplify the list.
4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - It checks if the sum of the simplified list `c` is less than `m / hcf`.
   - If true, it prints the simplified list `c` as the bets.
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

#### Key Points:
- The program uses the fact that if we bet `m / k_i` on the i-th outcome, the total bet is `m`, and the winnings for the i-th outcome are `k_i * (m / k_i) = m`. However, since we need the total bet to be strictly less than the winnings for any outcome, we need to reduce the bets while maintaining the condition.
- By dividing each `c[i]` by the GCD of all `c[i]`, the program ensures that the bets are minimized but still satisfy the condition.
- The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome. The program also correctly handles the case where no such distribution is possible.

### Correctness:
**True**
