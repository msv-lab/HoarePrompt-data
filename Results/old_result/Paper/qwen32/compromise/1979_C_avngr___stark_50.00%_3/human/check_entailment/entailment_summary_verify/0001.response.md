### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute bets \( x_i \) such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, i.e., \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) for all \( i \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_i \) are read.

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The program calculates the product of all \( k_i \) values, which serves as a common multiple but not necessarily the least common multiple (LCM). This value is stored in `m`.

3. **Generating Initial Bets:**
   - The program generates initial bets \( c_i \) by dividing the product `m` by each multiplier \( k_i \). This is stored in the list `c`.

4. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - The program calculates the GCD of all elements in the list `c` using the `func_1` function. This GCD is stored in the variable `hcf`.

5. **Normalizing Bets:**
   - The program normalizes the bets by dividing each element in `c` by the GCD `hcf`.

6. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than the product `m` divided by the GCD `hcf`. If the sum is not less, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If the sum is less, it prints the normalized bets.

#### Correctness Analysis:
The key issue lies in the logic for checking the feasibility of the bets. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` does not correctly ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Let's break it down:

- **LCM vs. Product:** The program uses the product of all \( k_i \) values, not the LCM. While the product ensures that \( c_i \) are integers, it does not guarantee the smallest possible values.

- **Normalization:** Dividing by the GCD reduces the bets, but the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not correct for ensuring the required inequality.

- **Correct Feasibility Check:** The correct condition should be ensuring that for all \( i \), \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \). This means that for each \( i \), \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i < k_i \cdot c_i \).

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the LCM of the \( k_i \) values.
2. Generating bets \( c_i \) by dividing the LCM by each \( k_i \).
3. Ensuring that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the smallest possible return, which is \( \min(k_i \cdot c_i) \).

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not sufficient and can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the feasibility of the bets. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not sufficient to ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

**Final: False**
