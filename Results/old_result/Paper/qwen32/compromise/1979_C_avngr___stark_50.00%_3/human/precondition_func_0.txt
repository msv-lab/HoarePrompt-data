numbers is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
