The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers in ascending order, converts each integer to a string, joins them with spaces, and prints the resulting string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the output for each test case.
