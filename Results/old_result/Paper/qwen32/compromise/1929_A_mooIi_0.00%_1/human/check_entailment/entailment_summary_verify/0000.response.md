**Reasoning:**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array elements, which is not the required behavior.

To maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, the array should be rearranged in a specific way. A common and effective strategy is to sort the array and then interleave the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then constructing a new array by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.

For example, given the input array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the correct steps would be:
1. Sort the array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
2. Rearrange to maximize differences: `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]`
3. Calculate the beauty: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 90) = 57`

The provided program does not perform these steps. Instead, it simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not yield the maximum beauty.

**Final: False**
