Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. However, the current implementation of the function only sorts the array and prints it. It does not calculate and print the beauty of the array, which is the required output.

The correct approach would be to sort the array, then compute the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements, and finally print this sum for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
