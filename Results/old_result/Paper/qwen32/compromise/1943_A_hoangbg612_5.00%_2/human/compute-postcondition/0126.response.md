Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, and `num` is `num_next`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and the loop or if statement continues.**
