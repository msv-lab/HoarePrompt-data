The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `cur` is either `num` if `num` is greater than -1, or -1 if `num` is less than or equal to -1, after incrementing, `cur` will be `num + 1` if `num` was greater than -1, or 0 if `num` was -1. The states of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain the same.

Output State: **`cur` is `num + 1` if `num` was greater than -1, or 0 if `num` was -1; `T` remains unchanged; `S` remains unchanged; `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than -1, or an empty dictionary if `num` is less than or equal to -1; `num` is the next element in `N` after the previous `num`.**
