Output State: **`num` is greater than `cur`, and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `num` and `cur` remain unchanged. The condition that `num` is greater than `cur` and `num` is greater than `cur + 1` still holds true. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
