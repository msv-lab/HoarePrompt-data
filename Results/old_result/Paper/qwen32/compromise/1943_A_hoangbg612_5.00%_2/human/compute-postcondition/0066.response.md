The code assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, the dictionary `M` will have an entry with the key `num` and the value `1`. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cur` is `num`; `T` remains unchanged; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}`.**
