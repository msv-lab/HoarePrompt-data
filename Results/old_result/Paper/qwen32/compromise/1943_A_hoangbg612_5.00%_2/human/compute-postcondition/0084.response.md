The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Given that `cur` is `num`, the value at `M[num]` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`, `M[num]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `M` has been increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
