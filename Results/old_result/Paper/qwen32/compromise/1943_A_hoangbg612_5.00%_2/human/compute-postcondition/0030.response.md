Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `N` that must have at least one more element, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `M` is a dictionary.**
In natural language: The value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`, while `num` and `M` remain unchanged. The precondition that `N` must have at least one more element still holds.
