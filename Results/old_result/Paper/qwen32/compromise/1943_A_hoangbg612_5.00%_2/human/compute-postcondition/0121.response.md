The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` attempts to increment the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` is -1, and `M` is an empty dictionary. This means that `M[cur]` does not exist yet, and trying to increment it will result in a `KeyError`.

However, if we assume the code is intended to handle the case where the key might not exist by initializing it to 0 before incrementing, we can proceed with that assumption.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `cur` is -1.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `M` is an empty dictionary.
- `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.

The code `M[cur] += 1` can be interpreted as:
- If `cur` (-1) is not in `M`, add it with a value of 0, then increment it by 1.
- If `cur` (-1) is already in `M`, increment its value by 1.

Since `M` is initially empty, `M[cur]` will be added with a value of 0, and then incremented to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `cur` is -1; `T` remains unchanged; `S` is an input integer; `M` is {-1: 1}; `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.**
