The code snippet provided is a `break` statement. This statement causes the program to exit the current loop or switch statement. Since the `break` statement does not affect any variables directly, the values of `cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is `num + 1`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.**
