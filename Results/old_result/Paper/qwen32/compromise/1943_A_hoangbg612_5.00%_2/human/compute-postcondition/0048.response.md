Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `cur` is now the same as the value of `i` after `i` has been incremented by 1. The condition that `cur` was initially greater than `i + 1` is no longer relevant since `cur` has been updated to the new value of `i`.
