The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value stored at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. The precondition states that `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, but this condition does not affect the execution of the given code snippet directly. The only change made by the code is to the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

Output State: **State remains as given in the precondition, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`; the value of `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**
