The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. This change affects the value of `cur` directly, but the values of other variables (`N`, `T`, `S`, `num`, `num_next`, and `M`) remain unchanged as per the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after `num_next`. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num_next` and `M[num_next]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`. `cur` is incremented by 1.**
