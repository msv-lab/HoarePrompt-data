The variable `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. The other variables `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged. The condition `num > cur + 1` is not re-evaluated, and the loop or if statement is not broken out of based on this code snippet alone.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than -1, or an empty dictionary if `num` is less than or equal to -1.**
