The value of `cur` is updated to the current value of `i`. The initial condition that `cur` is greater than 0 is no longer necessarily true as `cur` now takes the value of `i`. The state of `i` being incremented by 1 is preserved, but it does not affect `cur` directly in this snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is now equal to `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
