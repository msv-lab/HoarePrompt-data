The code snippet provided is `M = {}`, which reassigns the variable `M` to an empty dictionary. This action does not affect the values of `N`, `cur`, `T`, or `S`. The only change is that `M` is now an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `cur` is -1; `T` remains unchanged; `S` is an input integer; `M` is an empty dictionary.**
