Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `M` is a dictionary. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`. The conditions regarding the comparison between `num` and `cur + 1` and the potential increment and break statement remain as they were, but `cur` is now set to `num`.
