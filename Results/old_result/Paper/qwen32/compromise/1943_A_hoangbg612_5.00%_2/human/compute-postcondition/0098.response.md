Postcondition: **`cur` is `i` if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, otherwise `cur` remains `i + 1`. `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, and `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
