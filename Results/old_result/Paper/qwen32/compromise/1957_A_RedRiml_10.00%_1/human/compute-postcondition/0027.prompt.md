Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is a list that may contain `i` as its last element if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is a list that may contain `i` as its last element if `i` was not already in `pl` and now `pl` includes the value of `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` following its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is a list that includes the value of `i` as its last element if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` following its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
