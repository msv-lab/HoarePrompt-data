The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list containing the element `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. The current value of `i` is in `pl`. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.**
