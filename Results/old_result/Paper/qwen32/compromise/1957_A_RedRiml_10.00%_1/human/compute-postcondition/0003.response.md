The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `palka`. This means that the variable `palka` will now hold the list of integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input.**
