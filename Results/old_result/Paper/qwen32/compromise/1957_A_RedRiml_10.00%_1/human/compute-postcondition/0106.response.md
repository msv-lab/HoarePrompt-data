Postcondition: **`shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element and `d[i]` is now 1; otherwise, `d[i]` is now `d[i] + 1`.**
