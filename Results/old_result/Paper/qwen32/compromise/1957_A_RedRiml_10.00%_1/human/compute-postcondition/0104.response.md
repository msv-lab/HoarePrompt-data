Postcondition: **`shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `pl` remains unchanged unless `i` is not in `pl`, in which case `i` is appended to `pl`. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now has `i` mapped to `1`; otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1. Specifically, if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, `d[i]` is now 1; otherwise, `d[i]` is now `d[i] + 1`.**
