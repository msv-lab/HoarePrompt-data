The code assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that `d` will now contain the key-value pair `{i: 1}`. The other variables (`shapes`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{i: 1}`.**
