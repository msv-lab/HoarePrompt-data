The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given that `i` is the next element in the list `palka` after the current `i`, and `d` is a dictionary, we can infer that the value of `d[i]` will be increased by 1.

Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`, `d` is a dictionary with the value of `d[i]` increased by 1, `pl` remains unchanged.**
