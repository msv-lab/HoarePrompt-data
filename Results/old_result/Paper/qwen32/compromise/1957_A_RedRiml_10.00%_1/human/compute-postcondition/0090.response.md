The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given that `d.get(i)` is not None, it means that the key `i` already exists in the dictionary `d` with some value.

Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `w` is decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an updated dictionary where the value associated with the key `i` is incremented by 1.**
