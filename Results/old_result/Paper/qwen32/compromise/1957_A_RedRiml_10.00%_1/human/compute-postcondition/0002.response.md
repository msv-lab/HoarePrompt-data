Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `ln` is assigned the value of an input integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w`) remain unchanged.
