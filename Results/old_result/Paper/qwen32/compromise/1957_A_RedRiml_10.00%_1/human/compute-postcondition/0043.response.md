The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `palka`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `palka`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged.
- `w` remains an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, but it is decremented by 1, so `w` is now `w - 1`.
- `ln` remains an input integer (newly assigned).
- `palka` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, but since `palka` has just been reassigned, `pl` is no longer valid and needs to be recalculated.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, but since `palka` has just been reassigned, `d` is no longer valid and needs to be recalculated.
- `shapes` is the count of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times, but since `palka` has just been reassigned, `shapes` is no longer valid and needs to be recalculated.

Given these points, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl`, `d`, and `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`.**
