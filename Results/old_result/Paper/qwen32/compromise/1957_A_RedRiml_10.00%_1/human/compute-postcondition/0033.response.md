The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop iterates over each element in the list `pl`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next element in `pl`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.
- `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `ln` is an input integer.
- `palka` is a list of integers read from the input that must contain at least one element.
- `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
- If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is 1; otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.

Let's assume that `j` was the current element being processed in the previous iteration. To move to the next iteration, `j` should be the next element in `pl`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input that must contain at least one element; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`; `j` is the next element in `pl`; if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is 1; otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**

To be more specific, if `j` was the `k`-th element in `pl` during the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `j` should be the `(k+1)`-th element in `pl`. However, since we don't know the exact position of `j` in `pl` from the given state, we simply denote it as "the next element in `pl`".
