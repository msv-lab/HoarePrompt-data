Output State: **`d[j_next]` is an integer. If `d[j_next]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is increased by 2. `j` is the next element in `pl`.**

Explanation: The value of `shapes` is increased by 1 due to the executed line `shapes += 1`. Since the initial state specifies that `shapes` is increased by either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `d[j_next]`, after the additional increment, `shapes` is increased by 3 if `d[j_next]` is greater than or equal to 3, or by 2 otherwise. The values of `d[j_next]`, `j`, and `pl` remain unchanged.
