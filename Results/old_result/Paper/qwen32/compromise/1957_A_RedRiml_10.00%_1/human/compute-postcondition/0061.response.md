To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `palka`, so only the state of `palka` and the loop variable `i` can be adjusted.

Here's the analysis:

- The loop variable `i` is the current element being processed from the list `palka`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last processed element of `palka`.
- For the loop to continue, `palka` must have more elements to process.
- The next value of `i` should be the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- There is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.
- `w` is `w - 1`.
- `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned).
- `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer.
- If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now contains `i` as its last element.
- `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has a value of `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value is incremented by `1`.
- `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`.
- `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element.

Since the loop processes each element of `palka` one by one, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element. The list `palka` itself does not change; it just moves to the next element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` now contains the previously processed `i` as its last element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has a value of `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value is incremented by `1`; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element.**
