The code snippet initializes a variable `shapes` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `shapes` variable with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`; `shapes` is 0.**
