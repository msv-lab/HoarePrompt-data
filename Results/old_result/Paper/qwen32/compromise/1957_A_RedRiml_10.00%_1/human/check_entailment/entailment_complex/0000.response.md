### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it to the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and then reads the lengths of these sticks into a list (`palka`).

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is used to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Determining Possible Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths stored in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`), it increments the `shapes` counter by 1.
   - This implies that for each unique stick length that appears at least 3 times, the program counts it as a potential polygon (though it doesn't specify the exact type of polygon, just that it's possible to form one).

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program outputs the value of `shapes`, which represents the number of unique stick lengths that can form at least one regular polygon.

### Comparison with Problem Requirements:

- **Polygon Formation:** The problem requires forming regular polygons where each side is exactly one stick, and no stick is reused. The program correctly identifies that a regular polygon can be formed if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length.
- **Counting Unique Lengths:** The program counts each unique stick length that can form a polygon, which aligns with the requirement to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed simultaneously.
- **Output:** The output matches the expected result for the given examples. For instance, in the third test case, there is one set of 4 sticks of length 3, which can form a square (one polygon). In the fourth test case, there are two sets: one set of 5 sticks of length 2 (which can form a pentagon) and another set of 4 sticks of length 4 (which can form a square).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks, based on the provided examples and the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
