### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and optimal play from both players. Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To transform the list of piles into a list where each element represents the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - **Process**:
     - It first removes duplicates from the list `a` and sorts the unique values.
     - Then, it calculates the differences between consecutive values in this sorted list.
   - **Example**:
     - For the input `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the function returns `[3]` because all piles have the same size.
     - For the input `[1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`, the function returns `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 91]` after removing duplicates and sorting, and then calculating the differences.

2. **Function `func_2(a, n)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To determine the winner based on the transformed list `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - **Process**:
     - It uses recursion to determine the winner.
     - The base cases handle scenarios with 1 or 2 piles.
     - For more than 2 piles, it recursively calls itself with the rest of the list and determines the winner based on the result of the recursive call and the first element of the current list.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Function `func_1(a)`**:
  - The transformation done by `func_1` is not directly related to the Nim-sum or any known winning strategy for this specific game variant.
  - It seems to be an attempt to simplify the problem, but the transformation does not correctly reflect the game state or the optimal moves.

- **Function `func_2(a, n)`**:
  - The logic in `func_2` is also not correctly implementing any known strategy for this game.
  - The recursive calls and conditions do not align with the rules of the game and the optimal play strategy.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the rules and optimal play. The transformation in `func_1` and the decision-making in `func_2` do not align with the game's mechanics.
