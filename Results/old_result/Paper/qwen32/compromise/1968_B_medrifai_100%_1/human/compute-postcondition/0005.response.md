Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b). The function returns the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the string `b`, starting from index `j`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from index `j`, the function returns -1.**
