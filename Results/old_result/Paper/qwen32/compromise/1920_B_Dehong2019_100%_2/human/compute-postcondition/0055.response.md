The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 2`.

State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + 2`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value.**
