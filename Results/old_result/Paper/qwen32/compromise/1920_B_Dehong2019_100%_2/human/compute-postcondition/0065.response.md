The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans1` to be the sum of the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + k - 1`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations.**
