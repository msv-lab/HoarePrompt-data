The code calculates the sum of all elements in the sorted list `a` and assigns it to the variable `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `ans1` holds the sum of the elements in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.**
