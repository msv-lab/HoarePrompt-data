The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the element at the index `i + x` in the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the element `a[i + x]` is `a[1 + x]`. Therefore, `ans1` is decreased by `a[1 + x] * 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans1` is the previous `ans1` plus `a[1]` minus `a[1 + x] * 2`; `i` is 1; `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans1` plus `a[1]`.**
