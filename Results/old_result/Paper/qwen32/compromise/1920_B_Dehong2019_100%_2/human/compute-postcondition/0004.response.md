The code reads a list of integers from the input, sorts them in descending order, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.**
