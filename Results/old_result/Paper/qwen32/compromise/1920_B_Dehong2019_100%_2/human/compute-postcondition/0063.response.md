The given Python code snippet reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` from the input. This affects the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` directly, but does not modify the values of other variables like `t`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, or `ans2`.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + k - 1`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first `x` elements of `a`)` plus the sum of `a[i]` for `i` from `x` to `x + k - 1`, minus `2 * a[i + x]` for each `i` where `i + x < n`; `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations.**
