The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` from `ans1`. Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order and `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element in the list `a`.

The initial state tells us that `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the first element of `a`. After executing the code, `ans1` will be reduced by an additional `2 * a[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the first element of `a` and twice the second element of `a`; `i` is 1.**
