The code snippet provided subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. Given the initial state, `ans1` is the sum of the list `a`. After executing the code, `ans1` will be reduced by `2 * a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i`, `ans2` are not modified by this snippet; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * a[i]`.**
