Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input with `x` greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + 1`; if `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 4`; `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`; `k` is greater than 0. If `i + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2` and `ans2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `ans1` is adjusted by subtracting `a[i + x] * 2` again, making the total adjustment `a[i] - a[i + x] * 4` if `i + x` is less than `n`. If `i + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` is adjusted by `a[i] - a[i + x] * 2` and `ans2` remains unchanged.
