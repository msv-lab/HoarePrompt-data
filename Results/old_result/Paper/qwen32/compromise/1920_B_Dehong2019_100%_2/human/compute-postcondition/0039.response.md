The value of `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`; and `ans2` are not modified by this snippet.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans1` is `ans1 - a[i] * 2`; `ans2` are not modified by this snippet.**
