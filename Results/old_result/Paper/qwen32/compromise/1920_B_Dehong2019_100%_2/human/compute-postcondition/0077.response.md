Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input with `x` greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x - 1`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`; `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `k` is greater than 0; `i + x` is less than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
