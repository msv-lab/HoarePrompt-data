The code snippet calculates the sum of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans2`, and the precondition that `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i`, `ans2` are not modified by this snippet; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a`.**
