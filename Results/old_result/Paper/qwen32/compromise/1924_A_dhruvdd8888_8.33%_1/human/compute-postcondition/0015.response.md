Functionality: **The function reads input values for `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s`. It then checks if there are at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets in the string `s`. If such sequences exist, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string based on the characters found and prints it.**
