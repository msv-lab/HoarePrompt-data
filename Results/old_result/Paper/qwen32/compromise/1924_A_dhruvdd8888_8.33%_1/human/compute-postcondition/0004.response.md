The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `ans`. This action does not affect the other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, or `win`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `ans` which is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; the string `s` is the new input string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list.**
