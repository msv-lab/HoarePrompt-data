You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. The string s is of length m and consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: - `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
    #- `n` is still an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26.
    #- `k` is still an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26.
    #- `m` is still an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
    #- `s` is the same input string.
    #- `us` is still a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
    #- `win` is an empty set.
    #- `ans` is a list containing the last characters of each sequence of `k` distinct characters from `us` found in `s`.
    #- `ps` is the count of such sequences of `k` distinct characters.
    #
    #Output State:
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. `n` is still an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. `k` is still an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26. `m` is still an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. `s` is the same input string. `us` is still a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list containing the last characters of each sequence of `k` distinct characters from `us` found in `s`. `ps` is the count of such sequences of `k` distinct characters. Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and always returns the string 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
