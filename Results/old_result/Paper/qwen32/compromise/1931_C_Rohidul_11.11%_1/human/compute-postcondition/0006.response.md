Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least two elements where `a[0] == a[1]`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 0; `end` is 0**

Natural Language: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so `l` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
