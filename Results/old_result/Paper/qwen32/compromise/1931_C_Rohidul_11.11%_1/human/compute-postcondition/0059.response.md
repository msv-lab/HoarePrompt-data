To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop continues to decrement `r` and increment `end` as long as `r > l` and the elements at `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` are identical.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute as long as the elements at the end of the list are identical. The loop stops when either `r` is no longer greater than `l` or the elements at `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` are not identical.

Let's break down what happens when the loop executes until completion:

1. `r` starts at `n - 1` and `end` starts at `0`.
2. The loop decrements `r` and increments `end` for each pair of identical elements at the end of the list.
3. The loop stops when `r` is no longer greater than `l` or the elements at `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` are not identical.

The final state will be when `r` is at the position where the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list ends, and `end` will be the count of these identical elements.

### Final Output State
- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it is just the length of the input list.
- `a` remains the same as the list itself does not change.
- `l` remains the same as it is determined by the sequence of identical elements starting from `a[0]`.
- `r` will be the index where the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list ends.
- `st` remains the same as it is determined by the sequence of identical elements starting from `a[0]`.
- `end` will be the count of consecutive identical elements at the end of the list.
- `ans` remains the same as it is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`.

### Natural Language Explanation
The loop continues to decrement `r` and increment `end` until it reaches a point where either the elements at `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` are not identical or `r` is no longer greater than `l`. At this point, `r` will point to the first element that is not part of the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list, and `end` will represent the count of these identical elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the list of integers read from the input; `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements starting from `a[0]` ends, or `n - 1` if all elements are identical; `r` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list ends; `st` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from `a[0]`; `end` is the count of consecutive identical elements at the end of the list; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`.**
