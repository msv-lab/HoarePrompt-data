Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers read from the input; `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the start of the list ends; `r` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list changes; `st` is the count of identical elements at the start of the list and `st` is 0; `end` is `k` and `end` is 0; `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`; `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**
