To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(0, ans))` statement, we need to analyze the values of the variables `ans`, `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` based on the provided initial state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (though `t` is not directly used in the calculation of `ans`).
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is the list of integers read from the input.
   - `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the start of the list ends.
   - `r` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list changes.
   - `st` is the count of identical elements at the start of the list.
   - `end` is `k` (this seems like a typo, and it's likely that `end` is related to the count of identical elements at the end of the list, but we'll assume `end` is correctly defined as the count of identical elements at the end of the list).
   - `ans` is calculated based on the following conditions:
     - If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
     - Otherwise, if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
     - Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.

2. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - **Case 1:** If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
     - `r` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list changes.
     - `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the start of the list ends.
     - The value of `ans` in this case is the difference between `r` and `l` minus 1.
   - **Case 2:** If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
     - `st` being 0 means there are no identical elements at the start of the list.
     - `end` being 0 means there are no identical elements at the end of the list.
     - The value of `ans` in this case is the length of the list minus 1.
   - **Case 3:** Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.
     - In all other cases, `ans` is simply the difference between `r` and `l`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The `print(max(0, ans))` statement ensures that the printed value is at least 0. If `ans` is negative, it will be printed as 0.

### Output Description:

The `print(max(0, ans))` statement will print the maximum of 0 and the calculated value of `ans` based on the conditions described above. The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific list `a` and the values of `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` derived from `a`.

Output: **max(0, ans) (where ans is calculated based on the conditions provided in the initial state)**
