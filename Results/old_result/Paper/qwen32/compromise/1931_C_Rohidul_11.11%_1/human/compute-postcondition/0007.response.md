The value of `st` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least two elements where `a[0] == a[1]`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0.
