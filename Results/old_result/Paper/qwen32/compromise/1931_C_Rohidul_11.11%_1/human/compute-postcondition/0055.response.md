Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the list of integers read from the input with `a[n - 1]` equal to `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 2]` equal to `a[n - 3]`; `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements starting from `a[0]` ends, or `n - 1` if all elements are identical; `r` is `n - 4`; `st` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from `a[0]`; `end` is 1; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`

The code snippet provided is:
```
end += 1
```

The value of `end` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the list of integers read from the input with `a[n - 1]` equal to `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 2]` equal to `a[n - 3]`; `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements starting from `a[0]` ends, or `n - 1` if all elements are identical; `r` is `n - 4`; `st` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from `a[0]`; `end` is 2; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`**
