To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the outputs after the first three iterations. The loop processes each test case independently, and the output for each test case is determined by the logic inside the loop.

Here's a summary of the loop's logic:
1. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`.
2. It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, at the start and end of the list, respectively.
3. It moves the `l` pointer to the right as long as the elements are consecutive duplicates and counts the number of such duplicates in `st`.
4. It moves the `r` pointer to the left as long as the elements are consecutive duplicates and counts the number of such duplicates in `end`.
5. It then determines the value of `ans` based on the values of `a[0]`, `a[-1]`, `l`, and `r`:
   - If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
   - If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, `ans` is `r - l`.
   - If `st` is 0, `end` is 0, and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
6. It prints the maximum of 0 and `ans`.

After all iterations, the output state will be a series of printed values, one for each test case, representing the calculated `ans` for that test case.

Given that the loop processes each test case independently, the output state after all iterations is simply the concatenation of the outputs for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are local to each iteration and do not persist across iterations.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the output of the loop for each test case.**

In natural language: The output state after all iterations is a sequence of integers, where each integer is the result of processing one test case according to the logic of the loop. Each result is printed on a new line.
