The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Given that `r` was initially `n - 3`, after the decrement, `r` becomes `n - 4`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal and at least one pair of consecutive elements are different; `l` is the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`; `r` is `n - 4`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list; `end` is 1**.
