Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal and at least one pair of consecutive elements are different; `l` is the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`; `r` is `n - 2`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list; `end` is 0.**

In the output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
