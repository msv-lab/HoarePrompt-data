Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal and at least one pair of consecutive elements are different; `l` is the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`; `r` is `l + 1`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first non-equal element is encountered. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, `ans` is 1. If `st` is 0, `end` is 0, and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**
