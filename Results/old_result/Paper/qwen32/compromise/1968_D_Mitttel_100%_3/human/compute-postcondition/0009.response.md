The code snippet `s = p[s]` updates the value of `s` to be the value at the index `s` in the list `p`.

Given the initial state, `s` is a list of 4 integers [t, n, P_B, P_S]. After the execution of the code `s = p[s]`, `s` will be updated to the value of `p` at the index specified by the current value of `s`.

Since `s` is a list of 4 integers, the code `s = p[s]` will not directly assign a list to `s`. Instead, it will use the fourth element of `s` (which is `P_S`) as the index to fetch the value from `p`.

Thus, `s` will be updated to `p[P_S - 1]` because `P_S` is 1-based and list indices in Python are 0-based.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is `p[P_S - 1]`, `k` is `k - 1`, `mx` is max(0, cur + k * a[s]), `cur` is `a[s]`, `vis` is a list of n zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is 1.**
