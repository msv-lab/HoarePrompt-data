The `while` loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `vis[s]` is `False` and `k` is greater than `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is `1` and at index `s` where it is `1`.
- `k` is `k - 1`.

Given this state, `vis[s]` is `1` (which is `True` in a boolean context), so the condition `not vis[s]` is `False`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again unless we adjust `vis[s]` to `0` or `k` to a value greater than `0` if it has already become `0`.

However, the problem specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `vis[s]` and `k`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `vis[s]` to `0` and ensure `k` is greater than `0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[p[S - 1]]` where `P_S - 1` is not equal to `P_B - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `mx` is `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is `1` and at index `s` where it is `0`.**
