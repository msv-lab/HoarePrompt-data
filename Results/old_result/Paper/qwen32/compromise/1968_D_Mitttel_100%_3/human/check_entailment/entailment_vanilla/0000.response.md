Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be 0-based by subtracting 1 from each element.
   - This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing, while the problem statement uses 1-based indexing.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position.
   - The function `func_1` takes the array `a`, the permutation `p`, the starting position `s`, and the number of turns `k`.

4. **Cycle Detection and Scoring:**
   - Inside `func_1`, the program uses a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - It iterates through the permutation, updating the current score `cur` and the maximum possible score `mx` for the remaining turns.
   - The maximum score is updated considering the score accumulated so far plus the score from staying in the current position for the remaining turns.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - It then compares these scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Index Adjustment:** The program incorrectly adjusts `a[i] -= 1`. The values in `a` are scores, and they should not be adjusted. The adjustment should only be done for the permutation `p`.
- **Cycle Handling:** The program does not handle cycles correctly. If a player enters a cycle, the program should calculate the maximum score within the cycle and outside the cycle separately, considering the number of full cycles that can be completed within `k` turns and the remaining turns.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program is not correct. It incorrectly adjusts the values in `a` and does not handle cycles properly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
