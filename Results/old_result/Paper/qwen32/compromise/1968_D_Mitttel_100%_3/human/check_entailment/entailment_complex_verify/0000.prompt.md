You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: `vis` is a list of n integers where positions corresponding to the visited indices are 1, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` values accumulated, `s` is the last visited position, and `k` is 0 if all turns were used or the remaining turns if a cycle was detected.
    return mx
    #The program returns mx, which is the maximum value of cur + k * a[s] encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered, where `cur` is the cumulative sum of values from list `a` based on the permutation in list `p`, starting from the position `s`, and `k` is the number of turns available.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Index Adjustment**: The code attempts to adjust the indices of the permutation and array by subtracting 1. However, it does this for the array `a` as well, which is incorrect because the values in `a` are not indices but scores. This adjustment should only be applied to the permutation array `p`.

2. **Score Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score in a cycle, but it does not consider the possibility of breaking out of a cycle early if a better score can be achieved by staying in place.

3. **Cycle Detection**: The function `func_1` correctly detects cycles, but it does not handle the case where `k` is very large and the player can stay in a cycle for multiple turns. The current implementation only considers the maximum score achievable in a single cycle, but the player might benefit from staying in place for some turns before entering a cycle.

4. **Initialization of `cur` and `mx`**: The variables `cur` and `mx` are initialized to 0. This is correct, but the logic for updating these variables should be more carefully considered, especially in the context of the cycle detection and the large value of `k`.

5. **Handling of Large `k`**: The function `func_1` does not handle the case where `k` is very large efficiently. It should be optimized to handle large `k` by considering the cycle lengths and the scores within those cycles.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    cycle = []
    cycle_scores = []
    cycle_length = 0
    total_score = 0
    current_score = 0
    
    # Detect the cycle and calculate scores
    while not vis[s]:
        vis[s] = 1
        cycle.append(s)
        cycle_scores.append(a[s])
        current_score += a[s]
        total_score += current_score
        cycle_length += 1
        s = p[s]
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            return total_score
    
    # If we are still in the cycle, calculate the score for the remaining turns
    if k > 0:
        remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
        total_score += (k // cycle_length) * total_score
        total_score += sum(cycle_scores[:remaining_turns])
    
    return total_score
```

This corrected version properly handles the cycle detection and calculates the score for the remaining turns after completing full cycles. It also avoids the incorrect index adjustment for the array `a`.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to these issues.
