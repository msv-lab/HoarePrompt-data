Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner of the game:

1. **Typo in the Output**: The program incorrectly outputs 'Sashah' instead of 'Sasha' when Sasha wins.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The program's logic for determining the winner does not correctly follow the rules of the game. Specifically, it does not account for the optimal moves by both players.
3. **Misuse of Leading Zeros**: The program attempts to count and subtract leading zeros, but this does not align with the game's rules. The critical factor is the total number of digits in the final number, not the count of leading zeros removed.
4. **Incorrect Handling of Leading Zeros**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a number, but this information is not used appropriately to determine the winner.
5. **Lack of Consideration for Anna's Optimal Moves**: The program does not simulate Anna's moves to reverse digits optimally.
6. **Lack of Consideration for Sasha's Optimal Moves**: The program does not simulate Sasha's moves to concatenate numbers optimally.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy strategy, to simulate the optimal moves by both players and determine the winner based on the final number of digits in the list.
