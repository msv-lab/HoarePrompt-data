In the given for loop, the loop iterates over the indices of the `num` list in reverse order. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the `len(num)` function. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `num` contains at least one element, as the loop will iterate from `len(num) - 1` to `0`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`num`**: The list `num` must contain at least one element, specifically the first integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. **`i`**: The variable `i` will be initialized to `len(num) - 1` before the loop starts. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` has a length of at least 1 so that `i` can be set to a valid index.

Since `num` represents a list where the first element is the number of test cases and the subsequent elements are related to those test cases, we need to ensure that `num` has at least one element to start with.

Given that `num` is expected to have at least one element, and considering the loop iterates in reverse, we need to ensure that `num` has at least one element to start the loop.

State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `counter` is 0**
