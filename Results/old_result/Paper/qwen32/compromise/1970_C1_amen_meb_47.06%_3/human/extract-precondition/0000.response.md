Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the initial node where the stone is placed. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.**
