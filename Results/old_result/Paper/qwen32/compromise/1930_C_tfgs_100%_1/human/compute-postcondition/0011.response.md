The code `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicates from the list `a` by converting it to a set (which inherently contains only unique elements) and then converting it back to a list. 

Given the initial state, `a` is a list where each element `a_i` is incremented by `i`. The variable `counter` was a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `a`. After the code execution, `a` will no longer contain any duplicate values, and `counter` will no longer be accurate as it was based on the original list `a` before duplicates were removed. The values of `n`, `i`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing unique integers derived from the original list where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, `a_3` is `a_3 + 3`, ..., `a_n` is `a_n + n` with duplicates removed, `i` is `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0.**
