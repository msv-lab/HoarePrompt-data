The code modifies the element at index `i` of the list `a` by adding `i + 1` to it. Given that `i` is initially 0, the element at index 0 (`a_1`) will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` integers where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, and `a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `i` is 0**.
