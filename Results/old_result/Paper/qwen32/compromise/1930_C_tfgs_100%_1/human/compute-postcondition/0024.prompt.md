Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing at least one unique integer derived from the original list where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, `a_3` is `a_3 + 3`, ..., `a_n` is `a_n + n` with duplicates removed, sorted in descending order, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` and greater than 0, `ans` contains a new element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` and greater than 0, `ans` contains a new element `a[i - 1] - 1`, `j` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` and greater than 0, `ans` contains elements including `a[i - 1] - 1` and `a[i - 1] - 2`, `j` is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
