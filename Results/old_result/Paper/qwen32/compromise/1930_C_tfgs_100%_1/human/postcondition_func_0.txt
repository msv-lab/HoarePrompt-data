The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It modifies each element of the list by adding its 1-based index to it. Then, it constructs a new list `ans` that includes all unique modified elements in descending order, along with additional elements calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.
