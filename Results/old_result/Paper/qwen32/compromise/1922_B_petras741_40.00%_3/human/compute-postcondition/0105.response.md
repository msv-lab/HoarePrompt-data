Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is a list containing all keys from `q` for which `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the number of keys in `q` that have a value greater than 0, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + 2 * q[eta[1]] + q[eta[2]]`, `res` is updated to its previous value plus `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
