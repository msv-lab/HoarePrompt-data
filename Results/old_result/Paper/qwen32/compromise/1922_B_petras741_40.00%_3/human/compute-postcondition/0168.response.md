Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `w` is the last list of `n` integers, `buffer` is an empty list, and all test cases have been processed.**

**Explanation:**
The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. After all `t` iterations, the loop variable `i` will have reached `t`, and `t` will be 0 if we consider the loop head condition `for i in range(t)`. The variable `n` will hold the value of `n` from the last test case, and `w` will be the list of integers from the last test case. The `buffer` remains an empty list throughout the loop as it is not modified within the loop body. All test cases have been processed, and the loop has terminated.
