Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is an empty list, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` (which is 0), `rho` is defined based on the conditions given, `res` is defined based on the conditions given, and `j` is 0.**
