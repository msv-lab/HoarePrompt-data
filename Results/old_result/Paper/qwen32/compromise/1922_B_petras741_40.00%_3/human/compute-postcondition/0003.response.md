The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer within the range 1 to 3 * 10^5, but the `input()` function will overwrite `n` with the new integer value provided by the user. The values of `t`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and the empty list `buffer` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, and a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= `n`, `buffer` is an empty list**.
