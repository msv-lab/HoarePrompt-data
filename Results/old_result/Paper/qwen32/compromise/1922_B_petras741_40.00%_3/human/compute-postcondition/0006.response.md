The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `q`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `buffer`, and `w`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is an empty dictionary.**
