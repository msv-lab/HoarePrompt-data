Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is a list containing the single element 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `eta` now contains the single element 0, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
