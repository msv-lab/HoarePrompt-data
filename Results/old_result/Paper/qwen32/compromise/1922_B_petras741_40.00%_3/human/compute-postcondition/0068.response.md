Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[0]` and `w[1]` is incremented by 1, `eta` is an empty list, `eta_ln` is 0, `rho` is not defined, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The value at key `w[1]` in the dictionary `q` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
