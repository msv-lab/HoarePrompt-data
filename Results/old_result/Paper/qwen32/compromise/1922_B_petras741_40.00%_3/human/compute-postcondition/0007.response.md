The code snippet assigns `q` a list containing `n + 1` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, `buffer`, and `w` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
