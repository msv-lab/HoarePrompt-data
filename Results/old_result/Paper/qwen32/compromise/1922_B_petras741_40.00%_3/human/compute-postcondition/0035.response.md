Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to n) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) * (q[eta[n]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.**

Natural Language: The value of `res` has been updated by adding `q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
