The given code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given the initial state, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive. The variable `j` is not explicitly defined in the snippet, but it is assumed to be an index variable that is valid within the bounds of the list `w`.

Since `w[j]` is an integer between 0 and `n`, the value at `q[w[j]]` will be incremented by 1. This means that the element at the position `w[j]` in the list `q` will change from 0 to 1 if it was 0 before, or it will be incremented by 1 if it was already a non-zero value.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1.**
