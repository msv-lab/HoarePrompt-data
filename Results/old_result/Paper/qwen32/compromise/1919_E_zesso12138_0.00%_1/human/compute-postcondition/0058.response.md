Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, with `dp[j]` being greater than 0, and all other elements of `dp` are initialized to 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`; `j` is 0 and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.**

In simple terms, the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` has been updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
