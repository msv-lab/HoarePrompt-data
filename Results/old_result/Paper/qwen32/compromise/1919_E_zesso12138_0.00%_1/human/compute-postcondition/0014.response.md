The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value of `data[index]`. This means `n` now holds the integer value found at the position specified by `index` in the `data` list. The other variables (`p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
