The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value of `data[index]`. Given that `index` is defined as `3 + 2 * n`, the new value of `n` will depend on the current value of `data[index]`.

Since the initial value of `n` was `int(data[index-1])`, and now it is being set to `int(data[index])`, the value of `n` changes. However, the values of `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2 * n`; `t` is 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
