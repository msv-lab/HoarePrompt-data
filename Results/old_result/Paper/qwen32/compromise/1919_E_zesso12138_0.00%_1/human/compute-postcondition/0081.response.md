Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the size of a hidden array `a`, and `p`, a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that the absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a non-zero value from `dp[final_sum]` where `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + n`.**
