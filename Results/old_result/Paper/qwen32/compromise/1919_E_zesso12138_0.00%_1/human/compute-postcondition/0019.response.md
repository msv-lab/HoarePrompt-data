The code appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2 * n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
