The code increments the value of `index` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

In natural language: The value of `index` is now `3 + n`. All other variables retain their previous values.
