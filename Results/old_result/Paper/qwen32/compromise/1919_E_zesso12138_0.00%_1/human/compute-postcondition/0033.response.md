To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and identify the relevant variables:

- `n`: The size of the last array `p` processed.
- `p`: The last array of integers derived from `data`.
- `data`: A list of strings.
- `index`: Calculated as `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`. Given `t` is 0, this simplifies to `1 + sum of sizes of all arrays p`.
- `t`: Set to 0.
- `results`: A list containing at least four elements, e.g., `[some_value1, some_value2, some_value3, some_value4]`.
- `result`: Holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
- `res`: The fourth element of `results`.

From the given information, `res` is explicitly described as the fourth element of the `results` list. Since the exact contents of the `results` list are not specified beyond it having at least four elements, we can denote the fourth element as `some_value4`.

Thus, the `print(res)` statement will output the fourth element of the `results` list.

Output: **some_value4 (where some_value4 is the fourth element of the results list)**
