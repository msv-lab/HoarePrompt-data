The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the string located at `data[index]`. Since `index` is 1, `n` is now the integer value of `data[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 1; `t` is a positive integer; `results` is an empty list**.
