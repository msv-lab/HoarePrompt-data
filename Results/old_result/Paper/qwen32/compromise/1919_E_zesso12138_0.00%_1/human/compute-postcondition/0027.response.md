To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the pattern established by the given output states after the first three iterations.

From the provided information:
- The loop runs `t` times.
- After each iteration, `index` is incremented by `1 + n` (where `n` is the size of the current array `p`).
- `results` accumulates the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

Let's break down the changes step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `index` starts at 1.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations.
   - `results` is initially an empty list.

2. **After the first iteration**:
   - `index` becomes `2 + n1` (where `n1` is the size of the first array `p`).
   - `results` contains one element.

3. **After the second iteration**:
   - `index` becomes `3 + n1 + n2` (where `n2` is the size of the second array `p`).
   - `results` contains two elements.

4. **After the third iteration**:
   - `index` becomes `4 + n1 + n2 + n3` (where `n3` is the size of the third array `p`).
   - `results` contains three elements.

Following this pattern, after `t` iterations, `index` will be:
\[ \text{index} = 1 + t + \sum_{i=1}^{t} n_i \]
where \( n_i \) is the size of the array `p` for the \( i \)-th iteration.

Since `t` iterations are completed, `t` will be 0 (as it decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0).

Thus, the final output state is:
- `n` will be the size of the last array `p` processed.
- `p` will be the last array of integers derived from `data`.
- `data` remains the same list of strings.
- `index` will be `1 + t + \sum_{i=1}^{t} n_i`.
- `t` will be 0.
- `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
- `result` will hold the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the size of the last array `p` processed; `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`; `t` is 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.**
