The function `func_1` calculates and returns a specific value from a dynamic programming array `dp` based on the size `n` of a hidden array `a` and a list `p` of its sorted prefix sums. The returned value is located at the index `final_sum`, which is determined by adding the last element of `p` to `n`.
