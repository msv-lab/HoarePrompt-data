### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic used to calculate the area of the square.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

2. **Logic to Determine Side Length**: 
    - The program checks if the x-coordinates of two pairs of points match. If they do, it calculates the side length as the absolute difference of the y-coordinates of those points.
    - The program handles three possible configurations of the square's sides:
        - `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4` means two sides are vertical and two are horizontal.
        - `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4` means the other possible vertical and horizontal configuration.
        - `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2` means the last possible configuration where the vertical and horizontal sides are swapped.
    - In each of these configurations, the program correctly calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference of the y-coordinates (or x-coordinates, depending on the configuration) of the appropriate points.

3. **Area Calculation**: Once the side length is determined, the program calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length (`res ** 2`) and prints it.

4. **Output**: The program prints the area for each of the `t` test cases.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program's correctness with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Points: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
   - Vertical sides: (1, 2) to (1, 5) and (4, 2) to (4, 5)
   - Horizontal sides: (1, 5) to (4, 5) and (1, 2) to (4, 2)
   - Side length: `abs(5 - 2) = 3`
   - Area: `3 ** 2 = 9`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Points: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
   - Vertical sides: (-1, 1) to (-1, -1) and (1, 1) to (1, -1)
   - Horizontal sides: (-1, -1) to (1, -1) and (-1, 1) to (1, 1)
   - Side length: `abs(1 - (-1)) = 2`
   - Area: `2 ** 2 = 4`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Points: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
   - Vertical sides: (45, 11) to (45, 39) and (17, 11) to (17, 39)
   - Horizontal sides: (45, 11) to (17, 11) and (45, 39) to (17, 39)
   - Side length: `abs(39 - 11) = 28`
   - Area: `28 ** 2 = 784`

The program's output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and verification, the program correctly calculates the area of the square for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
