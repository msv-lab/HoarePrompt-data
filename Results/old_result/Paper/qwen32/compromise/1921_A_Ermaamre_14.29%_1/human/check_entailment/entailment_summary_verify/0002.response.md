Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The task is to determine the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
- The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with four pairs of coordinates.
- The output should be the area of each square.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates. It then attempts to determine the side length of the square by checking specific pairs of x-coordinates and calculating the absolute difference in the y-coordinates. Finally, it squares the side length to get the area and prints it.

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.
- It calculates the side length by comparing x-coordinates and finding the appropriate y-coordinate differences.
- It prints the area of the square.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the coordinates for each test case.
   
2. **Logic to Determine Side Length:**
   - The program checks three possible scenarios where two x-coordinates are the same:
     - `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`
     - `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`
     - `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`
   - For each scenario, it calculates the side length by taking the absolute difference in the y-coordinates.
   - This logic is correct because if two x-coordinates are the same, the points form a vertical side of the square, and the difference in y-coordinates gives the side length.
   
3. **Calculation of Area:**
   - The program squares the side length to get the area and prints it.
   - This is correct as the area of a square is the side length squared.

4. **Handling Different Test Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases by iterating through the number of test cases specified by the input.
   - It processes each test case independently and prints the result for each.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should correctly handle squares of different sizes and positions on the coordinate plane, including squares with negative coordinates.
   - The problem guarantees that the input will always form a valid square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes, so the program does not need to handle invalid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the side length of the square and calculates the area based on the given coordinates. It handles multiple test cases and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the function summary.
