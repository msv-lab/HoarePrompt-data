Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `tleftZero` is increased by 2, while `leftOne` and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `leftZero` and `tleftZero` remain unchanged, while `leftOne` is increased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 2.**
