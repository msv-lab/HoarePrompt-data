The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `mid` is at least 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1, and `mid` must still be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1**
