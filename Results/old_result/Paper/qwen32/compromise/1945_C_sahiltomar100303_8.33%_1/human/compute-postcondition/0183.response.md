Postcondition: **`leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `mid` is less than `n`; `i` is `mid + 2`. If `s[i] == '0'`, then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are increased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1.**
