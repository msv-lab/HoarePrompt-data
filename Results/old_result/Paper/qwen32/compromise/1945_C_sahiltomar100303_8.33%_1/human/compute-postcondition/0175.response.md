Output State: **`leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` is less than `n`, `rightZero` is incremented by 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `trightOne` is incremented by 1, `i` is `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `rightOne` has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
