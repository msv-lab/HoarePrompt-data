Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `right` is equal to `n`.
2. `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`.
3. `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`.
4. `right` is `final_right`.
5. `left` is not 0.
6. Other variables remain unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```
print(right)
```

### Analysis:
From the initial state, we have two key pieces of information:
1. `right` is equal to `n`.
2. `right` is also equal to `final_right`.

This means that `n` and `final_right` are the same value. Therefore, the variable `right` holds the value of `n` (or `final_right`).

### Conclusion:
The `print(right)` statement will output the value of `right`, which is `n` (or `final_right`).

### Final Output:
Output: **n (where n is the value of right and final_right)**
