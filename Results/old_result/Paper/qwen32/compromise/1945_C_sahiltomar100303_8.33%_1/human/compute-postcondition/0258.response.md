Postcondition: **left is not 0, mid is 5, n is 10, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 5, rightOne is 1, right is not equal to 10. The absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right, or the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is greater than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right.**
