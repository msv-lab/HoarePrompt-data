Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `left` is explicitly set to 0.
- `tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`.
- `right` is set to `final_right`, and it is also explicitly stated that `right` is equal to `n`.
- `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`.

The `print(left)` statement will output the value of the variable `left`, which is explicitly given as 0.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **0**
