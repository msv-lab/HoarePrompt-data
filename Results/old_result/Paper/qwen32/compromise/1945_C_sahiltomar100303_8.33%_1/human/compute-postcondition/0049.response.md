Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `rightZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0'; otherwise, `rightOne` is 3 and `trightOne` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Since `rightZero` was initially 2, it is now 3. The value of `trightZero` is also incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', making it 3. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is incremented by 1, making it 3, and `trightOne` remains 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
