The code snippet increments the value of `right` by 1. Therefore, `right` which was initially 1, becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values depend on `right`, which they do not in this specific code snippet provided. 

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is a string, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1` and `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**
