The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right` was 5, so the new value of `right` is 6. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 4, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is less than 3, `right` is 6. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is 0. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is less than 2.**
