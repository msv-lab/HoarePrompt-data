The code snippet `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `mid`, `i`, and `leftZero`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `leftZero` is increased by 1, `tleftZero` is increased by 1.**
