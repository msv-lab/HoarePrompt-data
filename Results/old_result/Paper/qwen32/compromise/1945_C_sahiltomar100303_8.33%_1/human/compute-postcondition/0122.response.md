Postcondition: **`right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`, `right` is `final_right`, `left` is not 0, and other variables remain unchanged. If `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, the conditions stated above hold. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
