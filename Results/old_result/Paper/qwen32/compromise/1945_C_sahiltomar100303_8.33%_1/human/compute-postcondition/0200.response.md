The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Given that `rightOne` must be less than 3 before this operation, after the increment, `rightOne` will be less than or equal to 3. Since we do not have a specific initial value for `rightOne` other than it being less than 3, we can say that after the increment, `rightOne` will be a value between 1 and 3 inclusive.

The other variables (`left`, `mid`, `n`, `leftZero`, and `leftOne`) are not affected by this operation, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`left` is 4, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `leftZero` is 2, `rightOne` is between 1 and 3 inclusive, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`**.
