`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input between 1 and 2 * 10^4. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
