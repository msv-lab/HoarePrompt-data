The code decrements the value of `left` by 1. Initially, `left` is equal to `mid`, which is 5. After the decrement, `left` becomes 4. The values of `n`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and the string `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 4, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10. If the character at index `left - 1` (which is index 3) in the string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1 and `rightZero` is 3. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 2 and `rightOne` is 3.**
