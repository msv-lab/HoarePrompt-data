Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are 4, while `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain 0. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are 2, while `rightZero` and `trightOne` remain 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
