Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is -1, `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `trightZero` is `zero_count + 1` and `rightZero` is `zero_count + 1`. Otherwise, `trightZero` is `zero_count`, `trightOne` is 1, and `rightOne` is 1.**

Natural language: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
