Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the right half, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the right half, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the first half, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 2) // 2` and `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise `tleftOne` remains unchanged, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` remains unchanged, `trightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2) // 2`, `right` is `n // 2 + 1`.**

The value of `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
