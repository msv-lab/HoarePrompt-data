The code snippet provided increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `leftZero` is `count_zero`, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' otherwise `rightZero` is 0 plus 1, `leftOne` is `count_one`, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0' otherwise `rightOne` is 0, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is `s`, `tleftZero` is `count_zero + 1` if `s[i]` is '0' otherwise `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `trightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' otherwise `trightZero` is 0 plus 2, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0' otherwise `trightOne` is 0, `i` is `mid + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `trightZero` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
