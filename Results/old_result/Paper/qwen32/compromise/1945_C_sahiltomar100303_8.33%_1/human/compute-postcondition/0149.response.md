The provided code snippet increments the variable `tleftOne` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `mid`, `i`, `s`, and `leftOne`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the incremented value of `tleftOne` while keeping the other variables as they were initially described.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be at least 1, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` in `s` is not '0'; `leftOne` is incremented by 1; `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**
