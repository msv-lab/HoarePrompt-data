Postcondition: **`tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`, `right` is `final_right`, `left` is not 0, `right` is not equal to `n`, and `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left)` is greater than `abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`, with all other variables remaining unchanged.**
