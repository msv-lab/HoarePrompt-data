Postcondition: **`leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` is less than `n`. If `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `s[i]` is not '0' and `trightOne` is incremented by 1.**
