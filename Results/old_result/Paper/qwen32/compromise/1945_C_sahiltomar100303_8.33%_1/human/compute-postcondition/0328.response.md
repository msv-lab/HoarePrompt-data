The code snippet increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Therefore, the value of `rightZero` changes from `zero_count` to `zero_count + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `trightZero` is `zero_count + 1`, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is -2, `rightZero` is `zero_count + 1`, `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`, `rightOne` is 0**.
