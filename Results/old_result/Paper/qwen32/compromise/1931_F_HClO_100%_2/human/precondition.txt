t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each test case is a tuple (n, k, screenshots), where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and n * k <= 2 * 10^5. screenshots is a list of k lists, where each inner list contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the order of participants seen in each screenshot. The first element of each inner list corresponds to the participant who took the screenshot. All participants who take screenshots are unique across all test cases.
