The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Given that `val` initially contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`, after appending, `val` will contain two tuples: the original one and the newly appended one.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is the first integer from the new input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `val` includes the tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3))`**.
