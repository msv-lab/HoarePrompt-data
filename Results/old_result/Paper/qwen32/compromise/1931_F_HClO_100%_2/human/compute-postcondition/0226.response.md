The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. This operation affects the list `l2` by adding one element to it.

Given the initial state, `idx1` can be either `n-2` or `-1`. 

- If `idx1` is `n-2`, `a2` will be inserted at the position `n-2` in `l2`.
- If `idx1` is `-1`, `a2` will be appended to the end of `l2`.

Other variables (`i`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`. Additionally, the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
