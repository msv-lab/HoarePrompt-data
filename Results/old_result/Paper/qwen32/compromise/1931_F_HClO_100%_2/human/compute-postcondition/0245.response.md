Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `i` is `n-2`: This means `i` is set to the second-to-last index of a list or array of length `n`.
- `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`: This indicates that `idx1` could be the same as `i` or it could be `-1`.
- `idx2` is not `-1`: This means `idx2` holds a valid index other than `-1`.
- `p1` is `0` or `1`: This indicates that `p1` is a binary value.
- `p2` is `0` or `1`: Similarly, `p2` is also a binary value.
- `val` includes at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`: This means `val` is a collection (likely a list) that contains at least one tuple, where each tuple consists of two elements: `a3` and `l3`.
- The current value of `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed: This suggests that `l3` is a list that still contains at least one occurrence of `a3`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'no'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `l`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **no**
