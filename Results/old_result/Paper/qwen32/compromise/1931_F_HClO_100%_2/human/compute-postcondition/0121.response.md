To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case are `a3` and `l3`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (a3, l3) in val:
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `a1` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`.
- `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged.
- `idx2` is not -1.
- `p1` is 1.
- `p2` is 1.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `val` contains `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`.
- `l` is a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l1` is not modified and `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`. Additionally, if `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing `a3` from `l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since the loop iterates over the tuples in `val`, the state at the start of the next iteration will involve moving to the next tuple in `val`.

Let's denote the current tuple as `(a3_current, l3_current)`. After processing this tuple, the next tuple in `val` will be `(a3_next, l3_next)`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `a3` will be `a3_next`.
- `l3` will be `l3_next`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `l`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` contains `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`; `l` is a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`; `a3` is `a3_next`; `l3` is `l3_next`**.
