Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `a1` is the first integer from the input.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`.
- The loop has consumed `m - 2` additional lines of input.

### Code Snippet:

```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'no'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that depend on the values of `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, or `l22`. The string `'no'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

### Final Output:

Output: **no**
