Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` includes at least one more tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the next `a3_next`, `l3` is the next `l3_next` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged. We exit the most internal loop or if statement without modifying any of these variables.
