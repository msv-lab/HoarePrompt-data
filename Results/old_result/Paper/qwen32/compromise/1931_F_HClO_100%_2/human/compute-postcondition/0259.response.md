The given code snippet only contains an `input()` function call without assigning its result to any variable. This means that the input is taken but not stored or used further in the code. The loop completing all iterations and printing 'yes' is part of the initial state and is not affected by this `input()` call.

Since no variables are modified or new ones introduced by the `input()` call, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'; `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input.**
