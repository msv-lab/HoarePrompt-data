The code appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. This means that `val` now includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)` as one of its elements. The values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input; `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)`.**
