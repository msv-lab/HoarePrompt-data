Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 1 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 1 and `p2` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. The conditions and relationships between these variables remain as specified in the initial state.
