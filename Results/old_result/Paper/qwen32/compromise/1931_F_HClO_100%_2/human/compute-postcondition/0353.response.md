The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. Given the initial state, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and `idx2` can be either `-1` or `n - 2`.

Since `idx1` is not `-1` and `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` modifies `l2` by inserting `a2` at `idx1`, the length of `l2` increases by 1. The indices of elements in `l2` that are at positions `idx1` and above will shift by one position to the right.

Here's the updated output state:

- `idx1` remains the same.
- `idx2` remains the same (either `-1` or `n - 2`).
- `p1` remains unchanged.
- `p2` remains unchanged.
- `val` remains an empty list.
- `a3` remains the first integer from the input.
- `l3` remains the list of remaining integers from the input.
- The index of `a1` in `l3` remains greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.
- `l2` now contains `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.

Output State: **`idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx2` is `-1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` remains unchanged; `val` remains an empty list; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input; the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.**
