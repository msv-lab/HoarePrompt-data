The code snippet creates a new list `l22` by filtering out any occurrences of `a1` from the list `l2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`.**
