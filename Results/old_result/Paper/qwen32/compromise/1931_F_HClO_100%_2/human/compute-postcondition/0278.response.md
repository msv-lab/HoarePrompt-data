Output State: **`n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues without consuming any additional lines of input. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.`**

In simple terms: The variables `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` retain their initial values. The variables `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1. The variables `p1` and `p2` are both set to 0.
