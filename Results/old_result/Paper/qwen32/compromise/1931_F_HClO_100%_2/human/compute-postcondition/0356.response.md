The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input, the list `val` now contains this new tuple.

Output State: **`idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx2` is `-1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` remains unchanged; `val` is `[(a3, l3)]`; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at the position `idx2` and `l` is the same as `l1`. Otherwise, `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` and `l` is equal to `l2`.**
