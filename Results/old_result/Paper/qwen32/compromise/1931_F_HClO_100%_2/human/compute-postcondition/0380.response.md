The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state (`val`, `a3`, `l3`, `m`). Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not require any computation or reference to the provided variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state describes that `val` contains at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list, and `m` is at least 3.
2. **Code Execution**: The code snippet contains only one line: `print('no')`.
3. **Output Determination**: Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'no'`, this is what will be displayed regardless of the values of `val`, `a3`, `l3`, or `m`.

Thus, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **no**
