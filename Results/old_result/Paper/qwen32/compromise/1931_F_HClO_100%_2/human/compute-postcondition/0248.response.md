To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `a3` and `l3`. The loop iterates over the elements of the list `val`, where each element is a tuple `(a3, l3)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n-2`
- `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`
- `idx2` is not `-1`
- `p1` is `0` or `1`
- `p2` is `0` or `1`
- `val` includes at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`
- If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

Since the loop iterates over `val`, the state of `val` itself does not change during the loop execution. However, the current tuple `(a3, l3)` being processed will change to the next tuple in `val` at the start of the next iteration.

Let's denote the current tuple being processed as `(a3_current, l3_current)`. After processing this tuple, the next tuple `(a3_next, l3_next)` will be processed in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next tuple in `val`.

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` includes at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is `a3_next`, `l3` is `l3_next`**

Here, `a3_next` and `l3_next` represent the next tuple in the list `val` after `(a3_current, l3_current)`.
