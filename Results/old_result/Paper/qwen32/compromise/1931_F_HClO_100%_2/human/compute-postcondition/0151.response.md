Output State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0`.**

Explanation: The variables `p1` and `p2` are both assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
