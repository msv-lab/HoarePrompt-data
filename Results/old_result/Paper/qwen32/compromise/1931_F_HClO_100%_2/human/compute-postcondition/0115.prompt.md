Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise it can be 1 or greater than or equal to 2; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is an empty list if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise it is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l` is a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l1` is not modified and `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l1` is not modified and `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and the newly appended `(a3, l3)`; `l` is a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l1` is not modified and `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` contains the tuples `(a3, l3)` and the newly appended `(a3, l3)`; `l` is a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l1` is not modified and `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
