Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged. We exit the most internal loop or if statement without modifying any variables.
