The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This operation modifies the list `l1` by adding one element at the specified index, shifting all subsequent elements one position to the right.

Given the initial state, `l1` is a list of integers, and `a1` is an integer. After the insertion, `l1` will have one more element, and its length will increase by 1. All elements originally at positions `idx2` and above will be shifted to the right by one position.

No other variables are affected by this operation. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and `val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`**.
