The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the completion of the loop. Given that the initial state mentions the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes', and there are no changes made to `n` and `m` by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'; `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input.**
