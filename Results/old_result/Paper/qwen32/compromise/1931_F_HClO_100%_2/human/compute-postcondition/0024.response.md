The given Python code snippet initializes two variables `p1` and `p2` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0.**
