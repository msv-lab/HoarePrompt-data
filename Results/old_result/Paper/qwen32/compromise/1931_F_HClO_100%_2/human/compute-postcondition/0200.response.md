Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of with `idx1` and `idx2` both set to 2. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no changes occur.**
