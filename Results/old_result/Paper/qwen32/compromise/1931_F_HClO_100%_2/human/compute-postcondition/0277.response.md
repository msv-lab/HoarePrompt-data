The code snippet assigns the value `-1` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues without consuming any additional lines of input. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1`.**
