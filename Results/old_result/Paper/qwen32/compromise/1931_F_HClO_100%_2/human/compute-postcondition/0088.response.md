The given Python code snippet simply assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list of integers that `l1` contains. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `l` which now points to the same list as `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`.**
