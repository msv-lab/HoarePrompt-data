The value of `idx2` is updated to `n - 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was found, `val` is an empty list.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list.**
