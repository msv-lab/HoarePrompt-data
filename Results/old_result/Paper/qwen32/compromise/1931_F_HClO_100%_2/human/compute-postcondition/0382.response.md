Postcondition: **`val` contains at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list, and `m` is at least 3. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.**
