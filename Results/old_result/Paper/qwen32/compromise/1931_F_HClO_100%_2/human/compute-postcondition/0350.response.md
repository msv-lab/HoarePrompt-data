The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. Given the initial state, `idx2` can be either `-1` or `n - 2`. 

- If `idx2` is `-1`, `a1` is inserted at the end of the list `l1`.
- If `idx2` is `n - 2`, `a1` is inserted just before the last element of `l1`.

Since `l1` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we assume `l1` is the list that will be modified by this operation. The other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`) remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the operation, which they are not in this case.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx2` is `-1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` remains unchanged; `val` remains an empty list; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l1` has `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`.**
