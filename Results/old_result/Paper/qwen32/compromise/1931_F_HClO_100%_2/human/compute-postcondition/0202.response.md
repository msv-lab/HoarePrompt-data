The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `val`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables (`i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`). 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `-1`, `idx2` is `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was found, `val` is an empty list.**
