The provided initial state does not give any specific details about the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, or `n`. It only mentions that `m` is equal to 2 and describes certain conditions under which `idx1` and `idx2` might be set or modified. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('yes')`.

This means that regardless of the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, or `n`, the output of the `print` statement will always be the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:

Output: **yes**
