In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head contains the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The variables `n` and `k` are defined inside the loop body and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `n` and `k` are not relevant to the loop's execution condition.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
