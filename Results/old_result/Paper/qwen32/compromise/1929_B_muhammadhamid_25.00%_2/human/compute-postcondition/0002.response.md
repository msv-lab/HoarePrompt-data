Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the size of the square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
