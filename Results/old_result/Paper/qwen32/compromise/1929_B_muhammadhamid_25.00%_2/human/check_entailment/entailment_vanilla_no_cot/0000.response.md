Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Case when `k == 1`**: The program correctly prints `1` because only one cell is needed to color one diagonal.

2. **Case when `k <= 2 * n`**: The program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This logic is incorrect. The number of diagonals that can be colored with the minimum number of cells is more complex than simply dividing `k` by `2` and taking the ceiling.

3. **Case when `k > 2 * n`**: The program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This logic is also incorrect for similar reasons as the previous case.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider how diagonals can be optimally covered with colored cells. The key insight is that the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by coloring cells along the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal is `2 * n - 1`. Beyond this, additional cells need to be placed optimally.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k <= n:
            print(k)
        elif k <= 2 * n - 1:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(k - n + 1)

func()
```

Explanation:
- If `k <= n`, we can color `k` cells along the main diagonal.
- If `k <= 2 * n - 1`, we can color `n` cells along both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.
- If `k > 2 * n - 1`, we need to color additional cells beyond the main and anti-diagonals. The formula `k - n + 1` accounts for this.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
