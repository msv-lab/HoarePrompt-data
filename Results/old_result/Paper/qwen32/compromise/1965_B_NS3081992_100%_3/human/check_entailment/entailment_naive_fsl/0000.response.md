Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code aims to solve the problem of finding a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, but for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Handling of `k = 1`**:
   - When `k = 1`, the code handles the special case where `n = 2` separately.
   - For `n > 2`, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - This seems correct for `k = 1` as it ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, but all other sums are achievable.

2. **Handling of `k > 1`**:
   - The code constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - While this approach tries to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`, it does not guarantee that all sums `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k` can be achieved.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Subsequence Sum Property**:
   - The code does not explicitly ensure that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
   - For example, consider the case `n = 10` and `k = 7`. The sequence generated might not cover all sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where `k` is close to `n` or when `n` is a power of 2.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 9`, the sequence might not cover all sums from 1 to 8.

3. **General Construction**:
   - The construction of the sequence is based on powers of 2 and specific values, but it does not guarantee that all required sums can be achieved.
   - There might be gaps in the sums that can be achieved with the constructed sequence.

### Example of Failure:

Let's consider the input `n = 10` and `k = 7`:
- The code might generate a sequence like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16]`.
- However, it is not guaranteed that all sums from 1 to 10 except 7 can be achieved with this sequence.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the code does not guarantee that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`. Therefore, the code is incorrect for at least some cases.

Correctness: **False**.
