Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and their specific values are determined by the return values of `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string. `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 1.**
