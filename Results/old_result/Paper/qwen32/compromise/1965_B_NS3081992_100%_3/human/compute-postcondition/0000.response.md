In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use. The number of iterations of the loop is determined by the return value of `func_10()`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

Since we cannot adjust the implementation of `func_10()` or its return value directly, we can only make assumptions about its return value for the purpose of this task. Thus, the state we need to adjust is the assumption that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
