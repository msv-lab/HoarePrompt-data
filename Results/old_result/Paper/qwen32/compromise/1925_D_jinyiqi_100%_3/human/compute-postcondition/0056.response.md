The given code snippet updates the value of `p` based on the formula provided. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the calculation for `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the first input integer
- `m` is the second input integer
- `k` is the third input integer
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are the values read during the last iteration
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`
- `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`

The code snippet updates `p` to:
```python
p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
```

Since `gcd` is recalculated based on the new value of `p` and `q`, and `q` remains unchanged, the new `gcd` will be calculated after this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the values read during the last iteration, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the new `p` and `q`.**
