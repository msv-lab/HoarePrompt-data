The code snippet `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Given that `sum_f` was initially set to `f`, after executing this line, `sum_f` will effectively be `f + f`, which is `2 * f`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains the first input integer.
- `m` remains the second input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `k` remains the third input integer.
- `sum_f` is now `2 * f`.
- `a` remains the first of the new input integers.
- `b` remains the second of the new input integers.
- `f` remains the third of the new input integers.
- `j` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is 2 * f, `a` is the first of the new input integers, `b` is the second of the new input integers, `f` is the third of the new input integers, `j` is 1.**
