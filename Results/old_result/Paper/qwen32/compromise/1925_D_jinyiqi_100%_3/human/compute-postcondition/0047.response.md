The given code snippet increments the variable `sum_f` by the value of `f`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `sum_f` changes, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the newly read values from the input, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**
