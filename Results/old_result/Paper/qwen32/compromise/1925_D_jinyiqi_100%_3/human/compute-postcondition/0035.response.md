The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `cn2` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This means the value of `cn2` will be updated based on the current value of `n`.

Given the initial state, `cn2` was already defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. Since the code reassigns `cn2` with the same formula, the value of `cn2` remains unchanged unless `n` has been modified elsewhere in the code which is not shown here. However, based on the given snippet alone, `cn2` retains its previously calculated value.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same for all other variables, and only the confirmation of `cn2` being recalculated (though it doesn't change its value) is noted.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the total sum of all `f` values read from the input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of values read from the input, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) / gcd`, `q` is `(2 * cn2) / gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
