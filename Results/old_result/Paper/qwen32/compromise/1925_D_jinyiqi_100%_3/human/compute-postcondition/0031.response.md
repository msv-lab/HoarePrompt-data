The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2.

All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `2 * f`, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the three integers read from the input, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `j` is 2**
