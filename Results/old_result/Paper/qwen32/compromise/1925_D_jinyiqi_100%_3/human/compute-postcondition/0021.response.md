To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the problem step-by-step using the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `k` is the third input integer.
- `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations.
- `cn2` is calculated as \( n \times (n - 1) // 2 \).
- `p` is calculated as \( \frac{2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{gcd} \).
- `q` is calculated as \( \frac{2 \times cn2}{gcd} \).
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding the Formula**:
   - `pow(q, -1, M)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`. This means it finds a number `x` such that \( q \times x \equiv 1 \pmod{M} \).
   - `p * pow(q, -1, M)` effectively computes \( \frac{p}{q} \mod M \).
   - Finally, `% M` ensures that the result is within the range of \(0\) to \(M-1\).

2. **Variables**:
   - `p` and `q` are derived from the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f`.
   - `gcd` ensures that `p` and `q` are simplified fractions.

3. **Output**:
   - The expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` calculates the integer result of the division of `p` by `q` modulo `M`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity of the calculations and the fact that the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, and `M` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **The integer result of \( \left(\frac{p}{q}\right) \mod M \) where \( p = \frac{2 \times k \times n \times (n - 1) // 2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{gcd} \) and \( q = \frac{2 \times n \times (n - 1) // 2}{gcd} \), and \( gcd \) is the greatest common divisor of \( p \) and \( q \).**
