To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. The loop iterates `m` times, and during each iteration, it reads three integers (`a`, `b`, `f`) from the input and updates `sum_f` by adding `f` to it. The variables `p` and `q` are recalculated based on the updated `sum_f`.

Here's a breakdown of the final state after `m` iterations:

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `i`: Remains unchanged as it is initialized to 1 and never modified within the loop.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is the first input integer.
- `m`: Remains unchanged as it is the second input integer and determines the number of iterations.
- `k`: Remains unchanged as it is the third input integer.
- `sum_f`: After `m` iterations, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read from the input during these iterations.
- `cn2`: Remains unchanged as it is calculated once at the beginning as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `a`, `b`, `f`: These are the last set of values read from the input during the final iteration.
- `p` and `q`: These are recalculated using the final value of `sum_f` after all iterations.

Let's denote the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations as `total_sum_f`. Then the final values of `p` and `q` can be expressed as:
- `p` = `(2 * k * cn2 * total_sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) / gcd`
- `q` = `(2 * cn2) / gcd`
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

Thus, the final output state after all the iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the total sum of all `f` values read from the input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of values read from the input, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) / gcd`, `q` is `(2 * cn2) / gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `sum_f` holds the total sum of all `f` values read, and `p` and `q` are recalculated using this total sum. All other variables remain unchanged or hold their last read values.
