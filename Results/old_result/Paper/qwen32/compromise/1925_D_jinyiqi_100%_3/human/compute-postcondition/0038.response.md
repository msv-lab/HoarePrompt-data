The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns this value to the variable `gcd`. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `p`, `q`) are modified by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the total sum of all `f` values read from the input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of values read from the input, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
