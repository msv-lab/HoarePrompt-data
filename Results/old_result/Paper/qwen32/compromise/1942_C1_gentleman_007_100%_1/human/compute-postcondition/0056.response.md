Functionality: **The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, and uses the `graph` dictionary to represent the graph where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices. It also uses the `vis` list or dictionary to keep track of visited vertices, where `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise. The function performs a traversal starting from the vertex `ver` and marks the vertices as visited. There are no specified return values in the description, so it is assumed that the function modifies the `vis` list or dictionary in place to reflect the visited vertices.**
