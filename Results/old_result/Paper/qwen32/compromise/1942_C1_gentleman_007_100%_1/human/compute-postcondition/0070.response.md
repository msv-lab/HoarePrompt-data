Postcondition: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. If `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is now `i - 1` and must be non-zero. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are both decremented by 1 and must be non-zero, and `l` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it.**
