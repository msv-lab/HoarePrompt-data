The code sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, marking `node` as visited. This does not affect the values of `ver`, `graph[ver]`, or `q` as they were described in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` contains at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`, `q` now includes `node` as its new rightmost element, and `vis[node]` is 1.**
