To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does:

1. The loop iterates over each neighbor (`node`) of the current vertex (`ver`) in the graph.
2. If a neighbor (`node`) has not been visited (`vis[node]` is `0`), it is added to the queue (`q`), and marked as visited (`vis[node]` is set to `1`).

The loop will continue until all neighbors of `ver` have been processed.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `ver` has at least 3 neighbors, and the first 3 of them were not visited before the loop started.

Letâ€™s assume `ver` has `n` neighbors in total. The loop will execute `n` times, adding each unvisited neighbor to `q` and marking them as visited.

**Final Output State:**
- All neighbors of `ver` will have been processed.
- Each unvisited neighbor of `ver` will have been added to `q`.
- Each unvisited neighbor of `ver` will have been marked as visited in `vis`.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, all the neighbors of the vertex `ver` that were not previously visited will have been added to the queue `q`, and their corresponding entries in `vis` will have been set to `1`.

Output State: **All unvisited neighbors of `ver` have been added to `q`, and their corresponding entries in `vis` have been set to `1`.**
