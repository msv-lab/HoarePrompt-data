You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary or adjacency list representing the graph where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, vis is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices where vis[node] is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: All vertices in the connected component of the initial vertex `ver` have been visited, printed, and marked as visited in `vis`. The queue `q` is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, and uses the `graph` dictionary to represent the graph where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices. It also uses the `vis` list or dictionary to keep track of visited vertices, where `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise. The function performs a traversal starting from the vertex `ver` and marks the vertices as visited. There are no specified return values in the description, so it is assumed that the function modifies the `vis` list or dictionary in place to reflect the visited vertices.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
