Output State: **All vertices in the connected component of the initial vertex `ver` have been visited, printed, and marked as visited in `vis`. The queue `q` is empty.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, all the vertices that are reachable from the initial vertex `ver` have been visited, printed, and their corresponding entries in `vis` have been set to `1`. The queue `q` is empty because there are no more vertices to process.
