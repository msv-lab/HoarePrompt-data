Postcondition: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. The value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is either `len(b)` or `len(b) - 1` and `j` must be greater than 0, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`. `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `j` remains `len(b)` and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `j` is `len(b) - 1` and `l` contains `a[i]`.**
