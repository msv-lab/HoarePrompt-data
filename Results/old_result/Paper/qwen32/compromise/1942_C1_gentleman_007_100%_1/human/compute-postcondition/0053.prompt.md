Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` holds the value of the leftmost element that was removed from `q`; all neighbors of all nodes that were removed from `q` have been visited; each visited node is marked as `1` in `vis`; `q` must contain at least one unvisited node unless it was initially of size 1 and that node was just removed.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is a node that has at least one neighbor in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least one neighbor. If `vis[node]` is `1`, then `q` now contains `node` as its last element. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged and `q` is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ver` is a node that has at least two neighbors in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least two neighbors, and `node` is the next neighbor in the list after the last one processed. If `vis[node]` was 0, then `q` now includes `node` at the end of its list and `vis[node]` is 1. Otherwise, there is no change to `q` and `vis[node]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ver` is a node that has at least two neighbors in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least two neighbors, and `node` is the next neighbor in the list `graph[ver]` after the last one processed. If `vis[node]` was initially 0, then `q` has `node` appended to it and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q` or `vis[node]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
