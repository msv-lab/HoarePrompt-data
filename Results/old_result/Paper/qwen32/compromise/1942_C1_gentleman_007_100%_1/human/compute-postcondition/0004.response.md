Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `graph` is a dictionary or adjacency list representing the graph, `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` has had its front element removed, and `vis[ver]` is 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `ver` now holds the value of the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`. The deque `q` has had its front element removed. The other variables, `graph` and `vis`, remain unchanged. The vertex `ver` is still marked as visited in the `vis` list or dictionary.
