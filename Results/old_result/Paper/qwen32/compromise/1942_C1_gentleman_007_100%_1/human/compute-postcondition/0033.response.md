The code appends the `node` to the queue `q`. Therefore, `q` now contains the `node` as its new rightmost element. The values of `ver`, `graph[ver]`, and `node` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` contains at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`, and `q` now includes `node` as its new rightmost element.**
