Output State: **All neighbors of all nodes that were removed from `q` have been visited. Each visited node is marked as `1` in `vis`, and all unvisited neighbors of these nodes have been added to `q`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, every node that is reachable from the initial `ver` has been visited, marked as visited in the `vis` dictionary, and all of their unvisited neighbors have been added to the queue `q`. The loop stops when there are no more unvisited neighbors to process.
