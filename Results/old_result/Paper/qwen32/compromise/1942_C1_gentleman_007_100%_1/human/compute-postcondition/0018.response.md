Postcondition: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors; `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed. If `vis[node]` was initially False, then `q` has `node` appended to it and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q` or `vis[node]`.**
