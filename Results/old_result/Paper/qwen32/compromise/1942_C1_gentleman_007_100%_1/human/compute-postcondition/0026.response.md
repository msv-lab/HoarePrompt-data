Output State: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor, `vis[node]` is `1`, and `node` has been appended to `q`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `vis[node]` has been changed to `1`. All other conditions and states remain the same.
