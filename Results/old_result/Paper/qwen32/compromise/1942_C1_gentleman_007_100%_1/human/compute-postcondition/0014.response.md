Postcondition: **`ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors; `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` after the previously processed node. If `vis[node]` was 0, then `node` is appended to `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q`.**
