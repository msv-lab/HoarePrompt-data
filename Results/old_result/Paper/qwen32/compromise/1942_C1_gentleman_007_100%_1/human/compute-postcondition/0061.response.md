The code appends the element `a[i]` to the list `l`. Therefore, `l` now contains the element `a[i]` at the end of the list. The values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and the condition that `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. The value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is `len(b) - 1` and `j` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list containing `a[i]`. `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.**
