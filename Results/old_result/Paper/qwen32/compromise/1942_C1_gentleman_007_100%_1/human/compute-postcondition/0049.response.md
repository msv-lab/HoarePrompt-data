The only objects in the loop head are the variable `node` and the list `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `graph[ver]`. If there are more neighbors in `graph[ver]` to process, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `node` is the next neighbor in the list after the last one processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `node` should be the next neighbor in the list `graph[ver]`.

Given that `graph[ver]` contains at least two neighbors and `node` is the next neighbor in the list after the last one processed, we need to adjust `node` to be the next neighbor in the list.

State: **`ver` is a node that has at least two neighbors in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least two neighbors, and `node` is the next neighbor in the list `graph[ver]` after the last one processed.**
