The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, constrained by 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. `m` represents the number of vertices that can be used to form diagonals, constrained by 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5). The function returns a 2D list `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1) where `l[x][y]` is set to 1 for `m` pairs of vertices (x, y) returned by `func_1()`.
