The function accepts a positive integer `n` and an integer `mod` (which can be -1 or any other integer). It returns a list `dearr` where the elements are calculated based on specific arithmetic rules. If `mod` is -1, the list is `[1, 0, 1, 2, 9, 44]`. Otherwise, the list starts with `[1, 0]` and each subsequent element is computed using the formula involving modulo operations with `mod`.
