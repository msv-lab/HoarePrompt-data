Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is 1; the tree is represented by n-1 edges and has exactly two leaves; the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round; `x` is the value of `y`; `y` is the last adjacent node of `x` in the tree structure, which was the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes representing the entire tree structure excluding the node assigned to `y` for the key `x` and `lst[x]` has one less element than before; `s` is True; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
