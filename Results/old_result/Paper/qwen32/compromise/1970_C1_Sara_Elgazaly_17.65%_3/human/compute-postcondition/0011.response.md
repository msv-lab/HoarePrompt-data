The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This does not affect the existing variables `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, or `lst` directly. However, it does introduce new values for `a` and `b` which are not specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 3, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` containing `b` and `lst[b]` containing `a` and now `lst[b]` includes `a` as an additional element, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input`.**
