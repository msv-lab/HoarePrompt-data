The code snippet `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. This means that after the execution of this line, `x` will hold the same value as `y`. The other variables (`lst[x]`, `s`, `lst[y]`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values unless explicitly modified by other lines of code not provided here.

Output State: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, `s` is True, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list if the if condition is met. If `lst[y]` is an empty list, the else part does not execute, and the state remains as described except for the condition on `lst[y]`.**
