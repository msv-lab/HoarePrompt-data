The code snippet provided only assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `s`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes representing the entire tree structure, `s` is True.**
