The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. However, the loop runs `x - 1` times, so the loop counter is implicitly managed by the range function.

Given the loop statement `for _ in range(x - 1):`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop counter, which is controlled by the range function. Since the loop runs `x - 1` times, we need to adjust `x` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is such that the loop has already executed once (since `t` is 1, and we are adjusting for the next iteration). Therefore, to execute one more time, `x` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 3, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` containing `b` and `lst[b]` containing `a`.**
