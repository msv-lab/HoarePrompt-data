The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `lst`. This means that the value of `y` will be updated to the last adjacent node of `x` that was stored in `lst[x]`, and the list `lst[x]` will have one less element after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is 1; the tree is represented by n-1 edges and has exactly two leaves; the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round; `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2 and x is not a leaf; `y` is the last adjacent node of `x` in the tree structure that was removed from `lst[x]`; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes representing the entire tree structure excluding the node assigned to `y` for the key `x` and `lst[x]` now has one less element; `s` is True.**
