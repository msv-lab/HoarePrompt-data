Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program. The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the number of cubes), but it does not consider whether the difference `n - m` is even. This is crucial because each move either adds or removes one cube, so to end up with exactly `m` cubes, the total number of additions must balance the total number of removals, which requires `n - m` to be even.

For example, in the case where `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the program will output "Yes" because `n >= m`. However, it is impossible to end up with exactly 1 cube after 2 moves, as the only possible outcomes are 0 or 2 cubes. The correct output should be "No".

The function summary provided supports the original assessment by noting that the function only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and does not account for the parity of `n - m`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
