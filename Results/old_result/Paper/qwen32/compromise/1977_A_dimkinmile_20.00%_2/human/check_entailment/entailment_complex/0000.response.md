### Reasoning:

The provided code contains a logical flaw that makes it incorrect based on the problem description. The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes) and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". However, this is not the correct logic to solve the problem.

To determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider both adding and removing cubes. Specifically, the number of cubes `m` must be reachable from 0 by adding and removing cubes in exactly `n` moves. This means that `m` must be within the range `[0, n]` and the difference between `n` and `m` must be even. The reason for the even difference is that each pair of an addition and a removal brings the number of cubes back to the same parity (odd to odd, or even to even).

For example:
- If `n = 3` and `m = 3`, it is possible to add 3 cubes to get exactly 3 cubes.
- If `n = 2` and `m = 4`, it is impossible because the difference is 2 (even), but we cannot reach 4 cubes with only 2 moves.
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it is possible to add 3 cubes and remove 2 cubes, or add 5 cubes and remove 2 cubes, etc.

The current implementation does not correctly account for these conditions.
