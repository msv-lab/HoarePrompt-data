You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads pairs of integers `n` and `m` for multiple test cases, and for each pair, it prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, otherwise it prints 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes). However, it does not consider the possibility that the number of moves `n` could be odd, which would allow Nikita to end up with an odd number of cubes, or even, which would allow an even number of cubes.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2` and `m = 1`. The program would output "No" because `n` is not greater than or equal to `m`, but in reality, Nikita can perform one move to add a cube and then one move to remove it, leaving him with 1 cube. Thus, the correct output should be "Yes".

Another example is `n = 3` and `m = 0`. The program would output "No" because `n` is not less than `m`, but Nikita can perform three moves to add three cubes and then remove all three, resulting in 0 cubes. Thus, the correct output should be "Yes".

The correct logic should be that if `n` is at least `m` and `n - m` is even, then it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) can be used to adjust the number of cubes by 2, and if `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to reach exactly `m` cubes.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
