### Reasoning:

The provided Python program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling the `func_1` function. Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

The logic of the program is to check if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The current implementation checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No".

However, this logic is incorrect. The condition `n >= m` does not accurately determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. 

Here's why:
- **Adding and Removing Cubes**: Nikita can add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes can range from `max(0, n - m)` to `n + m` (if starting from zero cubes).
- **Parity Check**: To determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check if `n - m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) keeps the parity of the number of cubes the same. If `n - m` is even, it's possible to reach `m` cubes; otherwise, it's not.

### Correct Logic:
- The correct condition should check if `n - m` is even, which can be done using the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

### Revised `func_1`:
```python
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
