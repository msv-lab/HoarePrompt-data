Reasoning:  
The provided program reads multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower). If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No', indicating that it is not possible.

This logic is correct based on the problem description. For Nikita to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, he needs to be able to add enough cubes to reach `m` without going below zero cubes at any point. Since he can add or remove exactly one cube per move, he can achieve any number of cubes from 0 up to `n` (inclusive) after `n` moves. Therefore, if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is possible to have `m` cubes, and the program correctly outputs 'Yes'. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, and the program correctly outputs 'No'.

Correctness: **True**
