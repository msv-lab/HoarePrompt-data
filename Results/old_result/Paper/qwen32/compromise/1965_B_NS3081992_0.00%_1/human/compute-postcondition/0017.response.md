The code snippet `ans.append(k + 1)` appends the value of `k + 1` to the end of the list `ans`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.

After the code execution, `ans` will have an additional element `k + 1` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, and then `k + 1`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.**
