### Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic for Determining Stair, Peak, or Neither:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR".
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is satisfied, it outputs "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the appropriate result ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case.

The execution summary aligns with the program's behavior as described. The program correctly interprets the conditions for a "STAIR", a "PEAK", and outputs "NONE" when neither condition is met.

### Correctness:
Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
