### Reasoning:
The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The logic correctly checks for the conditions specified in the problem statement:
- A "STAIR" is defined as `a < b < c`.
- A "PEAK" is defined as `a < b > c`.

The program uses a loop to handle multiple test cases, and it processes each test case independently, printing the correct result for each one.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
