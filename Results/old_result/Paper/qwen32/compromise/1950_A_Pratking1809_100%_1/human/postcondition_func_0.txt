The function reads an integer `q` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9). It then prints 'STAIR' if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, prints 'PEAK' if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, and prints 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
