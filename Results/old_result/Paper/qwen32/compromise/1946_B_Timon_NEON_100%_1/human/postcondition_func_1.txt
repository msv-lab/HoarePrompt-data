The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a segment (a sublist) of the list that has the maximum sum. The segment is represented as a list containing the sum of the segment and the starting and ending indices of the segment in the original list. If all elements are negative, it returns a segment with a sum of -1 and the last index of the list.
