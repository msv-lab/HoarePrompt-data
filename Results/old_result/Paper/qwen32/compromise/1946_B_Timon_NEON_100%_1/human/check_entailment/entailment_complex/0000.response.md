### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

2. **Approach:**
   - The strategy is to identify the most beneficial subarray to repeatedly sum and insert. This is because summing a positive subarray and inserting it multiple times will maximize the overall sum.
   - The function `func_2` is designed to find the subarray with the maximum sum in the given array. This is a classic "maximum subarray sum" problem, which can be solved using Kadane's algorithm.
   - If all elements are negative, `func_2` should return a segment with a sum of -1, but the logic in `func_2` seems to handle this correctly by returning a segment with a sum of -1 and the last index of the list.
   - The main logic then computes the final maximum sum using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`. This formula effectively calculates the sum of the array after `k` operations by leveraging the maximum subarray sum.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Reviewing the Code:**
   - `func_1` correctly computes the modulo operation.
   - `func_2` correctly identifies the maximum subarray sum and handles edge cases where all elements are negative.
   - `func_3` is not used in the provided code, so it can be ignored for this problem.

4. **Verification:**
   - The code provided seems to correctly implement the logic described above.
   - The formula for computing the final maximum sum is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
   - The modulo operation ensures the output is within the required range.
