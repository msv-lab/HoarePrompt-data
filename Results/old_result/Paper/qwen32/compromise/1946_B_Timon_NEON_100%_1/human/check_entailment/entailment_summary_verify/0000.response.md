### Reasoning:

The provided code does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues systematically:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the modulo operation, which is necessary for the final result to be within the required bounds (i.e., modulo \(10^9 + 7\)). This part of the code is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray (similar to Kadane's algorithm). However, there are a few issues:
     - The function does not return the correct data structure or values needed for the subsequent operations. It is supposed to return the maximum sum subarray and its indices, but it does not handle all edge cases properly.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where all elements are negative, which can lead to incorrect results.
     - The logic for maintaining and updating the maximum segment is not entirely correct, and it appends segments in a way that might not be optimal for the subsequent operations.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is not even started and is supposed to handle the core logic of performing the operations and calculating the maximum possible sum. The function summary provided does not match the intended functionality of `func_3`. The summary describes a function that returns a sublist of the first `quantity` elements, which is not what `func_3` should do. Instead, `func_3` should be responsible for performing the operations and calculating the maximum sum.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The problem requires performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array to maximize the total sum.
   - The given code does not implement the logic to perform these operations. It only partially attempts to find the maximum sum subarray, which is just one step in the process.
   - To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
     - Find the maximum sum subarray.
     - Use this subarray to perform the operations in a way that maximizes the total sum.
     - Perform exactly `k` operations.
     - Return the maximum sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Final Evaluation:

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not fully implement the required logic to solve the problem, and the third function is not even started. The current implementation does not handle the requirement of performing exactly `k` operations and does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum after these operations.

**Final: False**
