### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`:** 
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This matches the requirement to output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is designed to find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum in the given array `arr`.
   - It uses a variation of Kadane's algorithm to keep track of the maximum sum subarray.
   - The function returns a list containing the maximum sum and the indices of the subarray.
   - If all elements are negative, it returns a segment with a sum of -1 and the last index of the list.
   - This is a key part of the solution because the maximum possible sum of the array can be significantly increased by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is negative, it sets it to 0 (since adding a negative sum would decrease the total).
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
     - `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k` represents the sum of the maximum subarray added `k` times.
     - `sum(a)` is the sum of the original array.
     - Subtracting `max_segment[0]` once accounts for the fact that the maximum subarray is already included in the original sum.
   - The result is then passed to `func_1` to take the modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is not used in the provided main program logic and does not seem relevant to solving the problem as described.
   - It appears to be a placeholder or leftover code that does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, taking into account the constraints and requirements of the problem. The unused function `func_3` does not impact the correctness of the solution.

**Correctness: True**
