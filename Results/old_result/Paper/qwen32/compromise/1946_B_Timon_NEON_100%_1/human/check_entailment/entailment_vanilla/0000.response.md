Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(number):
       return number % 1000000007
   ```
   This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number. It is used to ensure that the final result is within the required modulo constraint.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   ```python
   def func_2(arr):
       new_segment = []
       max_segment = [0, 0]
       segments_variants = []
       max_sum = -1
       for i in range(len(arr)):
           if new_segment:
               if arr[i] < 0:
                   if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                   else:
                       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                       max_segment = new_segment
                   new_segment = []
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
               else:
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                   new_segment[0] += arr[i]
           else:
               if arr[i] >= 0:
                   new_segment = [arr[i], i]
               max_segment[0] += arr[i]
       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       total_max_segment = [-1]
       for segment in segments_variants:
           if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
               total_max_segment = segment
       return total_max_segment
   ```
   This function attempts to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum along with its starting and ending indices. However, there are a few issues:
   - The function does not correctly handle the case where all elements are negative. It should return `[0, 0, 0]` in that case.
   - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. For example, the line `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` incorrectly adds the current element to `max_segment` even if `arr[i]` is negative.
   - The function does not correctly handle the scenario where the maximum segment is at the end of the array.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   ```python
   def func_3(number, quantity):
       answer = 0
   ```
   This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation. It should compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to several issues in the implementation of `func_2` and the incomplete implementation of `func_3`. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
