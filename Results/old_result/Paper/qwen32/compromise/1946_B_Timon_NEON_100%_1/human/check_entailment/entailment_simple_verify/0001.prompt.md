You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program includes three functions:
1. **func_1(number)**: This function returns the given number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
2. **func_2(arr)**: This function seems to be intended to find the maximum sum subarray within the given array `arr`. It initializes several variables and iterates through the array to find the maximum sum subarray and its endpoints.
3. **func_3(number, quantity)**: This function is incomplete and doesn't seem to perform any action.

### Key Points:
- The problem requires us to perform `k` operations to maximize the sum of the array.
- The best strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum sum subarray to the array, as this will maximize the sum.
- The maximum sum subarray can be found using Kadane's algorithm, which is a well-known approach for this problem.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incomplete Functionality**: `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform any action. It should handle the logic of performing `k` operations.
2. **Incorrect Implementation**: `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum subarray, but it has logical errors. It does not correctly handle cases where the maximum sum subarray is at the beginning or end of the array, and it does not handle arrays with all negative numbers correctly.
3. **Lack of Main Logic**: The program lacks the main logic to perform the operations and compute the final result.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct as it does not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it lacks the main logic to perform the operations and compute the final result, and `func_2` has logical errors.

**Correctness: False**
