Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The given array a is beautiful according to the problem's definition, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
