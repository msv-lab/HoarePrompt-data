The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5. After executing this line, the value of `n` is updated to the integer provided by the input, while the other conditions (such as the range of `n` and the properties of the list `a`) remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n.**
