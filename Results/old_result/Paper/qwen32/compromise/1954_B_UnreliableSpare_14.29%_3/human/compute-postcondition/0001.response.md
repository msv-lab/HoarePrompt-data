The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n

The code does not affect `t` or `a`. It introduces a new variable `arr` which is populated with integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
