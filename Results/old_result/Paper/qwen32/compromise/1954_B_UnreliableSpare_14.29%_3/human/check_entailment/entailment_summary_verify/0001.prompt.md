You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It determines if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements in `arr` that are the same before a different element is encountered.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its neighbors if they are equal.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Checking if the array is uniform:** The program first checks if the entire array is uniform (all elements are the same). If it is, it correctly outputs `-1` because a uniform array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Finding the minimum segment:** The program then tries to find the minimum segment of consecutive elements that are the same. It does this by iterating through the array and updating a counter `cnt` for each segment of the same number. It keeps track of the minimum count of any segment in `ans`.

3. **Incorrect logic:** The logic of finding the minimum segment count and using it as the answer is incorrect. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, not to find the smallest segment. The smallest segment might not be the correct answer because removing elements from larger segments might be more effective in making the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to analyze the array structure and determine the minimum number of removals required. A correct approach might involve identifying the longest segments of the same number and considering how removing elements from these segments would affect the array's beauty.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to account for the correct logic needed to determine the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
