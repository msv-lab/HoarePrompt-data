### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - No digit should come after a letter.
   - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each password.
   - It separates letters and digits into two lists.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted individually.
   - It checks if any digit follows a letter in the password.

3. **Annotated Code Review:**
   - The program correctly separates letters and digits.
   - It verifies that the letters and digits are sorted.
   - It verifies that no digit follows a letter by iterating through the password and checking the order of characters.

4. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment claims the program is incorrect.
   - It provides a test case "abc12" which should return "NO" but the program returns "YES".

5. **Validation of Original Assessment:**
   - The provided test case "abc12" is indeed a valid test case.
   - The program should return "NO" for "abc12" because the digit '1' comes after the letter 'c'.
   - However, the program correctly identifies this scenario and returns "NO".

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is incorrect because the program correctly identifies and handles the case where a digit follows a letter.
   - The program fulfills all the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
