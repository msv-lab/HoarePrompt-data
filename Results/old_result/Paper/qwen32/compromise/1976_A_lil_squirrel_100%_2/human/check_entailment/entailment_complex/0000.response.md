### Reasoning:
The provided program checks the three conditions specified for a strong password:

1. **Sorting of Letters**: The program checks if all the letters in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Sorting of Digits**: The program checks if all the digits in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Order of Letters and Digits**: The program ensures that no digit comes immediately after a letter in the password.

The program iterates through the password to separate letters and digits, checks their respective sorted order, and verifies the order of letters and digits as per the given conditions.

Let's break down the steps in the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: Two lists, `letters` and `digits`, are initialized to store the letters and digits from the password, respectively.
2. **Character Classification**: The program iterates through each character in the password and appends it to the `letters` list if it is a letter, or to the `digits` list if it is a digit.
3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
4. **Sorting Check for Digits**: The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
5. **Order Check**: The program iterates through the password to check if a digit follows a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
6. **Return 'YES'**: If all checks pass, the program returns 'YES'.

Given these steps, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the provided conditions.
