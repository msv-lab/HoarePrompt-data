The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` being an input integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop index and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is not yet initialized**
