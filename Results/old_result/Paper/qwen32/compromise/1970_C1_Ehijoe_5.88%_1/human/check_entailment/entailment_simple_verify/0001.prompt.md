You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Tree Structure**: The tree is described as having exactly two leaves and can be seen as an array. This means the tree forms a linear structure.
2. **Game Dynamics**: The game involves moving a stone along the tree. The player who cannot make a move loses.
3. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they will make the best possible move at each turn.
4. **Starting Node**: The starting node for the stone is given.
5. **Objective**: Determine the winner of the game based on the starting node.

### Key Observations:
- Since the tree is linear (like an array), the game essentially reduces to a linear movement problem.
- The first player (Ron) wins if he can force the second player (Hermione) into a position where she cannot move.
- The game can be analyzed by determining the distance from the starting node to the nearest leaf. If this distance is odd, Ron wins because he can always force Hermione into a losing position. If it is even, Hermione wins.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Tree Construction**:
   - The program constructs the tree as a deque (double-ended queue). This is appropriate given the linear nature of the tree.
   - The logic for appending nodes to the deque seems correct; it ensures that the tree structure is maintained as a linear sequence.

2. **Determine Starting Node**:
   - The program reads the starting node and finds its index in the deque.
   
3. **Calculate Moves**:
   - The program calculates the minimum moves to the nearest leaf from the starting node. This is done by checking the distance from the start node to both ends of the deque.
   
4. **Determine Winner**:
   - The program checks if either of the calculated moves is odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the distance to the nearest leaf is correct.
- The program correctly constructs the tree and calculates the necessary distances.
- The output is based on the correct condition: Ron wins if any of the distances is odd, and Hermione wins if both distances are even.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the starting node and the structure of the tree.

Correctness: **True**
