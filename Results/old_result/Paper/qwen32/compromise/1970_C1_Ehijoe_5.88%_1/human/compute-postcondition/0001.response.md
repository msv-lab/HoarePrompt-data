The code snippet provided initializes a deque named `tree`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the pairs of integers representing the edges of the tree, or the starting node of the stone. The only change is the creation of the `tree` deque, which is initially empty.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node of the stone where 1 <= u_1 <= n, `tree` is an empty deque**.
