Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, and a single integer `u_1` representing the starting node of a stone. The function returns the result based on the structure of the tree and the starting node. Specifically, if the input represents a valid tree with exactly two leaves, the function returns the number of steps required to move the stone from the starting node to one of the leaves.**
