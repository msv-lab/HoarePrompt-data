n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer and t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node of the stone where 1 <= u_1 <= n.
