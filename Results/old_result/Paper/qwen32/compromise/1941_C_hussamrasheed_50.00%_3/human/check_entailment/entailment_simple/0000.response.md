Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s`. It first counts the occurrences of "map", removes all "map" substrings from `s`, and then counts the occurrences of "pie" in the modified string. The sum of these counts is then printed as the result for each test case, representing the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

However, there is a flaw in this approach. By removing all occurrences of "map" and then counting "pie", the program does not correctly account for cases where removing a character could break a "map" or "pie" substring such that fewer deletions are needed overall. For example, in the string "mpie", the program would count one "map" and one "pie" and output 2, but only one deletion (removing 'm') is needed to make the string beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is required, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of deletions while considering overlapping substrings.

Correctness: **False**
