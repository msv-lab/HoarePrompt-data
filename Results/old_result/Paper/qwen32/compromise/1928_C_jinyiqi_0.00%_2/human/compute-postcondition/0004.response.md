The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `output1`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `output2` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing the integer `i`; `output2` is an empty list; `i` is an integer such that `x % i == 0`.**
