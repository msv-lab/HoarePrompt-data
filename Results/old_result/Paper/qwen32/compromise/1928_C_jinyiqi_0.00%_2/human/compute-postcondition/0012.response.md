The provided code snippet increments `i` by 1 and then appends the new value of `i` to the list `output1`. 

Given the initial state, `x` and `n` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, ensuring `i` is still within the range `[1, int(x)]`. The code modifies `i` and appends it to `output1`.

Since the exact previous value of `i` is not specified, we denote its new value as `i + 1`. The list `output1` will now include this new value of `i`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is incremented by 1; `output1` includes the new value of `i`.**
