The value of `output2` is updated by appending the integer result of `x / i`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `output1` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list with the new element `i-1` appended, `output2` is a list with an additional element `int(x / i)`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
