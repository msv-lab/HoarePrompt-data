The code appends the integer value of `x / i` to the list `output2`. The values of `x`, `n`, `output1`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. The only change is that `output2`, which was initially an empty list, now contains the integer value of `x / i`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing the integer `i`; `output2` is a list containing the integer `x / i`; `i` is an integer such that `x % i == 0`.**
