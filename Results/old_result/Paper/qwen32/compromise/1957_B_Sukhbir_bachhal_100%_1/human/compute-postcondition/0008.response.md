The right shift operation `n >>= 1` divides the value of `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Given that `n` must be at least 2 before the right shift, the smallest possible value for `n` is 2. After the operation, if `n` was 2, it will become 1. If `n` was any other value greater than 2, it will be halved (integer division).

Since the initial state only specifies that `n` must be at least 2, we can't determine the exact value of `n` after the operation without more information, but we know it will be `n // 2`. The `position` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`position` is 1, `n` is `n // 2`**.
