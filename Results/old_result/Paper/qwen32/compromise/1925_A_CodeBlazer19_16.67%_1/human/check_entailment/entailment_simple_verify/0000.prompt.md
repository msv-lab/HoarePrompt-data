You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

If `k` is equal to 1, then `s` is "a". Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 1, and `s` is a string of `k` consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible substrings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The string `s` should be of the smallest possible length.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
```

### Analysis
1. **Initialization of `s`**:
   - The program initializes `s` with the first `k` lowercase English letters.
   - For example, if `k = 3`, `s` will be `"abc"`.

2. **Handling `k == 1`**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program outputs `n` repetitions of the single character.
   - For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the output will be `"aaa"`.
   - This is correct because the only possible substring of length `n` is `n` repetitions of the single character.

3. **Handling `k > 1`**:
   - If `k > 1`, the program outputs either `s` or `2 * s` based on the value of `n`.
   - Specifically, if `n == 1`, it outputs `s`; otherwise, it outputs `2 * s`.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output will be `"abcabc"`.
   - For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the output will be `"abc"`.

### Checking Correctness
We need to verify if the generated string `s` contains all possible substrings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets as subsequences.

1. **Case `n = 1`**:
   - The program outputs `s`, which contains all single characters from `a` to `k`.
   - This is correct.

2. **Case `n > 1`**:
   - The program outputs either `s` or `2 * s`.
   - For `2 * s`, it ensures that all possible substrings of length `n` can be found as subsequences.
   - However, the program does not guarantee the smallest possible length for `s`.

### Potential Issues
- The program does not ensure the smallest possible length for `s` when `n > 1`.
- For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `"abab"`, but the smallest string that contains all substrings of length 2 is `"aabbab"`.

### Conclusion
The program does not always generate the smallest possible string `s` that contains all possible substrings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets as subsequences.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program does not handle the requirement to generate the smallest possible string `s` for all cases, especially when `n > 1`. For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output `"abab"` is not the smallest string that contains all substrings of length 2 (`"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`), as `"aabbab"` is a smaller valid string.
