Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The string `s` should be of the smallest possible length.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. It then constructs a string `s` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
```

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **String Construction**: The string `s` is constructed by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. However, this does not guarantee that all subsequences of length `n` are included in `s`.
2. **Handling of `n` and `k` Values**:
   - When `k == 1`, the program correctly prints `n` copies of the single character, which is the only possible subsequence of length `n`.
   - For `k > 1`, the program prints either `s` or `2 * s` based on the value of `n`. This does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included in `s`.

### Correct Approach:
To construct the string `s` such that all subsequences of length `n` are included, we need to ensure that every possible combination of `n` characters from the first `k` characters appears as a subsequence. One way to achieve this is to use a De Bruijn sequence for subsequences of length `n` over an alphabet of size `k`.

However, the program does not implement this approach. Instead, it simply concatenates the first `k` characters and repeats it, which is not sufficient to generate all subsequences of length `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
