Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible substrings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The string `s` should be of the smallest possible length.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
```

### Analysis
1. **Initialization of `s`**:
   - The program initializes `s` with the first `k` lowercase English letters.
   - For example, if `k = 3`, `s` will be `"abc"`.

2. **Handling `k == 1`**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program outputs `n` repetitions of the single character.
   - For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the output will be `"aaa"`.
   - This is correct because the only possible substring of length `n` is `n` repetitions of the single character.

3. **Handling `k > 1`**:
   - If `k > 1`, the program outputs either `s` or `2 * s` based on the value of `n`.
   - Specifically, if `n == 1`, it outputs `s`; otherwise, it outputs `2 * s`.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output will be `"abcabc"`.
   - For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the output will be `"abc"`.

### Checking Correctness
We need to verify if the generated string `s` contains all possible substrings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets as subsequences.

1. **Case `n = 1`**:
   - The program outputs `s`, which contains all single characters from `a` to `k`.
   - This is correct.

2. **Case `n > 1`**:
   - The program outputs either `s` or `2 * s`.
   - For `2 * s`, it ensures that all possible substrings of length `n` can be found as subsequences.
   - However, the program does not guarantee the smallest possible length for `s`.

### Potential Issues
- The program does not ensure the smallest possible length for `s` when `n > 1`.
- For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `"abab"`, but the smallest string that contains all substrings of length 2 is `"aabbab"`.

### Conclusion
The program does not always generate the smallest possible string `s` that contains all possible substrings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets as subsequences.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program does not handle the requirement to generate the smallest possible string `s` for all cases, especially when `n > 1`. For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output `"abab"` is not the smallest string that contains all substrings of length 2 (`"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`), as `"aabbab"` is a smaller valid string.
