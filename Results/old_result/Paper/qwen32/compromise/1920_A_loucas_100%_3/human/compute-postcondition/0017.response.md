Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer read from input, and `a` is the second integer read from input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**
