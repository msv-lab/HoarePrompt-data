Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is 1, `a` is the second integer read from input.** 

In natural language: The value of `a` has been appended to the list `big`. All other variables retain their initial values.
