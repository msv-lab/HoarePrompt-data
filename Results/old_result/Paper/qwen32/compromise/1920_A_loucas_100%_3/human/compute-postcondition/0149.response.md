To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop evolves with each iteration. The loop processes a series of constraints and calculates a value `num` based on these constraints. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: For each iteration, three lists (`less`, `big`, `no`) are initialized to store different types of constraints.
2. **Input Processing**: For each inner loop iteration, constraints are read and categorized into `less`, `big`, or `no` based on their type.
3. **Calculation of `num`**:
   - `num` is initially calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.
   - If `num` is less than 1, it is set to 0.
   - For each value in `no`, if it falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`, `num` is decremented by 1.
4. **Output**: The value of `num` is printed after processing each set of constraints.

The key point here is that the state of `num` is recalculated from scratch for each outer loop iteration based on the new set of constraints provided in the inner loop. Therefore, the final output state is simply the result of the last iteration of the loop.

Given that the problem specifies the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the final output state will be the result of the last iteration, which is the `num` value calculated in the last inner loop.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for the last iteration, we can generalize the final output state as the result of the last calculation of `num`.

### Final Output State
The final output state is the value of `num` calculated in the last iteration of the loop.

Output State: **num = min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count_in_range for the last iteration**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the value of `num` after processing the constraints in the last iteration of the loop, where `num` is adjusted based on the minimum and maximum values of the respective constraint types and the count of constraints that fall within a specific range.
