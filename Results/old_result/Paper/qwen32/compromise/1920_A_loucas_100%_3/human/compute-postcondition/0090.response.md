Postcondition: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least one element. If `i` is such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` remains `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.**
