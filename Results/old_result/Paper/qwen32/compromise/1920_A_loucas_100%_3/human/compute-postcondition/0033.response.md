The code snippet calculates the new value of `num` based on the minimum value in the `less` list and the maximum value in the `big` list. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the calculation for `num`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- Constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9
- There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2
- `loop` is greater than 0
- `num` is 0
- `innerLoop` is greater than 0
- `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1
- `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2
- `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 3

After executing the line `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1`, the value of `num` is updated to be the minimum value in the `less` list minus the maximum value in the `big` list plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 3.**
