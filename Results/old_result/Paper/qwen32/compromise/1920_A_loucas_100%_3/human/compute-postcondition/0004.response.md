The given Python code snippet only initializes an empty list named `no`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `constraints`, `loop`, `less`, `big`) are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` must be greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**
