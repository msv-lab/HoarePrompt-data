Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 4, `loop` is greater than 4, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list containing `a` (if `x` is 1, `big` contains two instances of `a`; otherwise, `big` contains one instance of `a`), `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, `no` is a list containing `a` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, otherwise `big` and `less` are empty lists and `no` is an empty list, `iterable2` is 1.**
