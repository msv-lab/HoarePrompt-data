The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the list `no`. If there are more values in the list `no` to iterate over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the next value in the list `no`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another value in the list `no` to assign to `i`.

State: **`i` is the next value in the list `no`, `num` remains unchanged (since we don't know if the previous `i` met the condition to decrease `num`)**

However, to be more precise about the state of `i` at the start of the next iteration, we should indicate that `i` is now the subsequent value from the list `no`:

State: **`i` is the next value in the list `no`**
