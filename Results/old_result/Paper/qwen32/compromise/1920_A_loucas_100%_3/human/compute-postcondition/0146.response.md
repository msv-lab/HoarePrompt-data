Postcondition: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `iterable` is 4, `loop` is greater than 4, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `no` after the current `i`. If `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, `num` is updated to `min(less) - max(big)`.**
