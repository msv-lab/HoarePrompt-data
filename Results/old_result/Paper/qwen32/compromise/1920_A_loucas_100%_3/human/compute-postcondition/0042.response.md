The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the list `no`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take on the next value in the list `no`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be updated to the next value in the list `no`.

Since the specific values in the list `no` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact next value of `i`. However, we know that `i` should be the next element in the list `no`.

State: **`i` is the next value in the list `no`, `num` remains unchanged**
