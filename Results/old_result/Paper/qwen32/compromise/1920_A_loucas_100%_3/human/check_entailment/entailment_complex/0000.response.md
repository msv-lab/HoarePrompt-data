### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes three lists (`less`, `big`, `no`) to store constraints of types 2, 1, and 3 respectively. It also initializes a variable `num` to zero, which will eventually hold the count of valid integers `k`.

2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, the program reads the number of constraints `n` and then iterates through each constraint. Depending on the type of constraint (`a`), it appends the corresponding value `x` to the appropriate list:
   - Type 1 constraints (k ≥ x) are stored in the `big` list.
   - Type 2 constraints (k ≤ x) are stored in the `less` list.
   - Type 3 constraints (k ≠ x) are stored in the `no` list.

3. **Calculating Initial Range**: The program calculates the initial range of valid integers `k` by subtracting the maximum value from the `big` list (which represents the smallest allowed value for `k`) from the minimum value in the `less` list (which represents the largest allowed value for `k`). It adds 1 to this difference to account for the inclusive nature of the range:
   ```python
   num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
   ```

4. **Handling Type 3 Constraints**: If the calculated range `num` is positive, the program then iterates through the `no` list (type 3 constraints) and decrements `num` for each value in `no` that falls within the current range `[max(big), min(less)]`. This ensures that values explicitly excluded by type 3 constraints are not counted.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the resulting count `num` for each test case. If `num` is negative (indicating an impossible range), it prints `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including reading input, processing constraints, calculating the valid range, and adjusting for excluded values. The logic aligns with the problem requirements, and the provided example outputs match the expected results.
