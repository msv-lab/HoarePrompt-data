t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, the first element n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The following n lines contain pairs (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
