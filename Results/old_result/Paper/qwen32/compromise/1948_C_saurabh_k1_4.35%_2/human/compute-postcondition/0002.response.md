Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n is even) and two strings each of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given strings.**
