The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines whether the loop will execute. The loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variables `start` and `end` do not influence the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
