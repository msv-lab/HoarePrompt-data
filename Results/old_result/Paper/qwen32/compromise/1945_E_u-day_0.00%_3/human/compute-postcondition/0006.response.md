The code snippet provided initializes an empty set named `st`. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is `n_new`, `k` is `k_new`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `-1`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set.**
