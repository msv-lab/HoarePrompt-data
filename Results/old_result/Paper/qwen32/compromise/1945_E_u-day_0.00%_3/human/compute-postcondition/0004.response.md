To determine the output state, we need to consider the loop's behavior based on the given initial state and the loop code:

- The loop iterates `n` times, checking each element of the array `arr` to see if it matches `k`.
- If a match is found (i.e., `arr[i] == k`), the variable `pos` is updated to the current index `i`.
- If no match is found after all iterations, `pos` remains `-1`.

Therefore, after the loop completes:
- The value of `n` remains `n_new`.
- The value of `k` remains `k_new`.
- The value of `arr` remains the value returned by `func_2()`.
- The value of `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, it will remain `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is `n_new`, `k` is `k_new`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `-1`.**
