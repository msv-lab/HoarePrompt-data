Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an input value; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`; `no` is `True`; `counter` is equal to the length of `c`; every element `x` in `c` was found in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]`.**
