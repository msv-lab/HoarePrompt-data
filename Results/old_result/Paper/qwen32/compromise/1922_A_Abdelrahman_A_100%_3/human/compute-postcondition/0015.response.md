Based on the provided initial state and the given Python code snippet, the task is to determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `tests` must be greater than 0.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input value.
- `b` is an input value.
- `c` is an iterable with at least one element.
- `no` is False.
- `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.
- `counter` is 0.
- `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

From the code snippet, we see that the `print` statement is directly printing the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables and their values or conditions, but it does not affect the content of the string being printed. The `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables `tests`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `no`, `counter`, or `x`.

Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
