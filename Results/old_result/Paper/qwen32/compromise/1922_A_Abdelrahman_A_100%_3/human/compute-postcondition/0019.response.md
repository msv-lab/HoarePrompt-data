The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `c`. If `c` has more elements, the loop can execute again with the next element of `c`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` took the value of the first element in `c`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must have at least one more element. The value of `x` will be the next element in `c`.

State: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an iterable with at least two elements; `no` is False if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, otherwise `no` remains True; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`; `counter` is 1; `x` is the second element in `c`.**
