Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an integer read from input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        counter = 0
        for x in c:
            if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                no = False
                print('YES')
                break
            counter += 1
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an input value; if `no` is `True`, then `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and every element `x` in `c` was found in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]` with `counter` equal to the length of `c`. If `no` is `False`, the conditions regarding `c`, `a`, `b`, and `counter` remain as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is a new input integer; `a` is the new input value; `b` is the new input value; `c` is the new input value; `i` is the current iteration index + 1. If `no` is `True`, then `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`. Every element `x` in `c` must be found in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]` with `counter` equal to the length of `c`. If `no` is `False`, then `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is the new input value; `b` is the new input value; `c` is the new input value from `input()`. `i` is the current iteration index + 2. If `no` is True, then `c` does not equal `a` or `b`, and at least one `x` in `c` was not found in `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`. `counter` is equal to the length of `c`. If `no` is False, then `c` equals `a` or `b`, or all `x` in `c` were found in `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`. `counter` is equal to the length of `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
