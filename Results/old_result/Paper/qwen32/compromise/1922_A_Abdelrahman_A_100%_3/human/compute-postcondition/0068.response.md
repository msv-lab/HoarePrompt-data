Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is a new input integer; `a` is the new input value; `b` is the new input value; `c` is the new input value; `i` is the current iteration index + 1. If `no` is `True`, then `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`. Every element `x` in `c` must be found in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]` with `counter` equal to the length of `c`. If `no` is `False`, then `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`.**
