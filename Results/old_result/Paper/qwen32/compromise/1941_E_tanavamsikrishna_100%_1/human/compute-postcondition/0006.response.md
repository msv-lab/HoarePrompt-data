The only variables in the loop head are `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the `costs` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur. Since `costs` is a list of `n` elements, and the loop runs for `i` in the range `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was the value at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
