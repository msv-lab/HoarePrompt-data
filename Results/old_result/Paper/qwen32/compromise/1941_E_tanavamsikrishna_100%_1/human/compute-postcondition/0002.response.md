The given Python code snippet creates a new list `costs` by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the 2D list `rows`. The function `func_1` is called with two arguments: a row from `rows` and the integer `d`. The result of `func_1` for each row is stored in the `costs` list.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the specific values that will be in the `costs` list. However, we know that `costs` will be a list of the same length as `rows` (i.e., `n` elements), where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`.**
