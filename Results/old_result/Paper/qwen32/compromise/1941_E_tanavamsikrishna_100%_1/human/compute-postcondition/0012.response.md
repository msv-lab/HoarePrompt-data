Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of rows), `m` (a positive integer representing the number of columns), `k` (a positive integer representing the number of bridges such that 1 <= k <= n), and `d` (a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= d <= m). The function returns a configuration or arrangement of bridges based on the given constraints.**
