The code snippet provided adds the list `e` to the `min_heap` using the `heappush` function. This operation modifies the `min_heap` by adding the list `e` to it, but it does not affect the values of `row` or `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`
- `min_heap` is `[]`
- `d` must be less than `len(row)`

After executing the code:
- The `min_heap` will now contain the list `e`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`, `min_heap` is `[e]`, `d` must be less than `len(row)`**.
