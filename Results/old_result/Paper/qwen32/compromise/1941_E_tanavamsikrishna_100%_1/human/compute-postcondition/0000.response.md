The provided code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. Since the initial state already specifies that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with specific constraints, the code will simply update these variables with the new input values while maintaining their constraints.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the values provided by the input, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges such that 1 <= k <= n, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= d <= m.**
