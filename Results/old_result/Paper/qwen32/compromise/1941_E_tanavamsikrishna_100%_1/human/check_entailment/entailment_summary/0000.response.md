### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost of placing supports on a single row of the river grid.
   - It initializes the first `d` elements of the row in a specific way and then uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports for the remaining elements while adhering to the constraints.
   - The output hint correctly describes the behavior of the function, which modifies the input list `row` and returns the last element of the modified list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input parameters and the grid.
   - It computes the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in the `costs` list.
   - It then calculates the total cost for every possible configuration of `k` consecutive rows and stores these in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.

### Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The logic for updating the costs in `func_1` is based on the problem's requirement to find the minimum cost of placing supports while ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
  - The use of a min-heap ensures that the function can efficiently find the minimum cost in the sliding window of size `d+1`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function properly reads the input and processes each row to get the individual costs.
  - It correctly computes the total cost for every possible configuration of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.

### Conclusion:

Both functions together meet the problem description. `func_1` correctly computes the cost for a single row, and `func_2` correctly aggregates these costs over `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
