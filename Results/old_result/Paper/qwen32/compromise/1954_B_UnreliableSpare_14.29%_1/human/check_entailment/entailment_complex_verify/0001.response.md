### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness based on the given annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- An array is **beautiful** if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly using the operation: choose an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` and replace `a_i` with `a_{i - 1}`.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. If it's impossible, output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check if All Elements are the Same**:
   - The program initializes a `flag` to `True`.
   - It iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks the loop.

3. **Calculate Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting the length of contiguous segments of the same value.
   - When it encounters a different value, it updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and the count of the previous segment.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` with the count of the last segment.
   - If all elements were the same (`flag` is `True`), it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count stored in `ans`.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly identifies if all elements are the same and calculates the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same value.
- However, the annotations do not address whether the minimum segment length is the correct answer for the problem.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Flawed Logic for Minimum Removals**:
   - The program assumes that removing the shortest segment will make the array stop being beautiful. This is incorrect.
   - Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`:
     - The shortest segment is of length 1 (either the `2` or the `3`).
     - Removing either of these does not make the array stop being beautiful because you can still apply the operation to make all elements `1`.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`:
     - The shortest segment is of length 1 (the `5`).
     - Removing the `5` results in `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, which is still beautiful.
     - The correct answer is 3, as removing the first three `3`s results in `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the beautiful property of the array and may output incorrect results.

**Final: False**
