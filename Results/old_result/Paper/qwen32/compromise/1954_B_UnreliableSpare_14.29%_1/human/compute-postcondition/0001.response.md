The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string values, converts each of these string values to an integer, and then stores them in a list named `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold the integers provided in the input.

The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `a` are already defined. The code does not affect `t` or `n`. The variable `a` is described as a list of `n` integers, but it is not modified by this code snippet. Instead, a new list `arr` is created and populated with the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
