### Reasoning:

The program is designed to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` (bitwise XOR) is maximized. To achieve this, it uses a series of queries to compare bitwise OR operations between different pairs of elements in the secret permutation `p`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the First Candidate (ans1)**:
   - It initializes `ans1` to `0`.
   - It iterates over each index `i` from `1` to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it performs a query `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)` which compares `(p_ans1 | p_ans1)` and `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`. This ensures that `ans1` ends up being an index with one of the largest values in the permutation `p`.

3. **Finding the Second Candidate (mx and v)**:
   - It initializes `mx` to `0` and `v` to `[0]`.
   - It iterates over each index `i` from `1` to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it performs a query `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)` which compares `(p_mx | p_ans1)` and `(p_i | p_ans1)`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it empties the list `v`, updates `mx` to `i`, and adds `i` to `v`. This means `mx` is updated to an index with a larger bitwise OR value with `ans1`.
   - If the result of the query is `=`, it adds `i` to `v`. This means multiple indices have the same bitwise OR value with `ans1`.
   - After the loop, `mx` is set to the first element of `v`, and `ans` is also set to the first element of `v`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair**:
   - It iterates over each index `i` in `v` starting from the second element.
   - For each `i`, it performs a query `func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])` which compares `(p_ans | p_ans)` and `(p_v[i] | p_v[i])`.
   - If the result of the query is `>`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`. This ensures that `ans` ends up being an index with one of the largest values in `v`.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - Finally, it prints `! ans ans1`, which are the indices of the pair with the maximum XOR.

### Analysis:

- The program logically ensures that `ans1` is an index with one of the largest values in the permutation.
- The list `v` contains indices that have the highest bitwise OR value with `ans1`.
- The program then finds the index in `v` that has the highest value, ensuring that the XOR between `ans` and `ans1` is maximized.
- The number of queries is at most `3n`, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the strategy to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value using the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
