To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the `print` statement is executed.

### Given Initial State:
- `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero.
- `ul` remains unchanged.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- If `re` equals `k`, then `res` includes all `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1. Otherwise, `re` does not equal `k` and no further changes are made to `res`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs the value of `a[i]` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).
- `i` is incremented by 1 before this print statement, so the value of `a[i]` is the element in the list `a` at the index `i` after it has been incremented.
- The value of `a[i]` depends on the initial values of `a` and the specific value of `i` before the increment. Since the exact list `a` and the value of `i` before the increment are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the value of `i` after it has been incremented.

### Output:
Given the information provided, the output will be the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`, after `i` has been incremented by 1.

Output: **a[i] (where i is the index after being incremented by 1 and a is the list containing the elements)**
