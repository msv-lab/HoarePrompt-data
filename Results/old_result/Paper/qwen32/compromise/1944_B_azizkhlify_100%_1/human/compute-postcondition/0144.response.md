The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to increment `i` by 1 for the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound for the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**  
Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again from its current value. Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`**

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i_end`, we can simply say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**  
This can be more precisely stated as:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**  
But sticking to the format provided:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
