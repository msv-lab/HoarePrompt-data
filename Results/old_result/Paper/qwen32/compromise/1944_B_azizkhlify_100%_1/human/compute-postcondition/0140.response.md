The value of `ul` is incremented by 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and `ul` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ul` is increased by 2**.
