Let's analyze the given task step by step based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. The variable `i` is defined as `n + 1`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` will be at least 1.
2. The code attempts to print `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and ends the output with a space instead of a newline.

### Key Points:
- The array or list `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we do not know its contents.
- Since `i` is `n + 1`, we need to consider the length of `a` to determine if `a[i]` is a valid index.
- If `a` has fewer than `i` elements (i.e., fewer than `n + 1` elements), accessing `a[i]` will result in an `IndexError`.

### Conclusion:
Since the list `a` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `a[i]`. However, based on the information provided, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the index `i`.

### Output:
The code will attempt to print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and end the output with a space. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, if `a` has at least `n + 1` elements, it will print the element at that index twice. If `a` has fewer than `n + 1` elements, it will raise an `IndexError`.

Output: **a[i], a[i] (where i is n + 1 and a is the list whose element at index i is being accessed)**
