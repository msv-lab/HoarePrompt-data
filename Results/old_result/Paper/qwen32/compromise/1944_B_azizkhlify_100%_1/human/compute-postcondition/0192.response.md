The code snippet `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. The initial state describes conditions on `n` and `r`, but `ur` is not mentioned. Since `ur` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume it was defined previously and is being modified here. The values of `n` and `r` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `r` is a list such that the element at index `a[i] - 1` is equal to 0; all other elements in `r` remain unchanged; `ur` is increased by 2.**
