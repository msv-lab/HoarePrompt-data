Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:
- `res` is a list containing at least one element.
- `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, but their specific values are not provided.
- `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is explicitly stated to be 0. The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that a space should be printed at the end of the output instead of the default newline character.

Thus, the output will simply be the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **0 **
