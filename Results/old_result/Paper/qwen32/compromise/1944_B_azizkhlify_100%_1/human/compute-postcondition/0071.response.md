Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` remains the same; `a` remains the same; `l` remains the same; `r` remains the same; `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends; `ur` remains `0`. If `k` is non-zero, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the value of `i` when `re` equals `k`. If `k` is zero, `i` remains unchanged. `re` is the total number of elements added to `res` (which is `k` if the loop breaks due to `re` reaching `k`); `res` contains all elements from `a` that had a count of `1` in `l` up to the point of breaking or completing all iterations. If `k` is zero, `res` remains an empty list.**
