Postcondition: **`k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and remains non-zero; `ul` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is the last element in `res`, which contains all elements `a[i]` such that `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` and all elements have been printed; `a` and `l` remain unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` can be `2 * n` or the loop breaks when `ul` equals `ur`, and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each element `a[i]` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, with those elements in `r` set to 0. Otherwise, no additional changes occur to `ur` or `r`.**
