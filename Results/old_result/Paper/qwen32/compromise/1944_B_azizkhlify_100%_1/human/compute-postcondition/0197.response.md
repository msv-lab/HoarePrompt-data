The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was in the range `[n, 2 * n)`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`** (where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration, incremented by 1). No changes are needed to `ul`, `ur`, or `r` as per the loop head variables.

Since we don't have the specific value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can express the state as:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
