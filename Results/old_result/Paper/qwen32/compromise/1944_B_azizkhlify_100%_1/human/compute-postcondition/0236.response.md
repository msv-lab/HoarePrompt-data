Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list where each element at index j is the count of how many times j+1 appears in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros except that the element at index `a[n] - 1` is `n`, the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is `n-1`, ..., the element at index `a[2*n-1] - 1` is 1, `i` is 2 * n - 1 (this value will be overwritten by the loop), `re` is 0, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.**
