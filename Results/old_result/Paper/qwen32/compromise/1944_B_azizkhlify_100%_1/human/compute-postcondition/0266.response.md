Postcondition: **`ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop breaks early or the sum of all increments of 2 that occurred during the iterations if the loop completes all `n` iterations. `ur` remains 0. `res` is a list containing `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list. `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. `i` is 0. `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 0. `k` is not 0. `n` must be greater than 0.**
