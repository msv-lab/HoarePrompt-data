To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context of the variables involved.

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` are variables whose specific values are not provided, but they remain constant.
- `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends.
- `ur` remains `0`.
- `res` contains more than one element.
- `i` is the third element in `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space. Since `i` is the third element in the list `res`, we need to determine the value of this third element.

However, the specific values of the elements in `res` are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe `i` in terms of its position in the list `res`.

Given this information, the output will be the third element of the list `res`, followed by a space.

Output: **the third element of the list `res` (where `res` is a list containing more than one element and `i` is the third element in `res`)**
