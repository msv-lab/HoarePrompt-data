Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` was 2, it is set to 0 and `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `r` or `ur`. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
