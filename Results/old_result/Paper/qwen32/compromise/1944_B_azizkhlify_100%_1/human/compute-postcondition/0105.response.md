Postcondition: **All elements in `res` are printed, separated by spaces. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then all elements in `res` that meet the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` are printed twice, separated by spaces, and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each such element. `ul` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, no additional elements are printed and `ur` remains unchanged.**
