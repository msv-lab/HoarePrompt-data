The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list where `l[j]` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros except `r[a[n] - 1]` which is incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`**
