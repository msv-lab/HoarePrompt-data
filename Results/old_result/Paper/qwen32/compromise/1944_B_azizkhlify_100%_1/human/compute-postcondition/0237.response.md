To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state step by step:

1. **List `a`**: It's a list of integers obtained from the input.
2. **Variable `i`**: Initially set to `2 * n - 1`, but this value is overwritten by the loop. However, the problem specifies that `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2. This implies that after the loop, the value of `a[i]` is such that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.
3. **List `l`**: This list keeps track of the count of how many times each integer (from 1 to `n`) appears in the list `a`. Specifically, `l[j]` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.

Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it means that the integer `a[i]` appears exactly 2 times in the list `a`.

Since `i` is the index in the list `a` where the element at that index appears exactly twice, the `print` statement will print the same value twice, separated by a space.

However, the exact numerical value of `a[i]` cannot be determined from the given information alone, as it depends on the specific input list `a`.

Thus, the output can be described as:

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the integer that appears exactly twice in the list `a`)**
