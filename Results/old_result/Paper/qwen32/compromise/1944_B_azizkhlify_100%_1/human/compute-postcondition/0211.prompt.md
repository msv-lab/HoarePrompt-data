Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` and remains non-zero; `ul` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is the last element in `res`; `re` is the count of elements in `a` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`; `res` contains all such elements `a[i]` and all elements have been printed; `a` and `l` remain unchanged; `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, `r` is a list such that if `r[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is now equal to 0, all other elements in `r` remain unchanged, and `ur` is increased by 2; otherwise, no changes are made to `r` or `ur`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, no changes are made to `r` or `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` was 2, it is set to 0 and `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `r` or `ur`. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`. If `ul` equals `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `ur` remains unchanged. If `ul` does not equal `ur`, the program does not break out of the loop or if statement. The value of `ur` remains unchanged regardless of the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
