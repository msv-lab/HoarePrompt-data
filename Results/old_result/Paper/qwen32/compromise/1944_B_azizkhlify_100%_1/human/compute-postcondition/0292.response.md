Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `res` is a list containing at least three elements.
- `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged (though their values are not specified, they are not used in the print statement).
- `i` is the third element in `res`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- Since `i` is defined as the third element in the list `res`, we can denote it as `res[2]` (since list indices in Python are zero-based).
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that after printing the value of `i`, a space (' ') should be printed instead of the default newline.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of the third element in the list `res`, followed by a space.

### Output:
Output: **res[2] ** (where `res[2]` is the third element of the list `res`)
