Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `ul` is either `k * 2 + 2` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ul` remains `k * 2` or 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is the list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the list `a` except `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros except that the element at index `a[n] - 1` is `n`, the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is `n-1`, ..., the element at index `a[2*n-1] - 1` is 1, `i` is 0, `re` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, none of the variables' values change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
