The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`, `l`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `ul` remains unchanged, `ur` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged.**
