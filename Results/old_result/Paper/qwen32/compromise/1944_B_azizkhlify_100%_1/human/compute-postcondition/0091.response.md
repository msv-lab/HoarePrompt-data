To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the code itself.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `i` (which implies `i` is some integer, but its specific value is not provided).
- The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it exists and has at least `i + 1` elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a[i]`**: The code attempts to access the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since the list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`. However, we know that `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

2. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement is printing `a[i]` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` argument.

### Output:
Given the information, the output will be the value at index `i` of the list `a`, printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
