### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program step by step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the given icons.

#### Key Points:
1. **Grid Size:** Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
2. **Icon Sizes:** 
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells.
3. **Objective:** Minimize the number of screens needed to place all icons.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Input:** `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons).
2. **Logic:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - Calculate `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, considering that each screen can fit at most 2 of these icons (4 cells each, and a screen has 15 cells).
     - Update `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This formula seems incorrect because it subtracts 15 cells for each screen used for 2x2 icons and then adds back the cells occupied by those icons. This adjustment is likely intended to account for the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons, but it is flawed.
     - Calculate `bxsfory1` as `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. This part is intended to calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Print the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.
   - If `x == 0` and `y > 0`:
     - Simply print `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct.
   - If `x > 0` and `y == 0`:
     - Print `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is correct.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, print `0`, which is correct.

#### Flaw in the Logic:
The critical flaw is in the formula used to update `x` after placing the 2x2 icons. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons. Instead, it should calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in those remaining cells.

#### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - 4 * y`.
3. Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `bxsfory1 = math.ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)` if `remaining_cells < x`, otherwise `0`.
4. Print the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
