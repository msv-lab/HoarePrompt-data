The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state specifies that `t` is already a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, the execution of this code will replace the existing value of `t` with the new integer input value. Since we are not given the specific input value, we can only state that `t` will be whatever positive integer is provided by the input, within the same specified range.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, as provided by the input.**
