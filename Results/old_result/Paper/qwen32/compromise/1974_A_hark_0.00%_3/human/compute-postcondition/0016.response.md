Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`. If either `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, or if `x` equals 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the values of `x` and `y` remain as they were obtained from the input, with `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`.**
