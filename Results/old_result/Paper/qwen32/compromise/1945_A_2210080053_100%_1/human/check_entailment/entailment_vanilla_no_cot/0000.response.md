Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the number of tents required based on the given constraints. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of tents is incorrect and does not properly account for the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The program combines extroverts and universals into a single group (`b += c`). This is incorrect because extroverts require specific pairs, while universals can be flexibly assigned.

2. The formula `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is not correctly calculating the number of tents. The logic is flawed as it does not properly account for the introverts who need individual tents, the extroverts who need to be in groups of three, and the flexible universals.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(input[index])
        b = int(input[index + 1])
        c = int(input[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        # Each introvert needs one tent
        tents = a
        
        # Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with two others
        # We can use universals to fill these spots
        pairs_needed = b
        if pairs_needed * 2 <= c:
            # We have enough universals to fill all extroverts' needs
            tents += pairs_needed
            c -= pairs_needed * 2
        elif pairs_needed * 2 <= c + (a % 3):
            # We might be able to use some of the remaining universals after accommodating introverts
            tents += pairs_needed
            c -= pairs_needed * 2 - (a % 3)
        else:
            # Not enough universals to satisfy all extroverts
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Now, we need to accommodate remaining introverts and universals
        # Each tent can have at most 3 people
        remaining_people = a % 3 + c
        tents += (remaining_people + 2) // 3
        
        print(tents)

func()
```

This corrected version properly separates the handling of introverts, extroverts, and universals, ensuring that all constraints are met.
