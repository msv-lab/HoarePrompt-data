The function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The function returns the maximum value among the three integers for each test case.
