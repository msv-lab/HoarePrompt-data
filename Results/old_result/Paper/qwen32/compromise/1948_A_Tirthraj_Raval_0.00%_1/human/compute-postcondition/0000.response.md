The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given that the initial state specifies `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, after executing this line, `t` will be replaced by the value provided by the input, which is also expected to be within the range of 1 to 50. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer within the range 1 to 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**
