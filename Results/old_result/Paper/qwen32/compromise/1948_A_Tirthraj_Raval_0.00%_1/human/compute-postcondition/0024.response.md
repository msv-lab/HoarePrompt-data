The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pattern`. This action does not change the values of `t` or `n`, nor does it create the `pattern` list with alternating 'A' and 'B' characters or set the value of `i`. Therefore, the state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged, and `pattern` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 49; `n` is an input integer; `pattern` is an empty list.**
