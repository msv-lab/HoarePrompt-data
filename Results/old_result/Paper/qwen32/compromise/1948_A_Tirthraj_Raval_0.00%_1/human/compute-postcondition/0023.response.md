Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 49.
- `n` is an input integer.
- If `n` is odd, no additional changes are made.
- If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list of `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B'.
- `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.

### Code to be Executed:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `pattern`, or `i`. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

### Output:
The code will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
