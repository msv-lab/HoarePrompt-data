Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 49.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. If `n` is odd, no additional changes are made.
4. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list of `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. This output is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `pattern`, and `i`. The `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, so their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will always be `'NO'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **NO**
