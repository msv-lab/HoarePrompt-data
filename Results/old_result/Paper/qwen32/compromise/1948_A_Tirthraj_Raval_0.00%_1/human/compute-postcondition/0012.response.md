Output State: **`t` is the input integer within the range 1 to 50, `n` is an even integer and must be at least 2, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B'], `i` is 1**

Explanation: The `pattern` list is updated to include an additional element. Since `i` is 1, `i % 2` evaluates to 1, and `'AB'[1]` is `'B'`. Therefore, `'B'` is appended to the `pattern` list, changing it from `['A', 'B']` to `['A', 'B', 'B']`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
