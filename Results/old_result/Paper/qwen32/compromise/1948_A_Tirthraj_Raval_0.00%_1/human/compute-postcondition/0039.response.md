In the given initial state, the variables `t` and `n` are defined, but the `print` statement does not use these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `t` and `n`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 48.
2. The variable `n` is an input integer.
3. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which directly outputs the string 'NO'.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t` or `n`, the output will always be 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
