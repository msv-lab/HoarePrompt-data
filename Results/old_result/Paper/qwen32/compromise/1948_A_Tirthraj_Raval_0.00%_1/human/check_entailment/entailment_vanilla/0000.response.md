Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in it. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The solution must handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`.

### Key Observations

1. **Special Character Definition:** A character is special if it has exactly one neighbor that is the same as itself. For example, in the string "AAABAACC":
   - 'A' at position 1 is special because it is equal to its right neighbor.
   - 'A' at position 3 is special because it is equal to its left neighbor.
   - 'B' at position 4 is special because it is equal to its right neighbor.
   - 'A' at position 5 is special because it is equal to its left neighbor.
   - 'A' at position 6 is special because it is equal to its right neighbor.
   - 'C' at position 7 is special because it is equal to its right neighbor.
   - 'C' at position 8 is special because it is equal to its left neighbor.

2. **Pattern Requirement:** For a string to have exactly `n` special characters, the pattern must be constructed such that each special character meets the requirement of having exactly one neighbor that is the same.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to construct the string as follows:
- **Odd `n` Case:** If `n` is odd, the solution prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must have exactly one neighbor that is the same.
- **Even `n` Case:** If `n` is even, the solution constructs a string by alternating between 'A' and 'B' pairs. For `n` special characters, it creates `n // 2` pairs of 'A' and 'B' characters, ensuring that each pair contributes exactly 2 special characters.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   3
   6
   1
   2
   ```

2. **Output:**
   - For `n = 6` (even):
     - The solution prints "YES" and constructs the string "ABABAB".
     - The special characters are: 'A' at positions 1 and 2, 'B' at positions 2 and 3, 'A' at positions 3 and 4, 'B' at positions 4 and 5, 'A' at positions 5 and 6, 'B' at positions 6.
     - Total special characters: 6.
   - For `n = 1` (odd):
     - The solution prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly 1 special character.
   - For `n = 2` (even):
     - The solution prints "YES" and constructs the string "AB".
     - The special characters are: 'A' at position 1, 'B' at position 2.
     - Total special characters: 2.

### Conclusion

The solution correctly handles both odd and even cases for `n` and constructs a valid string when `n` is even. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
