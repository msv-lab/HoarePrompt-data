The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of `t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`, and `i` is 1.**
