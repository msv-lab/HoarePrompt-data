To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand the condition under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. We need to find the maximum value of `i` that satisfies this condition.

Given the states after the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `i` becomes 1, which means `2 ** (1 + 1) = 4` must be less than or equal to `x + 1`.
- After 2 iterations: `i` becomes 2, which means `2 ** (2 + 1) = 8` must be less than or equal to `x + 1`.
- After 3 iterations: `i` becomes 3, which means `2 ** (3 + 1) = 16` must be less than or equal to `x + 1`.

The loop will terminate when `2 ** (i + 1)` exceeds `x + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the largest integer such that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

To find the final state, we need to determine the maximum value of `i` that satisfies this condition. This can be done by finding the largest integer `i` such that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. The value of `i` will be `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`.

Let's denote the final value of `i` as `i_final`. The final output state will be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `X` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.
- `subseq_lens` remains an empty list.
- `mx` is updated to `max(mx, i_final)`.
- `i` is updated to `i_final`.

The final output state can be described as:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is max(`mx`, `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`), and `i` is `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will execute until `2 ** (i + 1)` exceeds `x + 1`, and the final value of `i` will be the largest integer such that `2 ** (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. The variable `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the final value of `i`.
