To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

The `while` loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute again, the value of `2 ** (i + 1)` must be less than or equal to `x + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is increased by 1, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` satisfies the loop condition.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. After the increment, `i` is now `i_prev + 1`. For the loop to execute again, the following must hold true:

\[ 2 ** ((i_{prev} + 1) + 1) \leq x + 1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2 ** (i_{prev} + 2) \leq x + 1 \]

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be adjusted such that the inequality holds.

State: **`i` is increased by 1, `x` must be such that \(2 ** (i + 1) \leq x + 1\)**
