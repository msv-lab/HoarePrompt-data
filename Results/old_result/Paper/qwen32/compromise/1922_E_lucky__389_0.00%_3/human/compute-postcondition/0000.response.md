The code snippet `x = int(input())` assigns the value of `x` to be the integer value of the input provided. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. The variable `x` is assigned a new value from the input, but `t` and `X` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, and `x` is the integer value of the input provided.**
