Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`, and `i` is `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`. If `i` is 0, the current value of `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2^(i)`, and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
