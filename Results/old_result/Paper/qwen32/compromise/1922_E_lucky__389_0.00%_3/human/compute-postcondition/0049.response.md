The code snippet `x -= 2 ** i - 1` reduces the value of `x` by `2 ** i - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) <= X + 1`, and `X` is an integer such that `2 <= X <= 10^18`. After the operation, the value of `x` will be updated.

The values of `t`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged because the operation only affects `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and the largest integer i such that 2^(i + 1) <= x + 1, and `i` is the largest integer such that 2^(i + 1) <= x + 1. Additionally, `x` is now `X - (2 ** i - 1)`.**
