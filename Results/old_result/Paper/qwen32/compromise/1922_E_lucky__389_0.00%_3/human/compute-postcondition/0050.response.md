The code snippet `mx = max(mx, i)` updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `X`, `subseq_lens`, and `x` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`, and `i` is the largest integer such that 2^(i + 1) <= x + 1. Additionally, `x` is now `X - (2`**
