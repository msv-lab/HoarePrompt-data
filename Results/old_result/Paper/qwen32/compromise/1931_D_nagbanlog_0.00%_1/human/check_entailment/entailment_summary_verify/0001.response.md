Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) such that:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)
   - This translates to:
     - \((a_i + a_j) \% x == 0\)
     - \((a_i - a_j) \% y == 0\)

2. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - Let \(a_i \% x = r_i\) and \(a_j \% x = r_j\). The condition \((a_i + a_j) \% x == 0\) implies \(r_i + r_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(r_j \equiv -r_i \pmod{x}\).
   - Similarly, let \(a_i \% y = s_i\) and \(a_j \% y = s_j\). The condition \((a_i - a_j) \% y == 0\) implies \(s_i \equiv s_j \pmod{y}\).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - For each element in the array, compute its remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - Use a dictionary `freq` to keep track of how many times each pair of remainders \((r_i, s_i)\) has been seen.
   - For each element, compute the required remainders \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) such that a previous element with these remainders would form a beautiful pair with the current element.
   - If such a pair exists in the dictionary, increment the count of beautiful pairs.
   - Update the frequency dictionary with the current element's remainders.

### Implementation Details:
- The code initializes a dictionary `freq` to store the counts of remainder pairs.
- For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders and checks if they exist in the dictionary.
- If they do, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
- Finally, it updates the dictionary with the current element's remainders.

### Code Review:
- The code calculates `mod_x` as `num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
- The `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which is correct for finding the complement remainder that sums to zero modulo \(x\).
- The `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`, which is correct because we need the same remainder modulo \(y\).
- The code checks if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the dictionary `freq` and increments `beautiful_count` accordingly.
- The code then updates the dictionary `freq` with the current element's remainders.

### Function Summary:
- The function summary suggests that there is a logical error causing the function to always append zero to the `results` list. However, this does not align with the provided code logic.

### Conclusion:
Upon careful analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs. There is no logical error in the code that would cause it to always append zero to the `results` list. The code correctly calculates the required remainders, checks for existing pairs in the dictionary, and updates the dictionary with the current element's remainders.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
