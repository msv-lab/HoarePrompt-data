Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - For a pair \((a_i, a_j)\), this translates to:
     - \((a_i + a_j) \% x == 0\)
     - \((a_i - a_j) \% y == 0\)

2. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - Let \(a_i \% x = r_i\) and \(a_j \% x = r_j\). The condition \((a_i + a_j) \% x == 0\) implies \(r_i + r_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(r_j \equiv -r_i \pmod{x}\).
   - Similarly, let \(a_i \% y = s_i\) and \(a_j \% y = s_j\). The condition \((a_i - a_j) \% y == 0\) implies \(s_i \equiv s_j \pmod{y}\).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - For each element in the array, compute its remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - Use a dictionary `freq` to keep track of how many times each pair of remainders \((r_i, s_i)\) has been seen.
   - For each element, compute the required remainders \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) such that a previous element with these remainders would form a beautiful pair with the current element.
   - If such a pair exists in the dictionary, increment the count of beautiful pairs.
   - Update the frequency dictionary with the current element's remainders.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program correctly computes the remainders and checks for the required pairs.
   - It uses a dictionary to efficiently count and check pairs, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Checking the Code:
- The code initializes a dictionary `freq` to store the counts of remainder pairs.
- For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders and checks if they exist in the dictionary.
- If they do, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
- Finally, it updates the dictionary with the current element's remainders.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem statement. The use of dictionaries ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
