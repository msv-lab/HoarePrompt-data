#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a list of n integers a where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']

        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0

    #State: results is [0, 0, ..., 0] (with t zeros)
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' containing t zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates a "beautiful count" based on specific modular conditions and appends this count to the `results` list. However, due to a logical error in the code, the function incorrectly always appends zero to the `results` list, resulting in a final output of a list containing `t` zeros.
