Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])], `results` is [0], `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is [4, 5, 6], `case` is (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6]), `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 6, `freq[(4, 6)]` is 0, and `(mod_x, mod_y)` is now in `freq`. `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The dictionary `freq` now contains the key `(4, 6)` with the value `0`. All other variables retain their initial values.
