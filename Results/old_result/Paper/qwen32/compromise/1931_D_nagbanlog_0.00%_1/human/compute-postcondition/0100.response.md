To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state provided:

- `num`: This variable is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since it is used in the print statement but not defined, we can assume it might be a typo or missing from the initial state. For the sake of this exercise, we'll assume it should be one of the variables already defined, such as `n`, `x`, `y`, or another relevant variable. However, since `num` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value. For clarity, let's assume it was intended to be `n` (as it's the only integer variable that fits logically in this context).

Given this assumption:
- `n` is 4
- `mod_x` is 4
- `mod_y` is 6
- `required_mod_x` is 2
- `required_mod_y` is 6

Let's substitute these values into the print statement:

```python
print(
    f'Number: {n}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

Substituting the values:
- `Number: 4`
- `mod_x: 4`
- `mod_y: 6`
- `required_mod_x: 2`
- `required_mod_y: 6`

Thus, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **Number: 4, mod_x: 4, mod_y: 6, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 6**
