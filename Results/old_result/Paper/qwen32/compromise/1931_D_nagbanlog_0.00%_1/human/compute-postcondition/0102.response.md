Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `beautiful_count` is `freq[(2, 6)]`, `freq` contains the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`, `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 6`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `beautiful_count` is updated to the value stored in `freq` under the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`, which is `(2, 6)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
