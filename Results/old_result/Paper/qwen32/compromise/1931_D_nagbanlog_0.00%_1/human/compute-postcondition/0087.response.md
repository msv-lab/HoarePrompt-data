The code snippet provided is:

```python
print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
```

From the initial state, we know that `beautiful_count` is explicitly set to 0.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string "Beautiful pairs count: " followed by the value of `beautiful_count`, which is 0.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: 0**
