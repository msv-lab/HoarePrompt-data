Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `freq` contains the key `(4, 6)` with the value `1` and the key `(4, 4)` with the value `1`, `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 4, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 4, `num` is 4`.**

The value of `freq[(4, 4)]` was initially `0` and has been incremented by `1`, making it `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
