The given code snippet attempts to unpack values from a dictionary named `case` into the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. However, there is no `case` dictionary defined in the initial state. Assuming that the intention was to use the first element of the `test_cases` list, we can proceed with that assumption.

Given the initial state, let's assume `case` is the first element of `test_cases`, which is `(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])`. Since the tuple has four elements, but only three are being unpacked, the fourth element `[1, 2, 3]` will be ignored in this unpacking operation.

Here's the updated state after the code execution:

- `n` will be assigned the value `3`.
- `x` will be assigned the value `5`.
- `y` will be assigned the value `7`.

The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7**.
