The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value stored in `freq` at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. Given that `required_mod_x` is 2 and `required_mod_y` is 5, the value added to `beautiful_count` is `freq[(2, 5)]`.

Since the exact value of `freq[(2, 5)]` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `beautiful_count` after the operation. However, we know that `beautiful_count` will be its previous value plus `freq[(2, 5)]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `freq` contains the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` which is `(2, 5)`, `beautiful_count` is `beautiful_count + freq[(2, 5)]`, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 5, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 5**.
