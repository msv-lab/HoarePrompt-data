Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 6, `freq` is `{(4, 6): 1}`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, the state of the variables remains as described above. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.**
