To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, we need to focus on the line:

```python
mod_y = num % y
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `y` is 8.
- `num` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but since `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, and typically such tuples contain related values, we can infer that `num` might be one of the values from the tuple, specifically the fourth element `[4, 5, 6]`. However, without explicit assignment, we'll assume `num` is the last element of the tuple `case`, which is 6.

Given these assumptions:
- `num` is 6.
- `y` is 8.

Thus, `mod_y` will be calculated as `6 % 8`, which equals 6.

Therefore, the updated state will be:
- `mod_y` is 6.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])], `results` is [0], `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is [4, 5, 6], `case` is (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6]), `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 6, `freq` is {(4, 6): 1}, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged**.
