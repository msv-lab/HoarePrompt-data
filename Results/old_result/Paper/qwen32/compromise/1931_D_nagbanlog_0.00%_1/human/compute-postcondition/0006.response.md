Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

- `t` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]` (though this variable is also not used in the print statement).
- `results` is an empty list (not used in the print statement).
- `n` is 3.
- `x` is 5.
- `y` is 7.
- `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary (not used in the print statement).
- `beautiful_count` is 0 (not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

We need to substitute the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` into the formatted string.

- `n` is 3.
- `x` is 5.
- `y` is 7.
- `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`.

So, the string will be formatted as:
```
Processing Test Case: n = 3, x = 5, y = 7, array = [1, 2, 3]
```

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = 3, x = 5, y = 7, array = [1, 2, 3]**
