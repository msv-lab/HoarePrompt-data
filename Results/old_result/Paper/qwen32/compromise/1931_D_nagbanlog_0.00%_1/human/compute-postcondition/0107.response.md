The code increments the value associated with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq`. Given that `mod_x` is 4 and `mod_y` is 6, the key `(4, 6)` already exists in `freq` with a value of 0. After executing the code, the value associated with the key `(4, 6)` in `freq` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `freq` contains the key `(4, 6)` with the value `1`, `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 6`.**
