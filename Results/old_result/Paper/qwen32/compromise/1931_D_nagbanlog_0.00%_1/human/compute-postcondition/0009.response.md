The code snippet `mod_y = num % y` assigns the value of `num % y` to the variable `mod_y`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state. Since `num` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact value of `mod_y`. Assuming `num` is intended to be one of the predefined variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, etc.), let's consider each possibility:

1. If `num` were `t`, then `mod_y = t % y = 1 % 7 = 1`.
2. If `num` were `n`, then `mod_y = n % y = 3 % 7 = 3`.
3. If `num` were `x`, then `mod_y = x % y = 5 % 7 = 5`.
4. If `num` were `y`, then `mod_y = y % y = 7 % 7 = 0`.
5. If `num` were `mod_x`, then `mod_y = mod_x % y = 3 % 7 = 3`.

Since `num` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `mod_y`. However, if we assume `num` is meant to be `x` (as it is a common variable in such contexts), then `mod_y` would be `5`.

Given this assumption, the Output State would be:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `freq` is `{}`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 5`.**
