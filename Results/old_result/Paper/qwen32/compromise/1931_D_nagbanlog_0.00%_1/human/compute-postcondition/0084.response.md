Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `mod_x` is 5, `mod_y` is 5, `required_mod_x` is 1, `required_mod_y` is 5`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `num` is 5`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq` is updated to include `(5, 5): 0`. Otherwise, `freq` remains unchanged.**
