Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. `n` remains unchanged as the input integer. `l` remains unchanged as the input list of integers. `i` will be `n` after the loop finishes. `j` is 0, indicating that the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` was not met at any point during the loop.**
