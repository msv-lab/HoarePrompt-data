The value of `i` is explicitly set to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `j`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0 indicating that the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never met for any `i`.**
