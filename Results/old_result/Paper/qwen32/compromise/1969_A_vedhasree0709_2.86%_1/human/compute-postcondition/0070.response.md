The `print(2)` statement in the given code snippet will simply print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j`. The value `2` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
2. `n` is at least 2.
3. `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
4. `i` is initialized to 1.
5. `j` is set to 1 if `l[0]` is 2 and `l[1]` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.

None of these variables affect the `print(2)` statement because it directly prints the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
