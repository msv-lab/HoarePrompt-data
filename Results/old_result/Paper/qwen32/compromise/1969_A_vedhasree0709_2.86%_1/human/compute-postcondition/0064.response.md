The `print(2)` statement will simply print the integer value `2`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the constant value provided in the `print` function.

Output: **2**
