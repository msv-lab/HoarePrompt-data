Output State: **`t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
