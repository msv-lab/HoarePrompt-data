To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `i <= n - 1` is satisfied. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 so that `i <= n - 1` holds true (since 0 <= 1 - 1 is false, but 0 <= 2 - 1 is true).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. The initial value of `i` is 0.
3. For the loop to execute, `0 <= n - 1` must be true.
4. This inequality simplifies to `n >= 1`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n`, which must be at least 1. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `i`, `j`) do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
