The only variable in the loop head of the given `while` loop is `i`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted such that the condition `i <= n - 1` holds true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is 1
- The conditions related to `j` do not affect the loop head and can be ignored for the purpose of this task

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 (so that `n - 1` is at least 1, which satisfies `1 <= n - 1`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1**
