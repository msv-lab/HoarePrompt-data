The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `j` if it was set) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 2; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is 2. If `l[2]` equals `4` and `l[3]` equals `3`, then `j` is set to 1.
