n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (same scenario). The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. At most floor(n/2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.
