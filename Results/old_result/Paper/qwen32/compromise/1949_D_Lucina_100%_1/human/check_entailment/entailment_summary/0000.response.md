### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by assigning 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters in the grid based on certain rules. However, there are several issues with the program's approach:

1. **Counting Logic**: The program counts the number of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario (node) and then tries to balance the remaining '?' based on these counts. However, it does not correctly handle the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type should be seen in any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Assignment Logic**: The program assigns 'F' or 'S' based on whether the node is in the `sa` or `sb` list, which contains nodes with only 'F' or only 'S' transitions, respectively. It then assigns 'F' or 'S' to the remaining '?' based on the position of the node in the list. This logic does not ensure that the maximum consecutive videos of the same type constraint is met.

3. **Handling of Undecided Transitions**: The program does not properly handle the assignment of '?' transitions to ensure that the constraints are met for all permutations. It simply tries to balance the counts without considering the sequence of videos.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the initial 'F' and 'S' transitions are already close to the maximum allowed consecutive count. It does not ensure that the assignment of '?' transitions will not violate the constraints.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not guarantee that the output will always satisfy the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
