Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24; The input consists of `n` lines, where each line contains `n` characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (same scenario). The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. At most floor(`n`/2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**

In simpler terms, the variable `b` has been initialized as a list of `n + 1` zeros, while the other variables remain unchanged.
