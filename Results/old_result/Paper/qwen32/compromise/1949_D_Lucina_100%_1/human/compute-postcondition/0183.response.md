Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**

Explanation: The string `nx` was initially an empty string and now it is 'S'. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
