The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `b` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, the value at index 3 of the list `b` is incremented by 1. The variables `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 3, and the value at index 3 in list `b` is incremented by 1.**
