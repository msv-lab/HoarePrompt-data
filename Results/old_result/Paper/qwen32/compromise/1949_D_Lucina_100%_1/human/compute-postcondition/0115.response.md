To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column.
- `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column.
- `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input.
- `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally the current index `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.
- `t` is the length of `sa`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value between 1 and `n`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `t`, and `n`) do not change in the loop head and thus remain the same.

State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally the current index `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the previous `i` value plus 1**.
