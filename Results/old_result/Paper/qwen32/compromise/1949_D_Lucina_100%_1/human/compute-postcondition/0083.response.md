The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 6, `b[6]` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`x` is the new input string, `a` and `b` are lists dependent on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the new `x` from positions `k-1` to `n-1`, `xx` has the old value of `x` appended to it, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 6, `b[4]` is incremented by 1, `b[6]` is incremented by 1.**
