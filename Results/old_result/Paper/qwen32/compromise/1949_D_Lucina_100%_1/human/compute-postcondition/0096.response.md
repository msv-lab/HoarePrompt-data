The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Given the initial state, `sb` was an empty list. After executing this line, `sb` will contain the single element `i`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `n`) are not modified by this code snippet, so they retain their initial values and states.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing the current index `i` if `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, otherwise `sa` remains empty, `sb` is a list containing the single element `i`, and `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0.**
