The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, this means `a[2]` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` and the values of other elements in `a` (except `a[2]`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[i] + 1` except `a[2]` which is `a[2] + 2`.**
