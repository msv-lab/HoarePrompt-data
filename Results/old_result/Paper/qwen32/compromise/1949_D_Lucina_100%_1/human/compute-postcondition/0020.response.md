Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is 1 and `a[j]` is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `b[1]` which is 3 if `x[0]` is 'S' and `b[2]` is 1, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the value of the user's input, `j` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b[2]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
