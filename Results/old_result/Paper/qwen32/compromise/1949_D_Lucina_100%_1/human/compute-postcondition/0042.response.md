Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 1, and the element at index `j - 1` in the list `x` is not 'F'. If the element at index `j - 1` in the list `x` is 'S', then the element at index `i` in the list `b` is incremented by 1 and the element at index `j` in the list `b` is incremented by 1.**
