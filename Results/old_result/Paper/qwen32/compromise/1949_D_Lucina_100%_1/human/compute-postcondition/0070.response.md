Postcondition: **`x` is the new input string, `a` and `b` are lists dependent on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the new `x` from positions `k-1` to `n-1`, `xx` has the old value of `x` appended to it, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `x[j - 1]` is not 'F'. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[4]` is incremented by 2.**
