To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the construction of the `nx` string.

Here is the provided initial state:
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column.
- `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column.
- `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input.
- `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.
- `t` is the length of `sa`.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `nx` is a string of length `n` built based on the characters from `xx[i]` and the conditions involving `sa`.

The exact construction of the `nx` string is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer its construction based on the given conditions and the context provided.

Given the initial state, we can deduce the following:
- `xx` contains `n + 1` elements, where the first element is an empty string and the remaining `n` elements are the lines of input.
- `sa` contains indices where either there are 'F' characters but no 'S' characters, or there are no 'F' characters and no 'S' characters in the corresponding columns.
- `sb` contains indices where there are 'S' characters but no 'F' characters in the corresponding columns.

The `nx` string is built based on the characters from `xx[i]` and the conditions involving `sa`. However, since the exact construction of `nx` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the conditions given.

Let's assume that the construction of `nx` involves iterating through the indices in `sa` and possibly `sb` and selecting characters from the corresponding lines in `xx`.

Given the lack of explicit details on how `nx` is constructed, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n constructed based on the characters from xx[i] and the conditions involving sa)**

Since the exact construction of `nx` is not specified, we provide a general description of what `nx` is based on the given conditions.
