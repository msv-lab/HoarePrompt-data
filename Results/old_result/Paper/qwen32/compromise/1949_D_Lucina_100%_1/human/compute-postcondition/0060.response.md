The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is a list where `a[k]` is the count of 'F' in positions `k-1` to `n-1` of `x`, and `b` is a list where `b[k]` is the count of 'S' in positions `k-1` to `n-1` of `x`. `xx` has `x` appended to it. `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
