Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `nx` is 'S', `i` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.**

Natural Language: The variable `nx` has been updated to contain the string 'S'. All other variables retain their initial values.
