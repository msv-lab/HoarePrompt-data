The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide information about the list `a` or the index `i`. Given the information, we can only infer that the value at `a[i]` has been increased by 1.

Since `n` and `j` are not affected by the code snippet, they retain their initial values. The specific value of `a[i]` after the operation is `a[i] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[i] + 1`.**
