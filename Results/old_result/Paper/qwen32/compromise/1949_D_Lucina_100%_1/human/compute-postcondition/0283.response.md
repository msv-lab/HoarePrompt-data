To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration).
- The condition for the loop is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`.

From the loop statement, we know that `j` is the loop variable and it ranges from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the start of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the new value of `j`:** Since `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Check the loop condition:** The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `j` is `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that `k + 1 <= n`. This means `j` must be `k + 1` and `n` must be such that `j <= n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration)**

Since `j` is incremented by 1 and `n` is unchanged, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**
