The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The other variables, `i`, `n`, and `j`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nx` is a string with 'S' appended to its previous value, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration.**
