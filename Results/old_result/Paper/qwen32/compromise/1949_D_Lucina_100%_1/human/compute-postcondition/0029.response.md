Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is 1, and `a[2]` is incremented by 1 if `x[1]` is 'F'. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[3]` is 1. `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `b[1]` which is 2 if `x[0]` is 'S', or 1 if `x[0]` is not 'S', and `b[2]` is set to 1 if `x[1]` is 'S', incrementing it from its initial value of 2 to 3 if `x[0]` is 'S'. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[3]` is incremented by 1. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the value of the user's input, `j` is 3.**
