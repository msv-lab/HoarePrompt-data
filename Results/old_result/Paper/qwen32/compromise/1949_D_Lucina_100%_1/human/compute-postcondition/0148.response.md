The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n + 1`, which means the loop has just finished executing.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be within the valid range of the loop, which is from 1 to `n`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we should set `i` to 1 at the start of the next iteration to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is a string of length `n` built based on the characters from `xx[i]` and the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is 1**
