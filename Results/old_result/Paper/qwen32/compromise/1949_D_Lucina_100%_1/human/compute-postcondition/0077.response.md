Postcondition: **`x` is the new input string, `a` and `b` are lists dependent on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the new `x` from positions `k-1` to `n-1`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[4]` and `a[j]` are incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[4]` is incremented by 2. `xx` has the old value of `x` appended to it, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[4]` is incremented by 1 and `b[5]` is incremented by 1.**
