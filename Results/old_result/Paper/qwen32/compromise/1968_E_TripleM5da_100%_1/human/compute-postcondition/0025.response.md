The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the values `1` and `2`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
2. The variable `n` is an integer value provided by the user input.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, 2)
```

This statement explicitly prints the integers `1` and `2`, separated by a space.

Output: **1, 2**
