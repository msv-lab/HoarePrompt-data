To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables change over time.

The loop starts with `i = 3` and continues until `i = n + 1`. Each iteration prints the current value of `i` twice. The loop executes for `n - 2` iterations, because it starts at 3 and ends at `n`.

Given the initial state and the conditions after the first 3 iterations, we can see that `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and `i` increments from 3 up to `n + 1`. At the end of the loop, `i` will be `n + 1`.

Here's the final output state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is an integer such that i = n + 1.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n + 1`, while `t` and `n` will retain their initial values.
