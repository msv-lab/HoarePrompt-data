The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, starting from `i = 3`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4. The value of `n` must remain such that `i` is still within the range, i.e., `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again with `i = 4`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4**
