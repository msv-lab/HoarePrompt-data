To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `k >= 1 << idx` is satisfied. Given the initial state, `idx` is 0, so the condition simplifies to `k >= 1 << 0`, which is `k >= 1`.

Let's break down the variables involved in the loop head:
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `idx` is 0 (given in the initial state).

Since `idx` is fixed at 0, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop condition is met is `k`. Therefore, `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 0**
