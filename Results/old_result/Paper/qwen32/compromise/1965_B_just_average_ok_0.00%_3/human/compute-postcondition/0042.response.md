The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be at least 1, and `idx` is 1. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need `k` to be greater than or equal to `1 << idx`. Since `idx` is 1, `1 << idx` is 2. Therefore, `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 1**
