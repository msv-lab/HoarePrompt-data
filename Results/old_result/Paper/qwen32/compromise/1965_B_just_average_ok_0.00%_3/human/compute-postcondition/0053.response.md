To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `nums` is a list constructed as follows:
     - Start with the list \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
     - Add \(k - \text{nums[idx]}\) to the list.
     - Add \(k + 1\) to the list.
     - Add \(k + \text{nums[idx]} + 1\) to the list.
     - Remove the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from the list.
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\) minus 1.

2. **Determine `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\).
   - This means \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\) and \(k \geq 2^{\text{idx}-1}\).
   - Therefore, `idx` is the position where \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is just greater than `k`.

3. **Construct `nums`:**
   - Start with the predefined list of powers of 2.
   - Identify \(2^{\text{idx}}\) in the list.
   - Remove \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from the list.
   - Add \(k - 2^{\text{idx-1}}\) to the list.
   - Add \(k + 1\) to the list.
   - Add \(k + 2^{\text{idx-1}} + 1\) to the list.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `k` is 10.
   - The smallest power of 2 greater than 10 is 16, so \(2^{\text{idx}} = 16\) and `idx` is 4.
   - Remove 16 from the list.
   - Add \(10 - 8 = 2\) to the list.
   - Add \(10 + 1 = 11\) to the list.
   - Add \(10 + 8 + 1 = 19\) to the list.

5. **Final List Construction:**
   - The initial list is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
   - Remove 16.
   - Add 2, 11, and 19.
   - The final list is \([1, 2, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 11, 19]\).

6. **Output:**
   - The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the final list `nums`.

Output: **1, 2, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 11, 19** (where the list is constructed based on the value of `k` as described above)
