To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(nums))` statement, we need to carefully examine the initial state provided and understand the composition of the `nums` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `nums` is a list of integers explicitly defined as `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 8388608, k - 4194304, k + 1, 2k - 4194303]`.
   - `idx` is 22.

2. **List `nums` Composition:**
   - The list `nums` contains 25 integers.
   - The first 23 integers are powers of 2, starting from \(2^0\) to \(2^{22}\).
   - The remaining two integers are `k - 4194304` and `k + 1`, followed by `2k - 4194303`.

3. **Counting the Elements:**
   - The list `nums` has a fixed number of elements regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.
   - Specifically, `nums` has 25 elements.

### Conclusion:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will output the number of elements in the `nums` list, which is 25.

Output: **25**
