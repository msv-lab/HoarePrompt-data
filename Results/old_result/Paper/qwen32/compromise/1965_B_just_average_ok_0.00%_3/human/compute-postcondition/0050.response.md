To solve this, we need to understand how the `nums` list and `idx` are defined and how the new element is being appended to `nums`.

Given:
- `nums` is a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\), followed by \(k - nums[idx]\) and \(k + 1\).
- `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\).

The operation to be performed:
- Append `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the `nums` list.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Determine `idx` based on the value of `k`.
2. The new element to be appended is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we'll keep `k` and `idx` in the output state.

For example, if `k` is 10, then `idx` would be 4 because \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\), and 10 is less than 16 but greater than or equal to 8.
The new element to be appended would be `10 + nums[4] + 1 = 10 + 16 + 1 = 27`.

However, since `k` is not specified, we will keep the expression `k + nums[idx] + 1` in the output state.

The output state will be:
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer from the input.
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `nums` now includes the new element `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- `idx` remains the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\).

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**
