To determine the output state, we need to understand how the code impacts the variables given the initial state. The code provided is `nums.remove(1 << idx)`. Here, `1 << idx` is equivalent to \(2^{\text{idx}}\). The `nums` list contains specific values, and the `remove` method will remove the first occurrence of \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from the list.

Given that `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1, the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than `k`.

Let's break down the impact:
1. The `nums` list will have \(2^{\text{idx}}\) removed from it.
2. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]\) with \(2^{\text{idx}}\) removed, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**

In natural language: The value of `2^idx` has been removed from the `nums` list, while `n`, `k`, `t`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
