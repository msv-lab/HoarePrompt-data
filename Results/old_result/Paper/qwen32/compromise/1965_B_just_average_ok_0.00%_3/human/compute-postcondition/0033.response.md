The code removes the element at index `idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 26, the element at this index is `k - 8388608`. After the removal, `nums` will no longer contain this element.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k + 1, 2k + 2]\), `idx` is 26.**
