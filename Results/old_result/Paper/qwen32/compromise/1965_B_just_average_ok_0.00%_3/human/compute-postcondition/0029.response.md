The value of `idx` is decremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `idx` is 27, after the operation `idx -= 1`, the value of `idx` becomes 26. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, and `nums`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), nums is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), idx is 26.**
