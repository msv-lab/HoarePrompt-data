To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether it meets the problem requirements for every possible valid input. The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers that satisfies two conditions:

1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to `k`.
2. For all values `v` from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`), there is at least one subsequence of the sequence that sums to `v`.

Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets these requirements.

### Program Analysis

The program works as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to `2^23` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 8388608]`).
3. It finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
4. It modifies the list by removing this power of 2 and adding three new elements:
   - `k - nums[idx]`
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1`
5. It prints the length of the modified list and the elements of the list.

### Verification of Conditions

Let's verify if the generated sequence satisfies the conditions:

1. **No subsequence sums to `k`**:
   - The sequence initially contains powers of 2, which do not sum to `k` unless `k` itself is a power of 2.
   - The power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` is removed.
   - The new elements added are `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. None of these can sum to `k` because:
     - `k - nums[idx]` is less than `k`.
     - `k + 1` is greater than `k`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1` is greater than `k`.

2. **Subsequences sum to all values from `1` to `n` except `k`**:
   - The initial sequence `[1, 2, 4, ..., 8388608]` can generate all sums that are powers of 2 or sums of distinct powers of 2.
   - The removal of one power of 2 and the addition of the new elements ensures that all sums can still be formed except for `k`.
   - The new elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensure that the sequence can cover all values up to `n` except `k`.

### Conclusion

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
