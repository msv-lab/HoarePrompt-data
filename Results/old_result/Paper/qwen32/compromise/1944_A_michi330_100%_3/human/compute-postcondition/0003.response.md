The function `func` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` for each test case, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}`. There are `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`. The function processes each test case independently.

For each test case:
- If `k` is within the valid range `0 ≤ k ≤ \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}`, the function performs some computation (not detailed here) and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.
- If `k` is not within the valid range, the behavior is not specified in the given constraints, so we assume it does not occur given the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` for each of `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}`, and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
