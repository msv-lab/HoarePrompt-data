Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**: Initially, there are `n` islands, and every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. This means there are \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) bridges.
2. **Dominater's Action**: Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges.
3. **Everule's Goal**: Everule wants to visit as many islands as possible starting from island 1.
4. **Dominater's Goal**: Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit by destroying up to `k` bridges.

### Key Insight:
- To minimize the number of islands Everule can visit, Dominater should aim to isolate island 1 from as many other islands as possible.
- If Dominater destroys `n-1` bridges, island 1 will be isolated from all other islands, meaning Everule can only visit island 1.
- If Dominater destroys fewer than `n-1` bridges, there will still be a path from island 1 to some other islands, meaning Everule can visit more than just island 1.

### Conclusion:
- If `k >= n-1`, Dominater can isolate island 1, so Everule can only visit island 1. Therefore, the output should be 1.
- If `k < n-1`, Dominater cannot completely isolate island 1, so Everule can still visit all `n` islands. Therefore, the output should be `n`.

### Code Analysis:
The code correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- If `k >= n-1`, it prints 1.
- Otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the described logic.

Correctness: **True**
