Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. 

The key observation is:
- If `n` is at least `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if `n - m` is even. This is because we can add `m` cubes and then, if necessary, add and remove pairs of cubes (`n - m` times) to make the total number of moves `n`.
- If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.

Now, let's look at the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line doesn't affect the logic and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Let's break down the logic in the program:
- The first `if` condition checks if `b == c`. This is correct because if the number of moves `n` is equal to the number of cubes `m`, it's always possible to end up with `m` cubes.
- The second `elif` condition checks if `b < c`. This is also correct because if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes.
- The third `elif` condition checks if `a % 2 == b % 2`. This condition is incorrect. It should check if `(b - c) % 2 == 0` instead of `a % 2 == b % 2` to determine if `n - m` is even.
- The `else` condition is correct in the sense that it covers the remaining cases, but it is not necessary if the third condition is corrected.

Given the analysis, the third condition is incorrect, which means the program does not always provide the correct answer.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
