To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop runs as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. In each iteration, the following happens:
- If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the loop prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks.
- Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is decremented by 1.

The loop will terminate either by breaking out of the loop when the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, or by the condition `y < x` being met, which causes the `else` clause of the `while` loop to execute, printing `p3`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the following:
- After 1 iteration, `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` is `p3` or `p3 - 1`.
- After 2 iterations, `x` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `y` is `p3`, `p3 - 1`, or `p3 - 2`.
- After 3 iterations, `x` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `y` is `p3`, `p3 - 1`, `p3 - 2`, or `p3 - 3`.

The loop will continue until `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, or `y` becomes less than `x`. The final state of `x` and `y` will depend on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

If the loop terminates by the condition `y < x`, then `x` will be one more than `y` at the end of the loop, and the final output will be `p3`.

If the loop terminates by the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then the final output will be `p1 - x + p3`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can only describe the final state in terms of the conditions that lead to termination.

The final state of the loop will be that `x` and `y` have values such that either `p1 - x <= p2 - y` (and the output is `p1 - x + p3`), or `y < x` (and the output is `p3`).

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the most general final output state can be described as:

Output State: **The loop terminates either by printing `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, or by printing `p3` if `y < x` is met.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that the loop will print a value, which is either `p3` or `p1 - x + p3` depending on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
