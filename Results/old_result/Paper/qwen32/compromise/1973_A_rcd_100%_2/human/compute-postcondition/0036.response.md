Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499.
2. `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program does not perform any additional actions.
5. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the loop terminates either by printing `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, or by printing `p3` if `y` is less than `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs `-1`. This statement is independent of the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, as well as the conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print(-1)` statement is executed regardless of the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, the output will always be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
