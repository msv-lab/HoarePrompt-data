Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` must be at least 1. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, `x` remains 0 and `y` is set to `p3`. If `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `p3 - 1`. After the else part, if `x` is 1, `y` remains `p3 - 1`, and if `x` is 2, `y` is set to `p3 - 2`.**
