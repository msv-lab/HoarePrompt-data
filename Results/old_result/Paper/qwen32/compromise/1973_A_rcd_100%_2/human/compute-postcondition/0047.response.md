The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 1; `y` is `p3`; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.
