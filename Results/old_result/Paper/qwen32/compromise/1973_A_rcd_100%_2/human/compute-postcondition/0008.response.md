To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- The current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

The code snippet:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

From the initial state, we know that `p3` ≥ `p1 + p2`. However, the value of `p1 + p2` alone does not depend on `p3` but rather on the values of `p1` and `p2` themselves. The condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd does not directly affect the sum of `p1` and `p2`, but it does provide a constraint on the parity (odd/even nature) of `p1 + p2`.

Since `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, and `p3` is an integer, the parity of `p1 + p2` must be such that when `p3` is added, the total sum becomes odd. This means:
- If `p3` is odd, then `p1 + p2` must be even.
- If `p3` is even, then `p1 + p2` must be odd.

However, the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, so we can't determine a specific numerical value for `p1 + p2`. We only know the constraints on the sum based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which is an integer value satisfying the given constraints.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that p1 + p2 + p3 is odd and p3 ≥ p1 + p2)**
