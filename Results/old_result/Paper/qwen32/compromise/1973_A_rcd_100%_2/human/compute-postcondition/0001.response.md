The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Given that `t` satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not affect the execution of the loop and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500**
