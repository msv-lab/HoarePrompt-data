Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is `p3`.
- `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `x`**: According to the initial state, `x` is 0.
2. **Expression `p1 - x`**: Since `x` is 0, `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1`.
3. **Expression `p1 - x + p3`**: Substituting `p1 - x` with `p1`, the expression becomes `p1 + p3`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `p1 + p3`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers such that the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
