Output State: **`t` is an input integer, each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30. The number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions on `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are part of the precondition for each test case, not directly affected by the given code snippet.
