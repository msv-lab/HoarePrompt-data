Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 0; `y` is `p3`; `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
