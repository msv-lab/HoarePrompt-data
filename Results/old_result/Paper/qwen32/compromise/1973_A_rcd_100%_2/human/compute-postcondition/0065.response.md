The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. However, the initial state already specifies that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, and their sum is odd. This means the code snippet does not change the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` but rather reassigns them based on the same input, which is redundant given the initial state.

Since the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are already defined by the initial state and the code does not alter `t`, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
