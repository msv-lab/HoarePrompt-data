The code snippet provided reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input. This action updates the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` based on the input, but it does not affect the variable `t` or any other variables not mentioned in the snippet. The precondition about the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd and the condition regarding `p3` being greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2` remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program does not perform any additional actions. Otherwise, the loop terminates either by printing `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, or by printing `p3` if `y` is less than `x`.**
