The given code snippet is `continue`. The `continue` statement in a loop skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. However, in the provided context, there is no loop structure, which means the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the flow of the program. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program does not perform any additional actions. Otherwise, the loop terminates either by printing `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, or by printing `p3` if `y` is less than `x`.**
