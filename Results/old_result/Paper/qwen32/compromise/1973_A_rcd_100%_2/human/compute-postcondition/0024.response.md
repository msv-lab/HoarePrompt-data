The code snippet `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Since `y` was previously defined as `p3 - 1`, after the decrement, `y` becomes `p3 - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and `p3` must be at least 2 if `x` is 2; `x` is increased by 1; `y` is `p3 - 2`.**
