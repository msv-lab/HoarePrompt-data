To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from `mdx` to `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is at least 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is at least 1.
- `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user.
- If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer.
- If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(mdx, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value `mdx` and incremented by 1 until it reached a value just before `n`. To continue the loop, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. The state at the start of the next iteration would have `i` as `i_end + 1`.

Since `mdx` and `n` do not change within the loop, they remain the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.
- `mdx` remains `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Since we do not know the exact value of `i_end` from the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (assuming `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration).

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is `i + 1`, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**.
