Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer. If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1 and `i` is `mdx + 1`.**
