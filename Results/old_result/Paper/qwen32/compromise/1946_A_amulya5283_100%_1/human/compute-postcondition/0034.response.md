The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The precondition states that `res` is initially 0 if `n` is not 1. After the increment, `res` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer. If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is 1. The element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`.**
