Output State: **t is 0, n is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, a is the sorted list of integers input by the user in the last iteration, and res is the count of occurrences of a[mdx] from index mdx to n-1 in the list a if n is not 1. If n is 1, res is 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations:
- The variable `t` will be 0 because the loop condition `t > 0` will no longer be true, as `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The variable `n` will hold the value of the integer input by the user in the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `a` will be the sorted list of integers input by the user in the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `res` will be the count of how many times the middle element (or the element just after the middle in case of even `n`) appears in the list `a` from the middle index to the end. If `n` is 1, `res` will simply be 1.
