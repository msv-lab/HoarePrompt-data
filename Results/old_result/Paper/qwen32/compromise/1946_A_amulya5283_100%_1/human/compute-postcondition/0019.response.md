The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `res` is set to 1 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise, the value of `res` is not specified. Since the code increments `res` by 1, if `res` was initially 1, it will now be 2. If `res` was not initially set to 1, it will be incremented by 1 from whatever its initial value was.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user and is not equal to 1, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is set to 2, otherwise, `res` is incremented by 1 from its initial value.**
