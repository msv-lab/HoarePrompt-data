The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, or `res` described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, `res`) and their relationships, but these do not influence the `print(1)` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement explicitly outputs the number `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(1)` statement is:

Output: **1**
