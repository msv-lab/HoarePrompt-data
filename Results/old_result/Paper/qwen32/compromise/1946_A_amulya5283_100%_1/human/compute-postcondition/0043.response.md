Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but the value of `t` is not explicitly given, so we can ignore this for the purpose of determining `res`.
   - `n` is the integer input by the user.
   - `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer.
   - If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `res` is the count of occurrences of the element at index `mdx` in the list `a`.

2. **Determine `mdx`:**
   - If `n` is 1, `mdx` is not calculated because the condition `if n is not 1` is not met. In this case, `a` has only one element, and `res` will be 1 because the only element must occur exactly once.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula effectively finds the middle index of the list `a`:
     - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` is `n // 2 + 1 - 1` which simplifies to `n // 2`. This is the exact middle index.
     - If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` is `n // 2 + 0 - 1` which simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`. This is the lower of the two middle indices.

3. **Determine `res`:**
   - `res` is the count of occurrences of the element at index `mdx` in the list `a`.
   - If `n` is 1, `res` is 1 because there's only one element in the list.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, `res` depends on how many times the element at the middle index (`mdx`) appears in the sorted list `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the count of occurrences of the element at the middle index of the sorted list `a` if `n` is greater than 1, or it will print 1 if `n` is 1.

Given the information, we can summarize the output as follows:

Output: **res (where res is the count of occurrences of the element at index mdx in the sorted list a, and mdx is n // 2 + n % 2 - 1 for n > 1, or 1 for n = 1)**
