The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `flag` to `True`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial state with the addition of the `flag` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from input; `flag` is True**.
