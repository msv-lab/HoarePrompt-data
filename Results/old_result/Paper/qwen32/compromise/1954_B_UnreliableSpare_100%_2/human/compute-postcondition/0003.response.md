The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

The states `t`, `a`, `arr`, and `flag` do not affect whether the loop executes or not, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True**
