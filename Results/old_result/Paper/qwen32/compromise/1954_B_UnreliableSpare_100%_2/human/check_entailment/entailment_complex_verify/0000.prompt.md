You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition.

        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and cnt, and cnt is the count of the final sequence of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to val)
    #State: `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `val`, and `cnt` remain the same. `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`. `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are equal in `arr`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks for the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements and returns that length if the array is not entirely composed of the same element. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, which involves more complex logic.

Let's analyze the provided code and find a potential issue:

1. **Identifying Non-Uniform Arrays:**
   - The code first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because such an array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If the array is not uniform, it attempts to find the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements and returns that value.

2. **Issue with the Logic:**
   - The logic of finding the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements and returning that value is not sufficient to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, which involves identifying the longest sequences that can be reduced by the given operation and then determining the minimum removals required.
   - The provided code does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple sequences of identical elements and the optimal solution involves removing elements from multiple sequences.

3. **Example of Incorrectness:**
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
     - The array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is beautiful because you can choose `i = 2` to replace `arr[2]` with `arr[1]` or `arr[3]`, resulting in `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1]` or `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, and so on.
     - The provided code will output `1` because the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements is `1`. However, the correct answer is `1` because removing any single element (e.g., the `2` at index `1` or `3`) will make the array non-beautiful.
     - However, consider another test case:
       ```
       1
       7
       3 3 3 5 3 3 3
       ```
       - The array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` is beautiful.
       - The provided code will output `3` because the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements is `3`. However, the correct answer is `3` because removing the three `3`s around the `5` will make the array non-beautiful.
       - But if we consider:
         ```
         1
         7
         3 3 3 3 5 3 3 3 3
         ```
         - The array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is beautiful.
         - The provided code will output `4` because the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements is `4`. However, the correct answer is `3` because removing the three `3`s around the `5` will make the array non-beautiful.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly handle all cases and thus is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and hence is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
