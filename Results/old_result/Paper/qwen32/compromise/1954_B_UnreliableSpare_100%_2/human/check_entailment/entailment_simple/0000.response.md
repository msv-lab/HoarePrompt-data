### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initial Check for Uniform Array**:
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it sets `flag` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `flag` is `True` after this check, the program prints `-1` because a uniform array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Finding Minimum Sequence Length**:
   - The program then initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and starts iterating over the array to find the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are equal.
   - It keeps track of the current element (`val`) and the count of consecutive elements (`cnt`).
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `ans` with the count of the last sequence of equal elements.

3. **Output**:
   - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - If `flag` is `False`, the program outputs the minimum length of a sequence of consecutive equal elements (`ans`).

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the array contains sequences of equal elements of length 1 or 2. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements is of length 1, but the program might not correctly identify this as the answer.
- **Logic Flaw**: The program's logic for finding the minimum sequence length is flawed. It should consider all sequences of consecutive equal elements and find the shortest one, but it might not correctly handle cases where the shortest sequence is not at the end of the array.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
