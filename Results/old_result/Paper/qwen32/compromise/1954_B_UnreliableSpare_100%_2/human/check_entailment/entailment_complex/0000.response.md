### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly implements the required solution:

1. **Check if All Elements Are the Same:**
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the previous one.
   - If all elements are the same, it sets `flag` to `True`. Otherwise, `flag` is set to `False`.

2. **Determine the Minimum Length of Consecutive Elements:**
   - The program then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It keeps track of the current element (`val`) and a counter (`cnt`) of how many consecutive elements are equal to `val`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` for the new sequence.
   - After the loop, it performs a final comparison to ensure the last sequence is considered.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` is `True`), it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `ans`, which is the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The program correctly identifies if all elements are the same and outputs `-1` in that case.
  - The logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive elements is flawed. The program only tracks the shortest sequence of a single value (`val`), but it should consider all possible values in the array.
  - For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the shortest sequence of consecutive elements is `5` (which is a single element), but the program would incorrectly compute it as `3` (the length of the sequence of `3`s).

- **Example:**
  - For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program would return `3` instead of `1` (the correct answer, which is the removal of the single `5`).

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the solution as it does not properly account for the shortest sequence of consecutive elements across all possible values in the array.

**Correctness: **False**
