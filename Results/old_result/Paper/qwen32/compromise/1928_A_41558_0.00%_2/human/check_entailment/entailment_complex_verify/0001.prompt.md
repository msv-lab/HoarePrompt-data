You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: A series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each of the n test cases based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one is exactly half of the other; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, he wants to see if he can form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cut Parallel to Sides:**
   - If Bob cuts parallel to the `a` side, he gets two rectangles of size `(a/2) x b` if `a` is even, or two rectangles of size `(a-1)/2 x b` and `1 x b` if `a` is odd.
   - If Bob cuts parallel to the `b` side, he gets two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)` if `b` is even, or two rectangles of size `a x (b-1)/2` and `a x 1` if `b` is odd.

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - For the new rectangle to be different from the original, the resulting pieces must be able to be rearranged to form a rectangle with different dimensions.
   - If `a` and `b` are both odd, the resulting pieces will be `1 x b` and `(a-1) x b` or `a x 1` and `a x (b-1)`, which cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
   - If one of `a` or `b` is even, the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the resulting pieces will be `a x (a/2)` or `(b/2) x b`, which are essentially the same rectangle as the original (rotated).

### Program Analysis:
Let's look at the provided program and compare it with the above observations.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

1. **Condition for Both Sides Odd:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` correctly identifies cases where both `a` and `b` are odd, and in these cases, Bob cannot form a new rectangle. This part is correct.

2. **Condition for Half Dimensions:**
   - The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` correctly identifies cases where cutting the rectangle results in pieces that form the same rectangle (rotated). This part is also correct.

3. **Remaining Cases:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that either one of `a` or `b` is even, or the dimensions are not half of each other, allowing Bob to form a new rectangle. This part is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
