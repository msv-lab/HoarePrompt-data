### Reasoning:
The given problem requires determining if Bob can form another rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two parts and rearranging them. The key conditions are:

1. If both dimensions of the rectangle (a and b) are odd, it's impossible to form another rectangle because cutting would result in rectangles of size 1x(a-1) and 1xb, which cannot be rearranged into a new rectangle.
2. If one dimension is exactly half of the other (i.e., a/2 == b or b/2 == a), it's also impossible to form another rectangle because the resulting two rectangles will be identical to the original when rearranged.
3. In all other cases, it is possible to form another rectangle.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

- The code correctly handles the first condition by checking if both `a` and `b` are odd.
- The code correctly handles the second condition by checking if one dimension is half of the other.
- The code correctly handles the third condition by printing 'YES' for all other cases.

However, there is a subtle issue with the second condition. The code uses floating-point division (`/`), which can lead to precision issues, especially with large numbers. It's better to use integer division (`//`) and check for equality with an integer result. The corrected condition should be `a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a`.

Here's the corrected part of the code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Correctness:
Given the original code's logic, it seems to work correctly based on the provided test cases. However, due to the potential precision issue with floating-point division, the correctness is technically **False**. The code should be corrected to use integer division to ensure accuracy.

Correctness: **False**
