### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the conditions specified in the program and verify if they correctly determine whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting the original rectangle.

1. **Condition: If both `a` and `b` are odd**
   - If both dimensions of the rectangle are odd, then cutting the rectangle parallel to either side will result in two rectangles with one dimension being odd and the other being half of the other dimension (which will still be a fraction if the original dimension was odd, and thus not an integer). Therefore, it is impossible to form a new rectangle with integer sides from these two resulting rectangles.
   - This condition is correct.

2. **Condition: If one dimension is exactly half of the other**
   - If one dimension is exactly half of the other, cutting the rectangle parallel to the longer side will result in two rectangles that are essentially 1x(other dimension) or (other dimension)x1. These two 1x(other dimension) rectangles can only form a 1x(2 * other dimension) rectangle, which is essentially the same as the original rectangle (just rotated or in a different orientation).
   - This condition is also correct.

3. **Else**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the resulting two rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   - This condition is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified conditions and provides the correct output for each test case as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
