In the given `while` loop, the condition is `l <= r`, where `l` is initialized to 0 and `r` is initialized to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l <= r` must be true initially. 

Let's analyze the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this variable is not part of the loop condition).
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15 (these variables are not part of the loop condition).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 (this variable is not part of the loop condition).
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `sunks` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop condition).

The loop condition `l <= r` depends on the values of `l` and `r`. Given that `l` is initialized to 0 and `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is 0, then `r` would be `-1`, and the condition `0 <= -1` would be false, preventing the loop from executing.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n` - 1; `sunks` is 0; `n` must be at least 1**
