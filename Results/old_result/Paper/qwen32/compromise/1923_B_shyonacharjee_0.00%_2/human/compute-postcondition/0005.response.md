The code snippet sorts the list of tuples created by zipping `positions` and `healths` based on the absolute value of the positions. This means that `monsters` will be a list of tuples where each tuple contains a position and its corresponding health, sorted by the absolute value of the position.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by space; `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space; `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position.**
