Postcondition: **`t` is 1; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is an integer; `healths` is a list of integers; `positions` is a list of integers; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`; `position` is the position from the 3rd index of `monsters`; `health` is the health from the 3rd index of `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`; `bullets_needed` is `health`; `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + health > time_available`, otherwise `success` remains unchanged; `i` is 3. If `total_bullets_used + health` is greater than `time_available`, the loop or if statement is broken out of and `success` is set to False.**
