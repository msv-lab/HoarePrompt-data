The given code snippet reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This value represents the number of test cases, and it is specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case are not affected by this line of code, as they are not mentioned or initialized in the given snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.**
