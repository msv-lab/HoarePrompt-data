Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three integers, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.**
