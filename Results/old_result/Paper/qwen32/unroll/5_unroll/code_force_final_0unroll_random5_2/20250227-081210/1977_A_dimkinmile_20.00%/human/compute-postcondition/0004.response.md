The given initial state describes two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes in a tower. Additionally, it is specified that `n` is less than `m`. The code snippet provided contains a simple print statement that outputs the string `'No'`.

The print statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `m` directly. It simply outputs the string `'No'` regardless of the input values.

Therefore, based on the provided information:
Output: **No**
