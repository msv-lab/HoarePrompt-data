You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Here, 1 <= t <= 10^4 is the number of test cases, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element in the list. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Name and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a number, but the name `func_1` is not descriptive and makes the code harder to understand.
   - The function `func_1` is called inside the loop, but its purpose is not clear from the context. The function seems to be trying to count trailing zeros, but it is not used correctly in the logic to determine the winner.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the winner is not correctly implemented. The program calculates the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros, but it does not correctly simulate the game's moves.
   - The program does not simulate Anna's move of reversing the digits of a number. Instead, it only counts trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the final number.
   - The program does not concatenate numbers as Sasha would do in his turn. It only checks the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of trailing zeros, which does not reflect the actual game mechanics.

3. **Incorrect Variable Name**:
   - The variable `subtract_zero` is used to accumulate the number of trailing zeros, but its name does not reflect its purpose clearly.
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules. The final number after all moves is not correctly calculated.

4. **Typographical Error**:
   - The output string for Sasha is incorrectly written as `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
- Anna can reverse either 14 to 41 or 2 to 2.
- If Anna reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than 10^2 = 100. Sasha wins.
- If Anna reverses 2 to 2, Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than 10^2 = 100. Sasha wins.
- The program, however, does not correctly simulate these moves and may incorrectly determine the winner.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
