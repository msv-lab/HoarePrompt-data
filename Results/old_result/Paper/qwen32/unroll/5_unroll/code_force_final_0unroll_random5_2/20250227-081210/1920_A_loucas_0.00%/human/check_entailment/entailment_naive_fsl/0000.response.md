Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not count the number of integers k that satisfy all the constraints. Instead, it attempts to find a single integer k that meets the constraints and prints it, which is not the correct approach.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. The program only finds and prints one integer k that satisfies the constraints (the first one found in the range), but it should count all such integers.
2. The logic for counting valid k values is missing.
3. The program does not handle cases where no valid k exists, as it will print the last value of `num` which may not be valid.

Let's consider the first example provided in the problem statement:

Input:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

The correct output should be `7` (the integers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). However, the provided program will likely print `3` (the first valid integer it finds) or some other incorrect value, instead of `7`.

To fix the program, you need to count all integers k that satisfy all the constraints, not just find one. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.add(a)
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(big), min(less) + 1):
            if i not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version correctly counts all valid integers k that satisfy all the constraints.
