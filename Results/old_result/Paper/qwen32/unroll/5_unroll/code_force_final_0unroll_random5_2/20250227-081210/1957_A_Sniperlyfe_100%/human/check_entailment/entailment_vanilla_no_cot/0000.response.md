Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. The function `func_1` divides the frequency of each stick length by 3, which assumes that only triangles (3-sided polygons) can be formed. However, the problem statement allows for the formation of any regular polygon, which could have 3 or more sides.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider forming polygons with the minimum number of sides (3) up to the maximum possible number of sides (n) using the sticks of the same length. The correct approach would involve checking for the highest number of sides a regular polygon can have using the sticks of the same length and then calculating how many such polygons can be formed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    polygons = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # Check for the maximum number of sides a polygon can have
        for sides in range(3, count + 1):
            if count % sides == 0:
                polygons += count // sides
                break
    return polygons

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))
```

This corrected function iterates over the possible number of sides for a polygon and checks if the count of sticks of a particular length can form a polygon with that number of sides. It then adds the number of such polygons to the total count and breaks out of the loop to avoid counting the same sticks multiple times for different polygons.
