Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of the provided program. The program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The program does not account for the requirement that the difference `n - m` must be even to allow for both additions and removals of cubes.

To illustrate the flaw, consider the example provided in the original assessment: `n = 3` and `m = 2`. The program would output "Yes", but this is incorrect because Nikita would need to perform the following sequence of moves:
1. Add a cube.
2. Add another cube.
3. Remove a cube.

This sequence requires an odd number of moves (3), but the difference `n - m` is 1, which is odd. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes with `n` moves in this case.

The correct condition should be that `n` must be at least `m` and `n - m` must be even. This ensures that the number of moves allows for the necessary additions and removals to result in exactly `m` cubes.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
