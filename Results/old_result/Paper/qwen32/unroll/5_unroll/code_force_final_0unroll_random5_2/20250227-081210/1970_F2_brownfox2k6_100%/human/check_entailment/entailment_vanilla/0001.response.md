### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the given program is correct based on the problem statement.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Field Representation**: The field is represented as a 2D grid with characters indicating entities (players, goals, Quaffle, Bludger).
2. **Actions**: Entities can move (U, D, L, R), catch the Quaffle (C), or throw the Quaffle (T).
3. **Scoring**: A team scores if a player throws the Quaffle into the opposing team's goal.
4. **Elimination**: A player is eliminated if they occupy the same cell as the Bludger.
5. **Output**: Events (goals and eliminations) with timestamps, and the final score.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code contains two functions:
1. **`func_1(obj, d)`**: This function updates the position of an object (`obj`) based on the direction (`d`).
2. **`func_2(t)`**: This function checks for players that are eliminated by the Bludger and prints the elimination event with the timestamp (`t`).

#### Issues and Missing Components:
1. **Initialization**: The code does not initialize the field, players, goals, Quaffle, or Bludger positions.
2. **Action Handling**: There is no code to handle the actions (U, D, L, R, C, T).
3. **Goal Scoring**: There is no code to handle scoring when the Quaffle is thrown into a goal.
4. **Output**: The code does not print the final score.
5. **Bludger Interaction**: The code does not move the Bludger or handle its interactions with players.
6. **Variable Definitions**: The variables `player`, `blud`, and `t` are used but not defined in the provided code.

#### Conclusion:
Given the provided code, it is incomplete and does not cover the entire scope of the problem requirements. The code lacks the necessary logic to handle the game dynamics, scoring, and output as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
