To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the code and understand what it does:

1. **Outer Loop (`for iterable in range(loop)`):**
   - This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes three empty lists: `less`, `big`, and `no`.
   - It also initializes a variable `num` to 0.

2. **Inner Loop (`for iterable2 in range(innerLoop)`):**
   - This loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of constraints for the current test case.
   - For each constraint, it reads two integers `x` and `a`.
   - Depending on the value of `x`, it appends `a` to one of the three lists:
     - If `x == 1`, `a` is appended to `big`.
     - If `x == 2`, `a` is appended to `less`.
     - If `x == 3`, `a` is appended to `no`.

3. **Finding `num`:**
   - After reading all constraints for the current test case, the code finds the smallest integer `i` that is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big` and less than the minimum value in `less`, and is not in `no`.
   - This value `i` is stored in `num`.
   - The code then prints `num`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the code prints the value of `num`.

Since the code processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately after processing each one, the final state of the variables at the end of all iterations will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- `loop` remains unchanged as it is set to `t` at the beginning.
- The lists `less`, `big`, and `no` will be empty at the end of each iteration of the outer loop, as they are re-initialized at the start of each iteration.
- `num` will hold the last computed value after the last test case, but it is not used further after printing.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; loop is an integer equal to t; less, big, and no are empty lists; num holds the last computed value but is not used further.**
