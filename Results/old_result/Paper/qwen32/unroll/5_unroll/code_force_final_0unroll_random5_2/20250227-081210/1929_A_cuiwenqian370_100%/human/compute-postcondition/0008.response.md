To determine the output state after the given loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `array`: The last list of integers processed in the loop.
   - `data`: Remains unchanged.
   - `t`: Remains unchanged.
   - `index`: Increments by 1 for each iteration plus the length of each processed array.
   - `results`: Contains the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration.
   
2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for result in results:
       print(result)
   ```

The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. Since the loop only involves printing the `results`, it does not modify any of the variables `array`, `data`, `t`, or `index`. The `results` list itself remains unchanged as well, but its contents are printed.

Given this, the output state will be:

- `array`: Remains the same as in the initial state.
- `data`: Remains unchanged.
- `t`: Remains unchanged.
- `index`: Remains unchanged.
- `results`: Remains unchanged, but its contents are printed.

Since there is no change to the variables `array`, `data`, `t`, and `index`, and we are only printing the contents of `results`, the output state is:

Output State: **`array` remains the same, `data` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, and `results` remains unchanged but its contents are printed.**
