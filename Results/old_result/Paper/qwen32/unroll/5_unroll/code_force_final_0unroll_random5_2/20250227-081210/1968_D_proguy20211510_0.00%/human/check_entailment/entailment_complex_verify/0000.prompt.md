You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: A list of "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists: a permutation `p` and an array `a`. For each test case, it determines the winner between "Bodya" and "Sasha" based on the values in `a` and the permutation `p`, or declares a "Draw" if the outcome is tied. The function outputs "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program makes incorrect assumptions and does not account for all possible scenarios. Here are a few issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Maximum Scores**:
   - The program assumes that the player who reaches the maximum value in the array `a` will always win. However, this is not necessarily true. Players can make strategic moves to maximize their scores, and the game involves multiple turns. The program does not simulate the game accurately for all possible moves and positions.

2. **Incorrect Simulation of Moves**:
   - The program only simulates the first `k` moves and then assumes the rest of the moves will be to the position with the maximum value in `a`. This is not correct because the players can choose to stay in their current position or move to `p_x` on each turn. The program does not explore all possible move sequences.

3. **Inefficient Calculation of Scores**:
   - The program calculates the scores by appending to lists `b` and `s` and then summing them up. This is not efficient and can lead to incorrect results if the game involves long cycles or if the players make different moves that affect the scores differently.

4. **Handling of Cycles**:
   - The problem involves permutations, which can form cycles. The program does not handle cycles correctly. If both players are in cycles, the program does not account for the possibility of both players being in the same cycle and the scores accumulating differently over time.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 1 2
3 4 1 2
1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- Both players start at positions with the same score value of `1`.
- On the first turn, both players can either stay or move. If they both stay, their scores remain `1`.
- On the second turn, they can again either stay or move. If they both stay, their scores remain `1`.
- After two turns, both players have the same score of `2`, resulting in a draw.

The provided program would incorrectly output "Bodya" or "Sasha" instead of "Draw" due to its incorrect handling of the game mechanics and score calculations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least this case, and the correctness is False.
