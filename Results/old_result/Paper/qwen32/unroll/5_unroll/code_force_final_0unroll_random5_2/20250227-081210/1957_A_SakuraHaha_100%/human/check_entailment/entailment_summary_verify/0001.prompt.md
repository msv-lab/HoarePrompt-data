You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads the number of sticks and their lengths for a single test case, counts how many times each stick length appears, and calculates how many complete sets of three sticks of the same length can be formed. It then prints the number of such sets.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, with the constraint that each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is used in more than one polygon. The key point is that regular polygons have all sides of equal length.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `a`.

2. **Counting Sticks:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Calculating Polygons:**
   - The program then iterates over the counts of each stick length.
   - For each stick length `x`, the number of polygons that can be formed is calculated as `x // 3` (integer division). This is because the smallest regular polygon is a triangle (3 sides), and thus, to form a polygon, we need at least 3 sticks of the same length.

4. **Output:**
   - The program sums up the number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length and prints the total.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program assumes that any set of 3 sticks of the same length can form a polygon, which is correct for triangles. However, it does not account for polygons with more than 3 sides.
- The program does not consider that polygons with more sides (e.g., squares, pentagons) could potentially be formed if there are enough sticks of the same length.
- For example, in the fourth test case provided, the program would output `0` for the sticks of length `2` and `4` because it only considers forming triangles, whereas it could form a pentagon with side length `2` and a square with side length `4`.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it only considers forming triangles and does not account for polygons with more than 3 sides.

### Correctness: **False**
