### Reasoning:
The given program is supposed to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an array, and for each array, it checks if the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation.

The program's logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and returns 'Yes' if it is. However, if the array is not sorted, it incorrectly returns 'No' without considering the possibility of sorting the array through the allowed operations.

For example, in the second test case of the problem statement, the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` can be sorted by splitting it into `[7, 9]` and `[2, 2, 3]`, swapping them to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted. However, the function `func_1` would return 'No' because the array is not initially sorted.

The correct approach would involve checking if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part is less than or equal to the first part, and the concatenation of the second part followed by the first part results in a sorted array. This is not what `func_1` does.
