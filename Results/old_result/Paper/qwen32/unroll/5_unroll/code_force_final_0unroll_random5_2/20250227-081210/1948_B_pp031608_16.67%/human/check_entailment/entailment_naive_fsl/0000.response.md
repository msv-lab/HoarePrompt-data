Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in Loop Condition and Insertion**:
   - The loop iterates through the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and greater than 10. However, it only handles the case where the current element is greater than the next element and greater than 10 by splitting the current element into its digits. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of needing to split multiple elements or elements that are not adjacent but still cause the list to be unsorted.
   - The insertion of digits is done incorrectly. For example, if `list1[p - 1]` is 12, the code inserts `12 // 10` (which is 1) at `p - 1` and `12 % 10` (which is 2) at `p`. This should instead insert the digits '1' and '2' as separate elements, i.e., `list1[p - 1:p - 1] = [1, 2]`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted. However, the program only calls `func_1` once after attempting to make a single pass through the list. This is insufficient because the list might still be unsorted even after one pass, and multiple passes might be required to fully sort the list by splitting elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split, or where elements need to be split multiple times. For example, if the list is `[12, 34, 56]`, the program might only split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in `[1, 2, 34, 56]`, which is still unsorted.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Sorted Check**:
   - The program checks if the list is sorted after attempting to make a single pass. However, it does not ensure that the list is sorted after all possible splits have been made.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Continuously check and split elements until the list is sorted.
- Ensure that the digits of a split number are inserted correctly.
- Handle cases where multiple elements need to be split.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        new_a = []
        for x in a:
            if x >= 10:
                changed = True
                new_a.extend(int(digit) for digit in str(x))
            else:
                new_a.append(x)
        a = new_a
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This version of the program continuously splits elements until the list is sorted or no further splits are possible, ensuring that all potential cases are handled correctly.
