Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty after optimally splitting the array derived from the string `s`. The penalty for each subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The program, however, simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and prints this difference. This does not take into account the optimal splitting of the array or the calculation of penalties based on the described rules.

For example, in the third test case of the provided input, the string is `+-+-+-`. The optimal splitting would be `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` or simply `([1,-1,1,-1,1,-1])` which results in a penalty of `0` since each subarray sums to `0`. The program, however, would output `-3` (3 more '-' than '+'), which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
