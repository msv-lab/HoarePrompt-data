The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function determines for each test case whether the second row is reachable from the first row based on specific movement rules and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to each test case.
