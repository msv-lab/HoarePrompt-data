Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description by checking the three conditions for each test case:

1. If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
2. If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case, reading the three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then applies the conditions to determine the correct output for each test case.

The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that the program would fail to handle as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
