Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop `for i in range(n):` should start from 1, not 0. The problem specifies that Vladislav wrote integers from 1 to n, inclusive, not from 0 to n-1. So, the loop should be `for i in range(1, n+1):`.

2. **Global Variable `soma`**: The variable `soma` is being used as a global variable to accumulate the sum across all test cases. This means that the sum from the previous test case will carry over to the next test case, which is incorrect. The sum should be reset for each test case.

3. **Function `func_1` Placement**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is used, which is not a syntax error in Python but is a poor coding practice. It should be defined before it is called.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

def main():
    N = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(N):
        n = int(input())
        soma = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            soma += func_1(i)
        results.append(soma)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

main()
```

In this corrected version:
- The loop `for i in range(1, n+1):` correctly iterates from 1 to n.
- The variable `soma` is reset for each test case.
- The function `func_1` is defined before it is used.
- The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed after all test cases are processed.
