### Reasoning:

The provided Python function `func_1()` is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works and whether it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes a list `values` with a size of `2 * 10^5 + 1` (to accommodate all possible values of `n` up to `2 * 10^5`). Each element in this list is initialized to 0.

2. **Pre-computation of Cumulative Digit Sums**:
   - The function then pre-computes the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `2 * 10^5`. This is done using a nested loop:
     - The outer loop iterates from 1 to `2 * 10^5`.
     - The inner loop converts each number `i` to a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts the character back to an integer, and adds it to `sum_value_digits`.
     - After computing the sum of the digits for `i`, the function updates `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i - 1]` and `sum_value_digits`. This effectively keeps a running total of the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the pre-computed cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The pre-computation step ensures that the sum of the digit sums for any `n` can be retrieved in constant time `O(1)` by simply accessing `values[n]`.
   - The function handles up to `10^4` test cases efficiently, with each test case taking constant time due to the pre-computation step.
   - The function correctly computes the sum of the digit sums for each test case based on the pre-computed values.

Given the above reasoning, the function is correct and meets the problem requirements.
