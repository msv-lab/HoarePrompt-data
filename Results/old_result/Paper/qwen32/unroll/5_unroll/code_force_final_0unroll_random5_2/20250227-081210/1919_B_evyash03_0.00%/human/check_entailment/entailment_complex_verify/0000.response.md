### Reasoning

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that their concatenation equals `a`.
- The penalty for a subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.
- We need to find the minimum total penalty for all possible splits.

#### Program Analysis:
The given program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance of '+' and '-' characters goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end.
   - This does not reflect the penalty calculation as defined. The penalty should be calculated as the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Subarrays**:
   - The program does not correctly identify and split the array into subarrays that minimize the total penalty.
   - For example, in the test case `+-+-+-`, the optimal split is `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`. However, the program counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which results in an incorrect penalty.

3. **Example of Failure**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 6` with the string `+-+-+-`.
   - The correct optimal split is `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` with a penalty of `0`.
   - The provided program will output `3` because it counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which is not the correct penalty calculation.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the penalty. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which does not reflect the penalty calculation as defined in the problem statement.

### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This is not the correct approach to calculating the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
