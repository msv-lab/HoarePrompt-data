Output State: **The function will receive multiple test cases. For each test case, it will first receive an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. Following this, it will receive 2n integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function should handle up to 5000 such test cases. `n` is an input integer.**

In simple terms, the variable `n` has been assigned the value of the input integer, representing the number of pairs of integers for the current test case. The other conditions and constraints about the test cases remain unchanged.
