Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence, but it does not handle the base case correctly and the logic for generating the sequence seems flawed.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that results in exactly X increasing subsequences. However, the return statement `(0, 0)` in the base case does not contribute to the sequence and seems incorrect.

2. The logic inside the loop for generating the sequence is overly complex and does not directly map to the problem of generating an increasing subsequence count.

3. The provided examples in the problem description suggest that the sequence should be carefully constructed to achieve the exact count of increasing subsequences. The current implementation does not seem to follow this logic.

Let's consider a simple example:
- For X = 2, the correct output should be an array with 1 element, as the array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence [0].

However, the provided code does not handle this correctly. The function `func_1` does not generate the correct sequence for X = 2 or other test cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not generate the required array for all potential cases.
