Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. The main issue lies in the logic used to compute the result after the `func_1` function call.

The function `func_1` correctly computes the frequency of each card number in the list `arr`, but it limits the frequency to `k` for each card number. This part of the function is correct.

However, the logic in the main loop that uses the output of `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true, otherwise it prints `n`. This logic does not correctly account for the operations that can be performed to minimize the number of cards.

The correct approach involves understanding that each group of `k` identical cards can be reduced to `k-1` cards. Therefore, for each card number, the number of cards that cannot be reduced further is the remainder when the frequency of that card number is divided by `k`. The minimum number of cards left in the hand is the sum of these remainders.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        remaining_cards = sum([freq[num] % k for num in freq])
        if remaining_cards == 0:
            remaining_cards = k  # If all cards are perfectly grouped, we can have at least k-1 cards left
        print(remaining_cards)
```

Given the flawed logic in the provided program, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
