In the provided for loop, the loop header only contains the variable `_` and the function `input()`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is expected to be the number of test cases, `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0, as the loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only variable we can adjust in the loop header is the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` (the number of test cases) is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
