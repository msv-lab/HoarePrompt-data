You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". It then determines if the count of "U" in `s` is odd and appends 'yes' to the results if true, otherwise 'no'. Finally, it prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the count of "U".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem revolves around a game involving coins arranged in a circle. Players Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins. The goal is to determine if Alice, who goes first, will win if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:

1. **Game Dynamics**: 
   - Removing a coin and flipping its neighbors can change the state of the game.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - The game can be analyzed by focusing on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, any move Alice makes will leave an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wins if she can force Bob into a position where there is an even number of facing-up coins.
   - Bob wins if he can force Alice into a position where there is an odd number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion from Observations:

- If the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always win by playing optimally.
- If the initial number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always win by playing optimally.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) in each test case, and checks the parity of this count:
- If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list.
- If the count of 'U' is even, it appends 'no' to the results list.

Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:

The program's logic aligns with the key observations and conclusions made above. It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

Correctness: **True**
