Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the number of test cases. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. The current value of `total` modulo `n` is not equal to 0.**
