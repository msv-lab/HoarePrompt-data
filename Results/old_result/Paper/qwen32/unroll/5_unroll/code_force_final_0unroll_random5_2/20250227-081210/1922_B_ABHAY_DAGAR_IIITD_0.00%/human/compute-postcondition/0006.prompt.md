You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        
        total_count = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        
        results.append(res)
        
    #State: results is a list containing the computed results for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: results is a list containing the computed results for each test case, and each result has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
