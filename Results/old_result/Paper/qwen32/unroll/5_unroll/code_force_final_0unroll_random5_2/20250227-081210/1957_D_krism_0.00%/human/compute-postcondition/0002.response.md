The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user within the range 1 to 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is within the range 1 to 10^9. 

The execution of the code does not affect the variables `t` and `n`. The variable `a` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so it remains unchanged. The new variable `arr` is introduced and populated with the integers from the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer input provided by the user such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `arr` contains `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `arr_i` ≤ 10^9.**
