Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the next integer input. The initial state of `t` and the subsequent values for the number of sticks and their lengths remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
