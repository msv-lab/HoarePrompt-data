### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Total number of possible pairs**: For \(n\) children, the total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Friendship value increase**: If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
3. **Expected value calculation**: The expected sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions needs to be calculated.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It reads \(m\) lines of input specifying the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculations**:
   - \(M\) is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - \(c\) is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
   - \(a\) accumulates the sum of initial friendship values.
   - The nested loop for \(k\) iterations is intended to calculate the expected sum, but the logic is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The inner loop is intended to calculate the expected sum, but the formula used is incorrect. The program incorrectly adds the product of \(c\), \(i\), \(c\), and \(m\) to \(s\) in each iteration, which does not correctly represent the expected value calculation.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the expected increase in friendship values over \(k\) excursions.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the probability of choosing a friend pair in each excursion, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
2. Calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each friend pair over \(k\) excursions.
3. Sum up the expected values for all friend pairs and non-friend pairs.

The correct expected value for the sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions can be derived as follows:
- For each friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen is \(\frac{m \cdot k}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The expected sum of friendship values for a friend pair with initial value \(f\) chosen \(x\) times is \(f + (f+1) + \cdots + (f+x-1) = x \cdot f + \frac{x(x-1)}{2}\).
- Summing up these expected values for all friend pairs and multiplying by the probability of choosing a friend pair gives the expected value.

However, the provided program does not implement this logic correctly. Instead, it uses an incorrect formula that does not account for the expected increase in friendship values properly.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
