To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, let's analyze the given code snippet. The loop iterates over integers from 1 to `inf` (which is set to 200001). For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits and updates the `values` list at index `i` by adding this sum to the value at index `i-1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

1. **Initialization**: The `values` list is initialized with 200001 elements, all set to 0.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For `i = 1`, the sum of digits is 1. Thus, `values[1] = values[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - For `i = 2`, the sum of digits is 2. Thus, `values[2] = values[1] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3`.
   - For `i = 10`, the sum of digits is 1. Thus, `values[10] = values[9] + 1`.
   - This process continues up to `i = 200000`.

The `values` list will store cumulative sums of the digit sums of all integers from 1 up to the current index `i`.

**Output State**: The `values` list will have been updated such that each index `i` contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. The other variables (`t` and `n` for each test case) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **the `values` list will have each index `i` containing the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**
