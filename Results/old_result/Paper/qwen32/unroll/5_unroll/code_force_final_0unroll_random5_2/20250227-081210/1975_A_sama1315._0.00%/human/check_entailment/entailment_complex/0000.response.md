Reasoning:
The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The program's purpose is to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping its prefix and suffix any number of times.

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - This function checks if the given array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - This function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by swapping its prefix and suffix. It only checks if the array is already sorted.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array from the test case and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The key issue is that `func_1` does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by swapping its prefix and suffix. It only checks if the array is already sorted. The problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the described operation any number of times, which is not what `func_1` does.

For example, in the second test case provided in the problem statement, the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` can be sorted by performing the described operation, but `func_1` would return 'No' because the array is not initially sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
