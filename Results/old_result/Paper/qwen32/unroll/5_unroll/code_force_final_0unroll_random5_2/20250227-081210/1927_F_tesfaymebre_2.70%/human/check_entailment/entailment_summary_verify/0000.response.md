Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the implementation.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The solution involves:
1. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) for Cycle Detection**: This helps in identifying cycles in the graph efficiently.
2. **DFS (Depth-First Search) for Cycle Extraction**: Once a cycle is detected, DFS is used to extract the vertices involved in the cycle.

### Code Analysis
The code uses a `DSU` class (not provided in the snippet, but assumed to be implemented correctly) for union-find operations and a DFS function to traverse and extract cycles. Let's break down the key parts of the code:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, `func_4()`, and `func_5()` are utility functions to read input values.
   - `func_6()` processes each test case by reading the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, building the graph, sorting edges, and using union-find to detect cycles.

2. **Union-Find Operations**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of weight.
   - For each edge, the union-find structure checks if the vertices are already connected. If they are, it identifies a cycle and updates the minimum edge weight.

3. **Cycle Extraction**:
   - Once a cycle is detected, the `dfs` function is used to extract the cycle starting from the node where the cycle was detected.

### Function Summary
The summary for `func_7()` correctly states that it processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6()` for each one.

### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment
1. **Union-Find Implementation**:
   - The original assessment assumes issues with the union-find implementation. However, if the `DSU` class is correctly implemented, it should handle the merging of sets and tracking of the minimum edge weight properly.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The logic for cycle detection (checking if two vertices are already connected) is correct. The issue might lie in the union-find implementation itself, not the logic.

3. **DFS for Cycle Extraction**:
   - The `dfs` function is supposed to extract the cycle once a cycle is detected. If the cycle is correctly identified, the DFS should work as intended.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code should handle disconnected graphs correctly if the union-find implementation is robust.

### Example Case Analysis
Let's consider the example case provided in the original assessment:
```
1
4 4
1 2 10
2 3 20
3 4 30
4 1 40
```
The correct output should be:
```
10 4
1 2 3 4
```
If the union-find and DFS are correctly implemented, this case should be handled properly.

### Conclusion
Given the problem description and the provided code, if the `DSU` class is correctly implemented, the code should work as intended. The original assessment seems to assume issues with the union-find implementation without providing evidence. Therefore, the code is likely correct if the union-find operations are handled properly.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
