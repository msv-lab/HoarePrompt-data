Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `a`. It counts the number of '1's in the string `a` and prints 'YES' if the count is 0, greater than 2 and even, or exactly 2 with the two '1's not adjacent. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
