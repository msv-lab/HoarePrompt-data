The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of participants and a series of screenshots showing the order of participants. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to reconstruct a consistent order of participants across all screenshots, considering the author of each screenshot. The function outputs 'yes' if such a consistent order can be reconstructed and 'no' otherwise.
