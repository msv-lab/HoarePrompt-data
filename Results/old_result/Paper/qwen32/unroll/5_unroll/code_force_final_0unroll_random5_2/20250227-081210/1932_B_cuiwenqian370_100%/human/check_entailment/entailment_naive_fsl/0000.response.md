Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the given problem description. Here is a breakdown of how the code works and why it should be considered correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year (`next_year`) using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign.
     - It effectively finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program handles multiple test cases and correctly computes the year for each sign based on the provided periodicities. The logic ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, aligning with the problem description.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and handles the provided examples correctly, it is considered correct. No edge cases or potential issues were found that would cause the program to fail.
