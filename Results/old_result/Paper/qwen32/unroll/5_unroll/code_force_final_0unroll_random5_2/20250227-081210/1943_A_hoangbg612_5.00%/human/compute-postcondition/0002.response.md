To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the provided code and understand its behavior for each test case.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for _ in range(T)`):**
   - This loop runs `T` times, where each iteration processes a different test case.
   
2. **Inner Code:**
   - `S = int(input())`: Reads an integer `S`, which is the expected sum of the values in the dictionary `M`.
   - `N = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads a list of integers `N` of length `n`.
   - `N.sort()`: Sorts the list `N` in ascending order.
   - `cur = -1`: Initializes a variable `cur` to `-1`.
   - `M = {}`: Initializes an empty dictionary `M` to keep track of counts of consecutive integers.

3. **First Inner Loop (`for num in N`):**
   - Iterates over each number `num` in the sorted list `N`.
   - If `num > cur`, it checks if `num > cur + 1`. If true, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and initializes `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Post First Inner Loop:**
   - Checks if the sum of values in `M` equals `S`. If true, it increments `cur` by 1.
   
5. **Second Inner Loop (`for i in range(cur)`):**
   - Iterates over each integer `i` from `0` to `cur-1`.
   - If the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   
6. **Final Statement:**
   - `print(cur)`: Prints the final value of `cur`.

### Output State:
After processing all test cases, the code will output the final value of `cur` for each test case. The state of the variables `T` and `t` (if `t` is used elsewhere in the code, which is not shown here) remains unchanged. The list `N` and dictionary `M` are local to each iteration of the outer loop and do not persist across iterations.

### Final Output State:
Given that the problem requires the output state in a specific format and considering that the code processes each test case independently, the output state will be a series of printed values of `cur` for each test case. However, since we need to describe the state after all iterations, we can describe it in a general form.

Output State: **The final printed value of `cur` for each of the `T` test cases.**

Since the exact values of `cur` depend on the input data, we cannot provide a specific numerical value here. The output state is a sequence of `cur` values, one for each test case.
