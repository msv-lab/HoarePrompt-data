Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9; a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; x_i is an integer such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, the program will print 'YES' if it is possible to defeat all monsters with the available bullets within the time constraints, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The values of t, n, k, a_i, and x_i remain unchanged from the initial state.**
