The provided code snippet only assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This does not affect the initial state of `arr` or any other variable. The `input` variable now holds a reference to the `sys.stdin.read` function, which can be used to read input from the standard input stream.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`.**
