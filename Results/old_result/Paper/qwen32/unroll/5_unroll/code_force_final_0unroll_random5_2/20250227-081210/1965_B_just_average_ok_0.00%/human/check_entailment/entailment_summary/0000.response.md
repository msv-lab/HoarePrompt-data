### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program's logic and verify if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Initial Sequence Construction**:
   - The program starts by creating a list `nums` containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This list is essentially the binary representation of numbers up to \(2^{24} - 1\).
   - This list can form any sum from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) through subsequences, which is a well-known property of binary numbers.

2. **Adjusting for `k`**:
   - The program identifies the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and removes this power from the list.
   - It then appends three new numbers to the list:
     - \(k - \text{highest power of 2}\): This ensures that there is no subsequence that sums to `k` because the highest power of 2 that was removed cannot be used to form `k` again.
     - \(k + 1\): Ensures that there is a subsequence that sums to \(k + 1\).
     - \(k + \text{highest power of 2} + 1\): Ensures that there is a subsequence that sums to a number greater than `k` but not equal to `k`.

3. **Ensuring Validity**:
   - The program ensures that for all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence that sums to `v`. This is because the initial list of powers of 2 can form all sums up to \(2^{24} - 1\), and the adjustments made do not disrupt the formation of sums for values other than `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the length of the modified list followed by the elements of the list.

### Verification:

Let's verify the given examples:

- **First Example (n=2, k=2)**:
  - Initial list: [1]
  - Highest power of 2 ≤ 2 is 2, but since 2 is not in the list, no adjustment is made except appending 1, 3, and 3 (which is redundant).
  - Final list: [1]
  - This list can form sums of 1, but not 2.

- **Second Example (n=6, k=1)**:
  - Initial list: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]
  - Highest power of 2 ≤ 1 is 1, so 1 is removed.
  - New elements: 0 (which is redundant), 2, 3.
  - Final list: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 2, 3]
  - This list can form sums of any number from 1 to 6 except 1.

- **Third Example (n=8, k=8)**:
  - Initial list: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]
  - Highest power of 2 ≤ 8 is 8, so 8 is removed.
  - New elements: 0 (which is redundant), 9, 9.
  - Final list: [1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 9, 9]
  - This list can form sums of any number from 1 to 8 except 8.

- **Fourth Example (n=9, k=3)**:
  - Initial list: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]
  - Highest power of 2 ≤ 3 is 2, so 2 is removed.
  - New elements: 1, 4, 5.
  - Final list: [1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 1, 4, 5]
  - This list can form sums of any number from 1 to 9 except 3.

- **Fifth Example (n=10, k=7)**:
  - Initial list: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]
  - Highest power of 2 ≤ 7 is 4, so 4 is removed.
  - New elements: 3, 8, 9.
  - Final list: [1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 3, 8, 9]
  - This list can form sums of any number from 1 to 10 except 7.
