### Reasoning:

The program provided is attempting to solve the problem by constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the MEX (minimum excluded value) concept. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
    - It initializes `p` as an array of `-1` of length `n`.
    - It sets `mex` to `n`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
    - The program iterates over the indices of `a` from the end to the beginning.
    - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
    - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

3. **Output**:
    - After constructing the permutation `p` for a test case, it prints `p`.

### Analysis:

The key part of the algorithm is the loop where the permutation `p` is constructed. The idea is to calculate `p[i]` such that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. 

The program sets `mex` initially to `n` and iterates backwards through the array `a`. For each `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. The update of `mex` to `min(mex, p[i])` ensures that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in `p` yet.

### Validation Against Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
    - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
    - The program calculates `p` as `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
    - We can verify that `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`, `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`, `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`, `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`, `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`.

2. **Second Example**:
    - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
    - The program calculates `p` as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
    - We can verify that `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`, `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`, `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1`, `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1`, `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1`.

3. **Third Example**:
    - `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
    - The program calculates `p` as `[2, 0, 1]`.
    - We can verify that `a_1 = MEX(2) - 2 = -2`, `a_2 = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1`, `a_3 = MEX(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` for the given examples. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples are correctly handled.

Therefore, the program is correct.
