Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, following the constraints provided in the problem description. However, the logic implemented in the program is incorrect.

The key point to consider is that the problem can be solved by checking if the prefix sum of the array (after normalizing it to the target value) never goes below zero. This is because if the prefix sum goes below zero, it implies that at some point, more water is being taken out than is available, which is not possible given the operation constraints.

The provided program calculates `curr` by summing the differences between each element and the last element, which does not correctly account for the possibility of redistributing water according to the rules. It fails to consider the cumulative effect of pouring water from one container to another and whether the cumulative water in any prefix of the array can be balanced.

For example, consider the test case `5 4 5 2 1 3`. The correct approach would involve checking if we can balance the water such that the prefix sums never go below the target value (which is the total sum divided by `n`), but the provided program does not perform this check correctly.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
