You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: the printed result of the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum possible sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of the two lists when elements are optimally paired. If all elements in both lists are the same, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it sorts one list in ascending order and the other in descending order, then computes the sum based on the specified pairing strategy.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is an array of \( n \) integers chosen from a larger array \( b_i \) and arranged in some order.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Special Cases:**
   - If both arrays \( a \) and \( b \) contain the same single element, the difference \( D \) is 0.
   - If \( n = 1 \), the program calculates the maximum difference by comparing the single element of \( a \) with the maximum and minimum elements of \( b \).

3. **General Case:**
   - The program sorts array \( a \) in ascending order and array \( b \) in descending order.
   - It then iterates through the elements of \( a \) and \( b \), calculating the maximum possible difference for each element by comparing the smallest and largest available elements in \( b \).

### Potential Issues
The program seems to follow the correct logic for maximizing the differences. However, let's verify if there are any edge cases that might not be handled correctly.

### Testing the Program
Let's consider a few test cases to ensure the program works correctly:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```
   1
   3 4
   1 2 3
   1 1 1 1
   ```
   - Expected Output: 6 (Choosing \( c = [1, 1, 1] \), \( D = |1-1| + |2-1| + |3-1| = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 \))
   - Actual Output: 0 (Special case handled correctly)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```
   1
   3 4
   1 2 3
   9 9 9 9
   ```
   - Expected Output: 24 (Choosing \( c = [9, 9, 9] \), \( D = |1-9| + |2-9| + |3-9| = 8 + 7 + 6 = 21 \))
   - Actual Output: 21 (General case handled correctly)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   ```
   1
   3 3
   1 2 3
   3 2 1
   ```
   - Expected Output: 6 (Choosing \( c = [3, 2, 1] \), \( D = |1-3| + |2-2| + |3-1| = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4 \))
   - Actual Output: 6 (General case handled correctly)

From the above test cases, the program seems to handle various scenarios correctly. However, let's consider a more complex case to ensure there are no hidden issues.

### Complex Test Case
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
- Expected Output: 20 (Choosing \( c = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] \), \( D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| + |4-2| + |5-1| = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 12 \))
- Actual Output: 12 (General case handled correctly)

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference \( D \). There are no evident edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases as per the problem description.
