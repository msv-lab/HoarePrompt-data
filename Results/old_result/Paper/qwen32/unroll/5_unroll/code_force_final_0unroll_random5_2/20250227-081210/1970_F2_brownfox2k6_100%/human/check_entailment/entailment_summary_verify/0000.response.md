### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided code snippets and the function summaries in the context of the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: The function `func_1` is intended to move an object (player or ball) on the grid based on the direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
- **Functionality**: The function correctly adjusts the coordinates of the object based on the direction provided.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Boundary Checks**: The function does not check if the new position is within the grid boundaries. This is a crucial requirement to prevent players from moving out of the field.
  - **Handling of Specific Actions**: The function does not handle actions like catching or throwing the Quaffle, which are essential parts of the game mechanics.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: The function `func_2` is intended to eliminate players who are in the same cell as the Bludger.
- **Functionality**:
  - It identifies players that are in the same cell as the Bludger.
  - It marks these players as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`.
  - It prints the elimination events in the required format.
- **Limitations**:
  - **State Management**: The function does not update the grid or handle the state of the Quaffle when a player is eliminated while carrying it.
  - **Scoring Mechanism**: The function does not handle the scoring mechanism when a player successfully puts the Quaffle in the opposing team's goal.
  - **Quaffle Reset**: The function does not reset the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Overall Game Mechanics**: The provided code snippets do not cover all the game mechanics described in the problem statement, such as:
  - Handling the Quaffle's position and movement.
  - Checking for goals and updating the score.
  - Resetting the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal.
  - Handling the actions of catching and throwing the Quaffle.
  - Ensuring that the game state is correctly updated after each action.

### Conclusion:
The provided code snippets (`func_1` and `func_2`) are incomplete and do not fully implement the requirements described in the problem statement. They handle some aspects of the game, such as moving objects and eliminating players, but they lack the necessary logic to manage the Quaffle, handle scoring, and ensure that the game state is correctly updated after each action.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
