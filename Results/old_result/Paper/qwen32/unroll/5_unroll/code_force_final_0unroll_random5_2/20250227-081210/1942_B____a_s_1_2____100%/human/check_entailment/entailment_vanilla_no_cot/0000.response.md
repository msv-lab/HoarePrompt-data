Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \). The approach in the program is flawed because it iterates from the end of the array \( a \) to the beginning and calculates the \( \texttt{MEX} \) based on the values of \( p \) that have not yet been determined, which leads to incorrect results.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate from the beginning of the array \( a \) to the end and keep track of the available numbers (i.e., the \( \texttt{MEX} \)) that have not yet been used in the permutation \( p \). Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = [False] * n
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while used[mex]:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used[p[i]] = True
        
        print(*p)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We initialize `used` as a list to keep track of which numbers have been used in the permutation \( p \).
- We maintain `mex` to represent the current minimum non-negative integer that has not been used.
- For each element in \( a \), we find the current \( \texttt{MEX} \), compute the corresponding element in \( p \), and mark it as used.
- This ensures that the permutation \( p \) is constructed correctly based on the given array \( a \).
