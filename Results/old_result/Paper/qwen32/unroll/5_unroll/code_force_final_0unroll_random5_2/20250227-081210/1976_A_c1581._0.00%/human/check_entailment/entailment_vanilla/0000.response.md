Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Password Structure**:
   - Only lowercase Latin letters and digits are allowed.
   - No digit should come after a letter.
   - Digits, if present, should be in non-decreasing order.
   - Letters, if present, should be in non-decreasing order.

2. **Input**:
   - An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of the password, followed by the password string itself.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output "YES" if the password is strong, otherwise "NO".

### Program Analysis
The program reads input and processes each password through the `func_1` function. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `digits` and `letters` lists are initialized to store digits and letters from the password, respectively.
   - `last_digit_index` is initialized to `-1` to track the last index of a digit in the password.

2. **Character Classification**:
   - The program iterates through the password to classify each character as either a digit or a letter and appends it to the respective list.
   - It also updates `last_digit_index` whenever a digit is encountered.

3. **Digit Placement Validation**:
   - After classifying characters, the program iterates through the password again.
   - If a letter is encountered after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), it returns "NO".

4. **Order Validation**:
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it returns "YES".

### Correctness Evaluation
- **Character Classification**: The program correctly classifies characters into digits and letters.
- **Digit Placement Validation**: The check for digit placement after a letter is correct.
- **Order Validation**: The program correctly checks if digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
