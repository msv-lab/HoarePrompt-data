Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses in the village, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, where `a_j` = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and `a_j` = 1 if the resident wants to live on the right side.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
