### Reasoning:

The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each involving three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of the same length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a template `t` based on the characters of `a` and `b` as follows:

- If the characters at a given position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, the template at position `i` is set to that character (in lowercase).
- If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, the template at position `i` is set to the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`, since they are different).

After creating the template, the function checks:
1. Whether both `a` and `b` match the template according to the rules.
2. Whether `c` does not match the template according to the rules.

The function then prints "YES" if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, and "NO" otherwise.

The logic in the code correctly implements the problem description:
- It creates a template based on the conditions provided.
- It checks if `a` and `b` match the template correctly.
- It checks if `c` does not match the template correctly.

The execution summary correctly describes the functionality of the function, and the example outputs match the expected results based on the provided examples.

### Correctness: **True**
