Output State: **The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. Each test case within `arr` remains in its original form but the order of test cases is reversed based on their lexicographical order.**

To break it down:
- The list `arr` contains multiple test cases.
- Each test case is a list itself, containing an integer `n`, list `a`, and list `b`.
- The entire `arr` list is sorted in descending order, meaning the test case that is lexicographically largest will appear first, and the smallest last.
