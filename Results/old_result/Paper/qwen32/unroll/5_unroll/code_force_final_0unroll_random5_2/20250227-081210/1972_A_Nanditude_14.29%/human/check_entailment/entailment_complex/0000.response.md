### Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem by iteratively comparing the difficulties of the proposed problems (`a_i`) with the expected difficulties (`b_i`). The program maintains two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse the lists `a` and `b` respectively. If the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current proposed difficulty `a[i]`, it means that the proposed problem is too difficult, and a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` should be added, replacing the most difficult problem in `a`. The program counts how many new problems are added until all `a_i` are less than or equal to `b_i`.

However, there are several issues with the provided code:
1. The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the main program logic.
2. The logic for inserting a new problem and removing the most difficult one is incorrect. Instead of simply inserting `b[j]` and removing the last element, the code attempts to insert `b[j]` at position `i` and then remove the last element, which is not the correct approach.
3. The code does not correctly handle the scenario where `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` by always removing the last element and inserting `b[j]` at position `i`, which can lead to incorrect results.

Let's consider a corrected version of the logic:
- Start with two pointers `i` and `j` at the beginning of `a` and `b`.
- If `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]`, insert `b[j]` into `a` and remove the last element of `a`.
- Increment the count of new problems added.
- Otherwise, move both pointers to the next element.
- Continue until all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.

Given the issues in the provided code, the program does not correctly implement the described logic.

### Correctness: **False**
