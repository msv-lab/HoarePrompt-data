Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string `decoded` formed by replacing each character in all strings `b` with its symmetric character from a mapping derived from the unique characters in the input strings.**
