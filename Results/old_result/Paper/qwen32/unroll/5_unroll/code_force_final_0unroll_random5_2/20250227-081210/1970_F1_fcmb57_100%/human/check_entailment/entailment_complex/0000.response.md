### Reasoning:

The provided Python program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it operates correctly according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to move a player based on the direction provided. However, in the provided code, the function is incorrectly implemented. The function currently returns `(x + dx, y + dy)`, which is correct, but the comment suggests it returns `(a + b, y + dy)`, which is incorrect and misleading.
   - The function parameters `a` and `b` are correctly used within the function to calculate the new position, so the function logic itself is correct. However, the comment needs to be corrected to reflect the actual functionality.

2. **Incorrect Goal Checking Logic**:
   - In the main loop, when a player throws the Quaffle (action 'T'), the program checks if the player's position is in the red goals and then in the blue goals. However, if the player scores in their own goal, the program should assign the point to the opposing team, not the player's team.
   - The provided code does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. It simply checks if the player's position is in the red goals and then in the blue goals, but it does not assign the point to the opposing team if the player scores in their own goal.

3. **Missing Quaffle Reset**:
   - After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field. The provided code does not reset the position of the Quaffle after a goal is scored.

4. **Incorrect Output Order**:
   - The program is supposed to print the main events of the game in ascending order of the action number. The provided code does this correctly, so no issue here.

5. **Final Score Output**:
   - The final score is printed correctly at the end of the game.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program is **not** correct as it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal and does not reset the Quaffle's position after a goal is scored.

Thus, the correct response is:

**Correctness: False**
