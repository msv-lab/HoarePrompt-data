Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Analysis:
- **t**: An integer representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4).
- **n**: An integer representing the number of integers in each test case (1 <= n <= 50).
- **k_i**: A list of integers for each test case, where each integer is between 2 and 20 (inclusive).
- **N**: An integer read from the input, which is the number of integers in the current test case.
- **vals**: A list of integers read from the input for the current test case.
- **prod**: The product of all integers in the list `vals`.
- **vprod**: A list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- **den**: The value calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`, and it is mentioned that the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(-1)
```

### Explanation:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The value to be printed is explicitly specified and does not depend on any of the variables or calculations described in the initial state. Therefore, the output will be `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k_i`, `N`, `vals`, `prod`, `vprod`, or `den`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
