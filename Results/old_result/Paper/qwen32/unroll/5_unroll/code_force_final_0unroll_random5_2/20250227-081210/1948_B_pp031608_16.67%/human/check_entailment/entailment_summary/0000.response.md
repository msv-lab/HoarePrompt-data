Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw that prevents it from correctly determining whether the array can be sorted using the allowed operations. The program attempts to sort the array by splitting numbers greater than 10 and checking if the array is sorted after each operation. However, the logic for splitting numbers and checking the sorted condition is flawed.

The main issues are:
1. The `func_1` function is called before any operations are performed, and its result is not used.
2. The loop for splitting numbers only checks the condition `if not func_1(list1)`, which is incorrect because it should attempt to split numbers regardless of whether the list is already sorted.
3. The logic to split numbers and insert them back into the list is incorrect. The program only considers splitting the number at the position `p - 1` if `list1[p - 1] > list1[p]` and `list1[p - 1] > 10`, which is not sufficient to guarantee a sorted array.
4. The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed to achieve a sorted array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
