Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The variable `soma` is not being reset for each test case. It should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case.
2. The loop `for i in range(n)` should start from 1 to `n` inclusive, not from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The function `func_1` needs to be defined before it is used in the program.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    soma = 0
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This version of the program correctly resets `soma` for each test case, sums the digits of each number from 1 to `n` inclusive, and prints the result for each test case.
