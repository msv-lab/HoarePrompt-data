The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string values, converts each of these string values to an integer, and stores them in a list called `vals`. The initial state mentions that `N` is an integer read from the input, but `N` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it remains unchanged. The variables `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are also part of the initial state but are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `N` is an integer read from the input. `vals` is a list of integers read from the input.**
