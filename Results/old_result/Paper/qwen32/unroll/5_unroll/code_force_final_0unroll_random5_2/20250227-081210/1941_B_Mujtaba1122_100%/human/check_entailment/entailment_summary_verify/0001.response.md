### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
Rudolf can perform an operation on an array `a` to reduce elements at specific indices. The operation involves selecting an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1`) and performing the following changes:
- `a[i - 1] = a[i - 1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i + 1] = a[i + 1] - 1`

The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation.

#### Code Analysis

**Function `func_1`**:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- It iterates through each element and returns `False` if any element is not zero. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
- This function is correctly implemented to check if all elements are zero.

**Function `func_2`**:
- This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero by applying the described operation.
- The loop iterates through the array from the second element to the second last element (i.e., `for i in range(1, n - 1)`).
- Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1 and if the adjacent elements `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
- If the conditions are met, it performs the operation:
  - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
- The operation logic in `func_2` is incorrect. The operation should decrement `list[i+1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively, not by multiples of `list[i-1]`.

#### Flaw in the Operation Logic
The operation logic in `func_2` incorrectly modifies the elements by multiples of `list[i-1]` instead of fixed values (1, 2, 1). This means the current implementation does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem.

#### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the operation simulation within `func_2`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
