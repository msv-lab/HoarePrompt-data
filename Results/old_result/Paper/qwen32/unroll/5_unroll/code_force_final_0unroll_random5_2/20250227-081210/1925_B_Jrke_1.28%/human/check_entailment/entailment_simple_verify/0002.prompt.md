You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum balance of the problemset as defined by the problem statement. The balance is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems, and the sum of these difficulties should equal \( x \).

Let's break down the program and verify its logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads \( t \) test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( x \) and \( n \).

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - It calculates \( k = x // n \), which is the integer division of \( x \) by \( n \).
   - If \( k == 1 \), it directly prints 1. This is because if \( x \) is less than or equal to \( n \), the only way to split \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1, resulting in a GCD of 1.

3. **Finding the Maximum Balance**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1.
   - It then iterates over possible divisors of \( x \) starting from 1 + (1 if \( x \% 2 == 0 \) else 0) up to \( \sqrt{x} \) in steps of 2 (to skip even numbers if \( x \) is odd).
   - For each divisor \( i \):
     - It checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( x \).
     - If \( i \) is a divisor and \( i \leq k \), it adds \( i \) to a list `l`.
     - If \( x // i \) is a divisor and \( x // i \leq k \), it adds \( x // i \) to the list `l`.
     - It updates `ans` to the maximum value in the list `l`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

The program tries to find the maximum possible GCD of \( n \) sub-problems with a sum of \( x \). However, there are a few issues with the approach:

- **Divisor Selection**: The program only checks divisors up to \( \sqrt{x} \) and skips even numbers if \( x \) is odd. This might miss potential candidates for the maximum GCD.
- **Sub-problem Constraints**: The program needs to ensure that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals \( x \). The current approach does not directly enforce this constraint while finding the GCD.
- **Optimal Sub-problem Distribution**: The program does not ensure that the sub-problems can be distributed such that their sum is exactly \( x \) and their GCD is maximized. For example, for the input \( x = 10 \) and \( n = 3 \), the program might find a GCD of 2, but it needs to verify if such a distribution is possible.

### Correctness:

Given the above points, the program does not guarantee that it will always find the maximum possible balance for all inputs. It might miss some valid distributions of sub-problems that could result in a higher GCD.

**Thus, the correctness of the program is:**

Correctness: **False**
