`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end` is still valid.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.**
