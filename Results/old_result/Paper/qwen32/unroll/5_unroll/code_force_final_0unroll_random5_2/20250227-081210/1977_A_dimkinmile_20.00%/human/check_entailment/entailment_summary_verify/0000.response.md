Let's analyze the problem and the provided program systematically.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add one cube to the tower.
2. Remove one cube from the tower.

The goal is to determine if, after exactly `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations:
- The number of cubes can fluctuate as Nikita can both add and remove cubes.
- The initial number of cubes is 0.
- The total number of cubes after `n` moves can range from `0 - n` to `n` (if all moves are additions or removals, respectively).

### Correct Logic:
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.
- If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, it is always possible to have exactly `m` cubes. This is because:
  - You can add `m` cubes and then remove `n - m` cubes if `n > m` (or do nothing if `n == m`).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks if `n >= m` and outputs "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This is actually correct based on the observations above:
- If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes, so the program correctly outputs "No".
- If `n >= m`, it is always possible to have `m` cubes, so the program correctly outputs "Yes".

### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the program. The function reads `n` and `m`, and prints "Yes" if `n >= m` and "No" otherwise.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is incorrect. However, based on the correct logic and the function summary, the program is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
