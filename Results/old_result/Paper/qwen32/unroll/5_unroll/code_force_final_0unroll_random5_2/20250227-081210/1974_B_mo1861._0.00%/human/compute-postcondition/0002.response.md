Let's analyze the provided for loop statement and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

The for loop statement is:
```python
for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves:
- `i` (the index variable introduced by `enumerate`)
- `c` (the character variable introduced by `enumerate`)
- `sorted(set(b))` (which is a generator of unique, sorted characters from the string `b`)

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

### Analysis:
1. **`b`**: The loop will execute if `b` contains at least one unique character. The loop iterates over the unique characters of `b` after sorting them. If `b` is an empty string, there will be no characters to iterate over, and the loop will not execute.

2. **`i` and `c`**: These are loop variables and do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. They will be automatically assigned values during each iteration of the loop.

3. **`char_map`**: This variable is not involved in the loop head and does not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the string `b` must contain at least one character. The state of `char_map` does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and must have at least one character, `char_map` is an empty dictionary**
