Correctness: **False**

The given program calculates the area of the square based on the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which is not sufficient to determine the area of the square. The program does not consider the y-coordinates, and it assumes that the side length of the square is the difference in x-coordinates, which is not always true. The side length of the square can be either the difference in x-coordinates or the difference in y-coordinates, depending on the orientation of the square.

To correctly determine the area of the square, the program should compute the differences in both x and y coordinates, and the side length of the square will be the maximum of these two differences. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for _ in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        y = [p[1] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        dy = max(y) - min(y)
        side_length = max(dx, dy)
        print(side_length * side_length)

func()
```

This corrected version considers both the x and y coordinates to determine the side length of the square correctly.
