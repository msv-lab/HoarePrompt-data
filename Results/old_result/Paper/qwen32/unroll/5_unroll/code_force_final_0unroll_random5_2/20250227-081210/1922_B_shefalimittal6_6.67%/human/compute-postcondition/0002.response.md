To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the code and understand what it does.

The code iterates `t` times, where `t` is the input integer. In each iteration, it performs the following steps:
1. It reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the next list.
2. It reads a list of integers `nums` of size `n`.
3. It creates a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each number in the list `nums`.
4. It initializes a variable `res` to 0. This variable will store the final result for the current iteration.
5. It calculates the number of ways to choose 3 numbers that are the same (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`) and adds this to `res` for each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens` that is at least 3.
6. It calculates the number of ways to choose 2 numbers that are the same and then choose a third number that is different. This is done by multiplying `math.comb(cnt, 2)` by the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` except the current count `cnt`, and adds this to `res` for each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens` that is at least 2.
7. It prints the result `res` for the current iteration.

After all `t` iterations, the loop ends, and there are no more changes to the variables `t`, `n`, `nums`, `num_of_lens`, or `res` outside of the loop. The output is printed for each iteration, but the final state of these variables is not retained after the loop completes.

Since the question asks for the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, and the only output is printed within the loop, the output state can be described as the series of printed results for each iteration.

However, if we need to describe the state of the variables at the end of the loop, the state would be:
- `t` remains unchanged as the input integer.
- `n`, `nums`, `num_of_lens`, and `res` do not retain their values after each iteration and are not relevant after the loop ends.

Since the question asks for the output state in terms of the printed results, we can describe it as follows:

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each representing the result `res` calculated for the corresponding input list in each iteration.**
