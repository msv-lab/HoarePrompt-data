The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop iterates over the range specified by `int(input())`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, which means `int(input())` can be directly related to `t` because `t` represents the number of test cases, and each test case corresponds to one iteration of the loop.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the problem statement (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `i` is 0 (before the first iteration of the loop)**
