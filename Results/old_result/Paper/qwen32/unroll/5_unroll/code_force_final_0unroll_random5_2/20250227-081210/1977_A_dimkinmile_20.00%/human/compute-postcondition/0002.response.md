The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about two integer variables, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. It is also mentioned that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. However, these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `n` or `m`, their values do not affect the output. The statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
