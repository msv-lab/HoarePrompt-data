Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to take the length of the array `c` as input, but the function name and its behavior suggest that it should be working with the array itself, not just its length. Moreover, the function does not compute the MEX of any subarray nor does it perform the operations necessary to maximize the sum of the array. Instead, it prints fixed outputs based on whether the length of the array is 2 or not, which is not a correct approach to solving the problem.

The program should:
1. Calculate the MEX for different subarrays.
2. Perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
3. Keep track of the number of operations performed.
4. Print the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

Given the examples, the function should dynamically determine the operations based on the input array, not just print hardcoded values.

Correctness: **False**
