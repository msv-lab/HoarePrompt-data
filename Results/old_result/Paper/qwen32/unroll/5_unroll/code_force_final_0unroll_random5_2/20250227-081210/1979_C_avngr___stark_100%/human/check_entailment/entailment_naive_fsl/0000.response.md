Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, which does not help in determining the correct distribution of bets to ensure that you come out ahead in the game.

The problem requires finding a way to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This means we need to find a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \; i \]

A simple solution to this problem is to set each \( x_i = 1 \) and check if the total sum of bets is less than the minimum \( k_i \). If not, then there is no valid distribution. If yes, then \( x_i = 1 \) for all \( i \) is a valid solution.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        k = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        total_bets = n
        min_k = min(k)
        
        if total_bets < min_k:
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, [1] * n)))
        else:
            results.append("-1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

# Example usage:
# solve()
```

This program reads the input, processes each test case, and checks if the total bets (which is \( n \) if each bet is 1) are less than the minimum multiplier \( k_i \). If they are, it outputs a list of 1s; otherwise, it outputs -1. This logic ensures that the solution meets the problem requirements for every potential case.
