Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: For an array `a` of length `n`, the `x`-th cyclic shift is the array starting from the `x`-th element and wrapping around to the beginning.
3. **Objective**: Find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, return `-1`.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it processes the values of `n` and `k`.

1. **Case 1: `k >= 2`**
   - **Subcase 1: `n == k`**:
     - The program outputs an array of `k` identical elements, each equal to `k`. For example, if `n = k = 2`, it outputs `2 2`.
     - **Correctness Check**: This works because if all elements are the same, all cyclic shifts will be sorted. Thus, exactly `k` (which is `n` in this case) cyclic shifts will be sorted.
   - **Subcase 2: `n != k`**:
     - The program outputs `-1`.
     - **Correctness Check**: If `n != k` and `k >= 2`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. This is because if `n > k`, we cannot have exactly `k` sorted shifts without making more than `k` sorted (since having `n` identical elements is the only way to have `n` sorted shifts, and this is not allowed here). If `n < k`, it is also impossible since we cannot have more sorted shifts than the length of the array.
   
2. **Case 2: `k < 2`**
   - The program outputs an array of the first `n` natural numbers, i.e., `1, 2, ..., n`.
   - **Correctness Check**: This works because if `k = 1`, only the first cyclic shift (which is the array itself) will be sorted if the array is strictly increasing. If `k = 0`, no cyclic shift can be sorted, which is not a valid scenario as per the problem statement (since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1).
   
### Conclusion

- The program correctly handles the scenario where `k >= 2` and `n == k` by outputting an array of `n` identical elements.
- The program correctly handles the scenario where `k >= 2` and `n != k` by outputting `-1`.
- The program correctly handles the scenario where `k < 2` by outputting an array of the first `n` natural numbers, ensuring only one cyclic shift is sorted.

Hence, the program is correct.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
