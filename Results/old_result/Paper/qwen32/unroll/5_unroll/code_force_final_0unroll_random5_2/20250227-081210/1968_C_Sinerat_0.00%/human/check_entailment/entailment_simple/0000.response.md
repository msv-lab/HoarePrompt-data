### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by constructing the array `a` based on the provided array `x`. The program initializes `a[0]` to 500, which is a valid choice since `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), the program sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Let's verify if this approach satisfies the conditions:

1. **Initial Condition**: `a[0] = 500` is set, which is within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Subsequent Conditions**: For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This means that `a[i] mod a[i-1]` should be equal to `x[i]`:
   - `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`
   - `a[i] mod a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) mod a[i-1] = x[i-1] mod a[i-1]`
   - Since `x[i-1] < a[i-1]` (because `x[i]` is a remainder when `a[i]` is divided by `a[i-1]` and `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500`), `x[i-1] mod a[i-1]` simplifies to `x[i-1]`.

Therefore, the constructed array `a` satisfies the condition `a[i] mod a[i-1] = x[i]` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array `a` based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
