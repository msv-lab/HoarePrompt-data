In the given task, the for loop iterates over the `results` list. The loop head only contains the variable `i`, which will take on each element of the `results` list in turn. Therefore, the only state we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is the `results` list itself.

To ensure that the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The state of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is assigned the value of each element in `results` during each iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` has at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether the count of 'U' in the respective string `s` is odd.**
