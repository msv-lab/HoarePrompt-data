In the given for loop, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will iterate `t` times. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once.

Given the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The state of `t` directly affects whether the loop will execute, and since `_` is not something we need to adjust (it is just a placeholder), we only need to make sure `t` meets the condition for the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
