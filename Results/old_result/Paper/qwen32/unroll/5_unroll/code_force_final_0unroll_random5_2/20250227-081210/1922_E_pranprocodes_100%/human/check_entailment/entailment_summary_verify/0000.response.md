### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided program attempts to achieve this by using a binary representation approach, but the logic and implementation seem flawed as explained in the original assessment.

Let's break down the provided code and the function summary to see if the program meets the requirements:

1. **Binary Representation Approach:**
   - The code attempts to reduce `X` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 if it is even or subtracting 1 if it is odd.
   - It appends either a maximum or minimum value to the array based on whether `X` is even or odd, respectively.
   - The sequence of operations is then reversed and printed.

2. **Function Summary:**
   - The summary states that the function calculates the number of operations required to reduce `X` to 1 and outputs this count followed by the sequence of operations.
   - However, the summary does not specify how these operations translate into an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the binary representation approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - For example, the input `X = 3` should result in an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences, but the code's output does not meet this requirement.
   - Similarly, for `X = 6`, the expected number of increasing subsequences is 6, but the code's output does not achieve this.

4. **Flaws in the Code:**
   - The logic of appending max or min values based on the binary representation does not inherently ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
   - There is no mechanism to adjust the array structure to achieve the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of constructing an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`. The binary representation approach used in the code is flawed and does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Final: **False**
