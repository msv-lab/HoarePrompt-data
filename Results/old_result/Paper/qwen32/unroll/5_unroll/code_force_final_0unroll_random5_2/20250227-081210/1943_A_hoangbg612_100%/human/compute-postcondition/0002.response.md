To determine the output state after the execution of the provided loop, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `T` times. For each iteration, it reads an integer `S` and a list of integers `N`.

2. **Sorting and Initialization**:
   - The list `N` is sorted.
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - `M` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Processing the List**:
   - The code iterates through the sorted list `N`.
   - For each number `num` in `N`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`:
       - If `num` is more than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop.
       - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and adds `num` to the dictionary `M` with a count of 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   - After the loop, if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.

4. **Finding Unique Elements**:
   - It initializes an empty list `cnt`.
   - It iterates through the keys in `M` and appends the key to `cnt` if the count of the key is 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it sets `cur` to the second element of `cnt`.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `cur` is printed.

Given that the loop processes each test case independently and the state variables (`cur`, `M`, `cnt`) are re-initialized for each test case, the output state after all iterations will depend on the final value of `cur` for each test case.

Since the problem does not specify the exact input values for `T`, `n`, `S`, and `a`, we can describe the output state in a general form:

**Output State**: **The final value of `cur` for each of the `T` test cases, printed one per line.**

This output state reflects the final value of `cur` after processing each test case independently.
