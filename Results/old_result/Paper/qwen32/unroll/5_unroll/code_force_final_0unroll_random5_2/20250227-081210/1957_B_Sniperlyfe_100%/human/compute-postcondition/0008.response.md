Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the list to be returned and `k` is a non-negative integer. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and the remaining elements are filled with the remaining value of `k` distributed such that no element exceeds the value of the first element plus one. After distributing `k`, any remaining value is added to `nums[0]`.**
