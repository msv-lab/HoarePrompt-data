You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn the entire strip white.

The code identifies the first and last black cells in the string and calculates the length of the segment between these two cells. However, this approach does not guarantee that this segment is the minimum one required to cover all black cells.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3
BBW
3
BWB
3
WBB
```

Expected Output:
```
3
3
3
```

The provided code will output:
```
2
1
2
```

This is incorrect because in all three cases, the entire segment needs to be painted white to cover all black cells.

The correct approach would be to find the minimum segment that includes all black cells. This can be done by identifying the start of the first black cell and the end of the last black cell, which is essentially what the code does. However, the code does not handle cases where the black cells are not contiguous or when the entire segment needs to be painted.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        # Find the first and last black cell
        ind1 = s.find('B')
        ind2 = s.rfind('B')
        if ind1 == -1 or ind2 == -1:
            results.append(0)  # No black cells
        else:
            results.append(ind2 - ind1 + 1)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This code correctly identifies the minimum segment length that needs to be painted white to cover all black cells.
