### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string as per the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to decode a string `b` that was encoded by replacing each character in the original string `s` with its symmetric character in an auxiliary string `r`.
- The auxiliary string `r` is formed by taking all distinct characters from `s` and sorting them in alphabetical order.
- Each character in `r` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r` (first by last, second by second last, etc.).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program includes the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
3. It calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.
4. Inside `func_1(b)`:
   - It creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
   - It constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically based on the reverse order of the unique characters sorted in ascending order.
   - It constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` using the `char_map`.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary provided states:
- The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically based on the reverse order of the unique characters sorted in ascending order.

#### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the provided program is the incorrect construction of the `char_map`. The program maps each character in `r` to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should map each character in `r` to its symmetric character within `r`.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct mapping should be:
- For each character `r[i]` in `r`, the symmetric character is `r[-i-1]`.
- Therefore, `char_map[r[i]] = r[-i-1]`.

#### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of `func_1(b)`:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    r = sorted(set(b))
    for i, c in enumerate(r):
        char_map[c] = r[-i-1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

#### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it maps characters based on the entire alphabet rather than the positions within the auxiliary string `r`.

**Final: False**
