Functionality: **The function `func_2` modifies a list of non-negative integers by reducing certain elements based on specific conditions. It prints 'no' if any element at position `i-1` is not zero after a series of adjustments. If all elements at position `i-1` are zero, it calls another function `func_1` to determine if the final state of the list meets a certain condition, printing 'YES' if true and 'NO' if false. The final state of the program depends on the initial values of the list and the outcome of `func_1`.**
