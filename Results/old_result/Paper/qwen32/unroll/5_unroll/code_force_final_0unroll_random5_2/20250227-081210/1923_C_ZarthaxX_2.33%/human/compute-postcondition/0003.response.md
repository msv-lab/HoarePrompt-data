The code initializes a list named `sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, and `ones`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input for the current test case; `q` is the second integer read from the input for the current test case; `c` is a list of n integers where each integer c_i is such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer nums_i is such that 1 <= nums_i <= 10^9, and `nums` is equal to `c`; `ones` is a list of n + 1 integers, all set to 0; `sum` is a list of n + 1 integers, all set to 0.**
