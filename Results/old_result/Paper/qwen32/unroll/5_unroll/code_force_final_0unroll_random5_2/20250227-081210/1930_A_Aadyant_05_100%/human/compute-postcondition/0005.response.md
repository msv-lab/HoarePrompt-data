To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the given loop:

```python
for fin in final:
    print(fin)
```

The loop iterates over each element in the `final` list and prints it. Since the loop only includes a print statement, it does not modify the `final` list or any other variables outside of the loop.

Given the initial state, `final` is a list that contains the sum of the smaller numbers for each pair of integers in each test case. The loop will print each element of this list.

Therefore, the output state will be the printed values of each element in the `final` list.

Output State: **the printed values of each element in the `final` list.**
