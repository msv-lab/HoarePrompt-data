Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `list1`.

2. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The program attempts to transform the array into a sorted array using the specified operation.
   - The logic inside the loop is intended to split elements greater than 10 and insert their digits back into the array.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - The function `func_1` sorts the list and compares it to the original list to determine if it is sorted.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program only performs the splitting operation when the current element is greater than 10 and the previous element is greater than the current one.
   - However, the program only checks the condition `list1[p - 1] > list1[p]` and `list1[p - 1] > 10` once for each pair of elements.
   - If the condition is met, it performs the operation only once and then continues to the next pair.
   - The program does not re-check the entire array after performing the operation.
   - This means that the program might not fully transform the array into a sorted one if multiple operations are needed.

5. **Output**:
   - After attempting the transformation, the program checks if the array is sorted using `func_1` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program only attempts to perform the operation once per pair of elements and does not re-check the entire array after performing the operation.
- This can lead to cases where the array is not fully transformed into a sorted one, resulting in incorrect answers.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the transformation logic, the program is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation.

**Correctness: False**
