The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and there are four lines of input for each test case, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The variable `a` is introduced and assigned the value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is an input integer; For each of the t test cases, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
