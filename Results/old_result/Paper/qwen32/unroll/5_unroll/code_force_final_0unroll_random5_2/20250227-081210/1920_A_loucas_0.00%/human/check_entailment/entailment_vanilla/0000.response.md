Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then iterates `n` times to read each constraint, categorizing them into three lists:
     - `big` for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).
     - `less` for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
     - `no` for constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to x).

2. **Finding Valid Range:**
   - The code correctly identifies the smallest possible value for `k` that satisfies all constraints of type 1 using `max(big)`.
   - Similarly, it identifies the largest possible value for `k` that satisfies all constraints of type 2 using `min(less)`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers:**
   - The code then iterates over the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` (inclusive) and checks if each integer in this range is not in the `no` list.
   - If it finds an integer that is not in `no`, it sets `num` to this integer and breaks out of the loop.
   - However, this logic is incorrect because the problem asks for the count of all such integers, not just finding one such integer.

4. **Output:**
   - The code incorrectly outputs `num`, which is the first valid integer found, instead of the count of all valid integers.

### Correctness:
The code does not correctly solve the problem because it only finds and outputs one valid integer instead of counting all valid integers in the range that satisfy all constraints.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to count all integers in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` (inclusive) that are not in the `no` list.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()  # Use a set for faster lookup
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(big), min(less) + 1):
            if i not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)

# Call the function
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it outputs only one valid integer instead of counting all valid integers.

**Correctness: False**
