### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign must occur sequentially and each sign i occurs every a_i years.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case one by one.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year (`next_year`) using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign.
     - It effectively finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results for each test case, separated by newlines.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provide a state description at key points in the code, confirming that the program correctly processes each test case and calculates the year for each sign based on the periodicities.

#### Validation of the Calculation Formula:
The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is crucial for ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Let's break down the formula:
- `last_year + 1`: Ensures we are looking for the next occurrence after `last_year`.
- `a[i] - 1`: Ensures that we are looking for the next multiple of `a[i]` strictly after `last_year`.
- `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`: This part calculates the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

This formula is mathematically correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

#### Example Validation:
Let's validate the first example from the problem description:
- **Input:** `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Expected Output:** `36`
- **Calculation:**
  - `last_year = 3` (first sign)
  - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4` (second sign)
  - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8` (third sign)
  - `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10` (fourth sign)
  - `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18` (fifth sign)
  - `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36` (sixth sign)

The calculations match the expected output, confirming the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the given problem description and input constraints.

**Final:** **True**
