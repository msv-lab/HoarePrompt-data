In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. The loop variable is `num`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variable `n` and the loop variable `num`.

Given the loop:
```python
for num in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, `num` is the loop variable, and `n` is the upper bound of the range. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The initial value of `num` is not something we need to adjust before the loop starts because it is set by the `range` function during the first iteration.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that it is at least 1. The other variables (`a`, `count_a`, and `max_score`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that n >= 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `max_score` is 0**
