Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the described operation. The main issue lies in the logic used to check if splitting an element will help in sorting the array.

Here's a detailed explanation of the problem:

1. The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one, it attempts to split the previous element and checks if the resulting array (with the split element and the current element) is sorted.

2. However, the check `if nums != sorted(nums):` is insufficient. Just because the array `[arr[i-1], arr[i]]` is not sorted after splitting `arr[i-1]` doesn't mean it's impossible to sort the entire array. There could be other elements that, when split, would allow the array to be sorted.

3. The program also only considers splitting the previous element and does not consider other possible splits that might be necessary to sort the array.

4. The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed to sort the array.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
4
15 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- The array can be sorted by splitting `15` into `1` and `5`, resulting in the array `[1, 5, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Further splits are not needed, and the array can be sorted to `[1, 3, 4, 5, 5]`.

However, the provided program would incorrectly output `NO` for this input because it only checks the immediate neighbors and does not consider the possibility of multiple splits.

To correctly solve this problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as using a greedy algorithm to iteratively split elements and check if the array can be sorted.
