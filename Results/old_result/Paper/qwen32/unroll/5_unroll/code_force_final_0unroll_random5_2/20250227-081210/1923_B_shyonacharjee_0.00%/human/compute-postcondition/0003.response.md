Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `a` and `x` of length `n`. The list `a` contains integers between 1 and 10^9, and the list `x` contains distinct integers between -n and n (excluding 0) in strictly increasing order. The function processes these inputs and returns a value (or values) based on the given constraints for each test case.**
