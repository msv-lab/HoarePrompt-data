Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers representing the numbers on cards, and a parameter `k`, which is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange in each operation. The function returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and its value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.**
