Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. The program does not correctly count the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Instead, it attempts to find a single value of `k` that satisfies the constraints and then prints it, which is not the correct approach.

2. The program incorrectly initializes `num` to 0, which is not a valid value for `k` in this context. It then tries to find the first valid `k` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. However, it only breaks after finding the first valid `k` and prints it, which does not solve the problem of counting all valid `k`.

3. The program does not handle the case where there are no valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It should output `0` in such cases, but it may not correctly identify this scenario.

4. The program does not correctly handle the range of possible values for `k`. It should count all integers `k` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` (inclusive) that are not in `no`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        min_big = max(big)
        max_less = min(less)
        count = 0
        for k in range(min_big, max_less + 1):
            if k not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version properly counts all integers `k` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` (inclusive) that are not in `no`, and it handles the case where there are no valid `k` by outputting `0`.
