You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99. It decomposes integers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, rearranging them if necessary to ensure the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit. The function then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order. It appends 1 to a list `b` if the list is sorted, otherwise it appends 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. Let's break down some issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting Logic**: The program attempts to split numbers greater than 10, but it doesn't correctly handle the insertion of these digits back into the array. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should split `12` into `[1, 2]`, but it does not correctly insert these digits into the array while maintaining the order.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The code uses incorrect logic to compare and insert split digits. Specifically, the conditions `if y >= c[n - 1]` and `if y <= x` are not sufficient to ensure the array remains sorted after insertion of split digits.

3. **Lack of Proper Sorting Check**: The program checks if the final array `c` is sorted by comparing it with `sorted(c)`. However, the array `c` is constructed incorrectly due to the issues mentioned above, so this check is not meaningful.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
12 28 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- Split `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
- Split `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
- The array can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`, which is sorted.

However, the provided code will not correctly handle this case due to the issues in the logic for splitting and inserting digits.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
