You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):
            print(0)
            continue
        a.sort()
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        (i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
            if t2 > t1:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
            ans += max(t1, t2)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum possible sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of the two lists when elements are optimally paired. If all elements in both lists are the same, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it sorts one list in ascending order and the other in descending order, then computes the sum based on the specified pairing strategy.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of arrays `a` and `c` respectively.
   - It then reads the contents of arrays `a` and `c`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If both arrays `a` and `c` contain only one unique element and these elements are the same, the program outputs `0` because the maximum difference `D` is zero when both arrays are identical.
   - If `a` contains only one element, the program calculates the maximum difference by comparing this single element with the maximum and minimum elements of `c`.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - For cases where `a` has more than one element, the program aims to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `c` in descending order.
   - It initializes pointers `i` and `j` to `0` and `1` respectively, and `ans` to `0` to accumulate the total difference.
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and at each step compares the absolute differences between the smallest remaining element in `a` and the largest remaining element in `c` (`t1`), and between the largest remaining element in `a` and the smallest remaining element in `c` (`t2`).
   - It adds the larger of these two differences to `ans` and advances the pointer corresponding to the element that was used in the comparison.
   - The process continues until all elements of `a` have been paired with elements from `c`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the total difference `D` that was computed.

### Correctness Analysis

The approach taken by the program is sound. By sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order, it ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first, which is key to maximizing the total difference `D`.

- **Edge Cases:** The program correctly handles the case where both arrays are identical, and the case where `a` contains only one element.
- **General Case:** The strategy of comparing the smallest and largest remaining elements and choosing the larger difference ensures that the total difference `D` is maximized.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
