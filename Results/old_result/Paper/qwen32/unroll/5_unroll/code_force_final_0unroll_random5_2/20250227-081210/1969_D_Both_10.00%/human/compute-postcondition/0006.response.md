Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, which are lists of tuples. Each tuple in `main_ar` contains two integers where the first integer is the difference between `b_i` and `a_i`. Each tuple in `sec_arr` contains one integer, which is the `a_i` value. The function calculates an initial sum of all `a_i` values and adds to it the sum of `(b_i - a_i) + x_i` for all tuples in `main_ar` where `(b_i - a_i) + x_i` is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this calculated sum, referred to as `sub_summ`.**
