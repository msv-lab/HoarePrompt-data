Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where for each test case it receives two integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b`. The integer `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, each element `a_i` in list `a` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and each element `b_i` in list `b` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each, which is not specified in the provided information.**
