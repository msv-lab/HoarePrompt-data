Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` between 1 and 200,000, which represents the largest number Vladislav writes for that test case. The function returns the result for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
