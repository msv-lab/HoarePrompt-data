The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is initially 0, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The other variables `x_i`, `y_i`, and `s` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each of the t test cases, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i and y_i such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the last calculated value based on the formula for the last test case.**
