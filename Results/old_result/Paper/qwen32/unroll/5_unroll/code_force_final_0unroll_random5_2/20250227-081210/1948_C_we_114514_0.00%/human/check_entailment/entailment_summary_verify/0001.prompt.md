You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function determines for each test case whether the second row is reachable from the first row based on specific movement rules and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The robot is placed on a grid with 2 rows and `n` columns. The robot starts at position `(1, 1)`. Each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (`<`) or right (`>`). The robot can move in four possible directions (up, down, left, right) but must follow the arrow in the cell it lands on. The goal is to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the grid dimensions (`n`), and the two rows of the grid. It then calls the `func_1` function to determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Initial State**: The robot starts at `(1, 1)`. This is correctly represented in the logic by initializing `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
2. **Transition Logic**:
   - If the robot is on the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow points to the right (`>`):
       - If it's the last column (`j == n - 1`), it means the robot can move to the second row at the last column, setting `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the arrow points to the left (`<`):
       - The robot can't stay on the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
       - If there's an arrow pointing to the right in the same column on the second row, the robot can move down to the second row, setting `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the robot is on the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow points to the right (`>`):
       - If it's the last column (`j == n - 1`), the robot has reached the target, and `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.
3. **Result**: After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, the robot can reach the target, and the program outputs `YES`. Otherwise, it outputs `NO`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the transitions and checks if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. The program iterates through each column and updates the reachability states based on the arrows' directions. It correctly handles moving between rows and ensures the robot stays within grid boundaries.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
