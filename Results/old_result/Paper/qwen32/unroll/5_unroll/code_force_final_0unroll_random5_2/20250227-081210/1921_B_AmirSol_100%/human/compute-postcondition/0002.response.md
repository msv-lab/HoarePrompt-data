Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`.**
This means the program evaluates the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' (which is `cats_to_add`), and the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' (which is `cats_to_remove`). It then returns the larger of these two values.
