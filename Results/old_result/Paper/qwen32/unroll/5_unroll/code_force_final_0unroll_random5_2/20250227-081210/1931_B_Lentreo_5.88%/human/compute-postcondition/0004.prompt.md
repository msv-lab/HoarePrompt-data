You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the number of containers, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n and does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `nums`. It calculates a value `curr` by iterating through `nums` and adding the difference between each non-zero element and the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0 after processing all test cases, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The specific values of `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` are not preserved across test cases and are determined anew for each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of containers and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the amounts of water in the containers. It returns the average amount of water per container for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
