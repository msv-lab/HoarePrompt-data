Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher amount to one with a lower amount, but only in the direction from left to right (i.e., from a smaller index to a larger index).
2. **Constraints**:
   - The total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, ensuring that an equal distribution is theoretically possible.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, but only in the specified direction.

### Key Insight
The key insight is that to achieve an equal distribution, the cumulative water level (sum of water from the first container to the current container) should never be less than the cumulative target level (the sum of the target amount of water from the first container to the current container). If at any point the cumulative water level is less than the cumulative target level, it means there is not enough water to distribute equally up to that point, and thus, it's impossible to achieve the equal distribution.

### Program Analysis
Let's analyze the code provided:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the total amount of water `total` and checks if it's divisible by `n` (though this check is redundant since the problem guarantees it).
   - It calculates the target amount of water for each container `mean = total // n`.
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total `curr` of the difference between the current cumulative water and the cumulative target water.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means there's not enough water to distribute equally up to that point, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns 'YES'.

### Correctness
The logic in `func_1` is correct. The check `if curr < 0` ensures that at no point do we have less water than needed to achieve the equal distribution up to that point. If this condition is never met, then it is indeed possible to distribute the water equally.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same under the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
