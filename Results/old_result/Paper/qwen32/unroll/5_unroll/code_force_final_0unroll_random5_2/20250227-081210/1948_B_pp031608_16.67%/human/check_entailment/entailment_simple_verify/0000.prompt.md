You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the list represents the array a for a single test case with length n such that 2 <= n <= 50. The function will be called multiple times, each time with a new list representing a different test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^3.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in Loop Condition and Insertion**:
   - The loop iterates through the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and greater than 10. However, it only handles the case where the current element is greater than the next element and greater than 10 by splitting the current element into its digits. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of needing to split multiple elements or elements that are not adjacent but still cause the list to be unsorted.
   - The insertion of digits is done incorrectly. For example, if `list1[p - 1]` is 12, the code inserts `12 // 10` (which is 1) at `p - 1` and `12 % 10` (which is 2) at `p`. This should instead insert the digits '1' and '2' as separate elements, i.e., `list1[p - 1:p - 1] = [1, 2]`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted. However, the program only calls `func_1` once after attempting to make a single pass through the list. This is insufficient because the list might still be unsorted even after one pass, and multiple passes might be required to fully sort the list by splitting elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split, or where elements need to be split multiple times. For example, if the list is `[12, 34, 56]`, the program might only split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in `[1, 2, 34, 56]`, which is still unsorted.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Sorted Check**:
   - The program checks if the list is sorted after attempting to make a single pass. However, it does not ensure that the list is sorted after all possible splits have been made.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Continuously check and split elements until the list is sorted.
- Ensure that the digits of a split number are inserted correctly.
- Handle cases where multiple elements need to be split.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        new_a = []
        for x in a:
            if x >= 10:
                changed = True
                new_a.extend(int(digit) for digit in str(x))
            else:
                new_a.append(x)
        a = new_a
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This version of the program continuously splits elements until the list is sorted or no further splits are possible, ensuring that all potential cases are handled correctly.
