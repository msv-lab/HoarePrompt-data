### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not consider the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: The program needs to ensure that for any three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\), the following conditions must hold:
   \[
   2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}
   \]
   \[
   2^{a_j} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_i}
   \]
   \[
   2^{a_k} + 2^{a_i} > 2^{a_j}
   \]
   Since the lengths are powers of 2, the condition simplifies to checking if the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length. Given the nature of powers of 2, the only way three sticks can form a triangle is if the exponents satisfy \(a_i + a_j > a_k\) where \(a_i \le a_j \le a_k\).

2. **Counting Valid Combinations**: The provided program counts combinations based on the frequency of each exponent without considering the triangle inequality. It counts all combinations of three sticks without checking if they can form a triangle.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
   - Sort the exponents.
   - Use a three-pointer technique or a nested loop to check all combinations of three sticks and verify if they can form a triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary checks to ensure that the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

**Correctness: False**
