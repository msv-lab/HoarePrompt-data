Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the product n * k does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} each, representing the order of participants seen in a screenshot, where 1 <= a_{ij} <= n, and the first integer in each line is the author of the screenshot.**
