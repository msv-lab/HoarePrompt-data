The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints defined by pairs of integers. For each test case, it identifies and prints an integer that is greater than or equal to the maximum value associated with constraint type 1 and less than or equal to the minimum value associated with constraint type 2, while not being associated with constraint type 3.
