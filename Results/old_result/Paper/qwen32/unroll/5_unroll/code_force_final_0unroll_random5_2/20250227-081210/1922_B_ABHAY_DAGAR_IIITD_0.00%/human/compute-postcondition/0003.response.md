In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which represents each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

To ensure that the loop can execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The state of `result` doesn't need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it will be assigned the value of the first element in the `results` list during the first iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `results` is a list containing at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one computed result**
