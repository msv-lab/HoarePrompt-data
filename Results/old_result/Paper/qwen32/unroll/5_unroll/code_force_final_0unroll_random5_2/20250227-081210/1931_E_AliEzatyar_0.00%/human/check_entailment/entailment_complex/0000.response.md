### Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules. However, there are a few issues in the logic and implementation that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Function Name and Calls**: The function `func_1` is supposed to count trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, it is used incorrectly in the main loop where the numbers are not properly converted to strings before passing them to `func_1`. This would cause an error because `func_1` expects a string, not an integer.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `total_digits` and `subtract_zero`**:
   - `total_digits` is calculated as the total number of digits in all numbers in the list. This is correct.
   - `subtract_zero` is supposed to account for the leading zeros removed when Anna reverses numbers with trailing zeros. However, the logic is flawed. The program only considers the trailing zeros and subtracts them in pairs, which does not accurately represent the effect of Anna's moves on the total number of digits.

3. **Incorrect Winner Determination**:
   - The winner is determined based on the difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` compared to `m + 1`. However, this logic does not correctly model the game's rules and the optimal moves of both players. The game involves reversing digits and concatenating numbers, which can significantly change the total number of digits in ways that are not captured by simply counting trailing zeros.

4. **Typo in Output**: The output string for Sasha is misspelled as `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules and the optimal play of both players. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
