Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. However, there is a critical error in the handling of the "00:00" case. According to the problem description, "00:00" in 24-hour format should be converted to "12:00 AM" in 12-hour format. However, in the provided code, "00:00" is incorrectly converted to "12:00 PM". 

Additionally, the code uses a very repetitive and inefficient method to handle the conversion by checking each hour individually. This can be simplified using arithmetic and logical conditions to determine whether it is AM or PM and to convert the hour correctly.

Correctness: **False**
