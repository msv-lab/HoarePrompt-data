Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Name and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a number, but the name `func_1` is not descriptive and makes the code harder to understand.
   - The function `func_1` is called inside the loop, but its purpose is not clear from the context. The function seems to be trying to count trailing zeros, but it is not used correctly in the logic to determine the winner.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the winner is not correctly implemented. The program calculates the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros, but it does not correctly simulate the game's moves.
   - The program does not simulate Anna's move of reversing the digits of a number. Instead, it only counts trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the final number.
   - The program does not concatenate numbers as Sasha would do in his turn. It only checks the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of trailing zeros, which does not reflect the actual game mechanics.

3. **Incorrect Variable Name**:
   - The variable `subtract_zero` is used to accumulate the number of trailing zeros, but its name does not reflect its purpose clearly.
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules. The final number after all moves is not correctly calculated.

4. **Typographical Error**:
   - The output string for Sasha is incorrectly written as `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
- Anna can reverse either 14 to 41 or 2 to 2.
- If Anna reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than 10^2 = 100. Sasha wins.
- If Anna reverses 2 to 2, Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than 10^2 = 100. Sasha wins.
- The program, however, does not correctly simulate these moves and may incorrectly determine the winner.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
