You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct.

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, the code will print either 2 or 3 based on the conditions specified in the while loop. The variables n, l, i, and j will be reinitialized for each test case and do not retain their values between iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
- Monocarp wants to throw a party with at least 2 friends.
- Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i` (where `p_i != i` and all `p_i` are distinct).
- A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive an invitation.
- We need to find the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates over each test case and for each test case, it iterates over the list of best friends (`l`). It checks if there are two consecutive friends `i` and `i+1` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks the loop. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Logic Flaw**: The program checks for a very specific condition (`l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`) which is not necessarily the only way to have at least 2 friends come to the party.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Cases**: The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, in the second test case, the correct answer is `3`, but the program might not correctly identify this for all configurations.
3. **No General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution that works for all possible configurations of `p`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the smallest set of friends to invite such that at least two friends come to the party. This can be done by checking all possible pairs of friends and determining if inviting them will result in at least two friends coming to the party. A more systematic approach would involve graph theory, treating the problem as finding the smallest vertex cover in a graph where each edge represents a pair of friends and their best friends.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
