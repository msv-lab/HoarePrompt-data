You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically based on the reverse order of the unique characters sorted in ascending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string as per the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to decode a string `b` that was encoded using the described algorithm.
   - The encoding algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the mapping used during encoding.
   - We'll create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - For example, if `r` is "cdefors", 'c' maps to 's', 'd' maps to 'r', and so on.

3. **Steps in the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1(b)`, the program:
     - Creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
     - Constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
     - Constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` using the `char_map`.

4. **Correctness of the Mapping:**
   - The mapping created in `char_map` is incorrect. The symmetric character of a character `c` in `r` should be the character at the mirrored position in `r`, not the character at the mirrored position in the alphabet.
   - For example, if `r` is "cdefors", the correct mapping should be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'o'
     - 'f' -> 'n' (if 'n' were in `r`, but it's not in this example)
     - 'o' -> 'e'
     - 'r' -> 'd'
     - 's' -> 'c'
   - However, the program incorrectly maps each character to a character in the alphabet based on the length of `b`, which is not correct.

5. **Fixing the Mapping:**
   - The correct mapping should be based on the positions within `r`, not the entire alphabet.
   - The corrected mapping should be:
     - `char_map[r[i]] = r[-i-1]` for each character `r[i]` in `r`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it maps characters based on the entire alphabet rather than the positions within the auxiliary string `r`.

**Correctness: False**
