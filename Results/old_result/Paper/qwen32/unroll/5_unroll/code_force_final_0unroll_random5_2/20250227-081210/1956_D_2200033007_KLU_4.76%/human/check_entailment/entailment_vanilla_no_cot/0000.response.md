Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and outputs hardcoded results. It does not implement the required logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

Here is a brief explanation of what the program should do:
1. Compute the MEX of the subarray.
2. Perform the operation to set the subarray to the MEX value.
3. Repeat the process to maximize the sum of the array.
4. Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

The given program does not follow these steps and does not handle the general case correctly.
