Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard, followed by 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function processes up to 5000 such test cases and returns the result for each test case.**
