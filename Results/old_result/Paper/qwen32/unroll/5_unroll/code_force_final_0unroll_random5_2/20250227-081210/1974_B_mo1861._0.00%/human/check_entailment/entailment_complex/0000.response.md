### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The decoding process involves reversing the encoding steps. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process:

1. **Identify Unique Characters and Sort Them:**
   - The program identifies all unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them in ascending order to form the string `r`.

2. **Create a Mapping:**
   - It then creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character from the end of `r`. This is done by iterating over the sorted unique characters and mapping them to characters starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically in reverse order of the sorted unique characters.

3. **Decode the String:**
   - Finally, the program decodes the string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding mapped value from `char_map`.

However, there is a mistake in the implementation of the mapping step. The mapping should map each character in `r` to its symmetric character from the end of `r` directly, not to characters starting from 'a'. Here’s the correct approach:

- **Correct Mapping:**
  - For each unique character `c` in `r` at index `i`, map `c` to the character at index `len(r) - 1 - i` in `r`.

### Correct Implementation:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {r[i]: r[len(r) - 1 - i] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    return s
```

### Analysis of the Given Program:

The given program incorrectly maps the characters to a sequence starting from 'a', which does not match the encoding process described. Therefore, the program will not correctly decode the string `b` to the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:

Given the incorrect mapping logic, the program does not correctly decode the string `b` to the original string `s`.

**Correctness: False**
