Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective:**
   - Construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - Every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed as a sum of some subsequence of `a`.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The sequence `a` should be of size at most 25.
   - Valid inputs are given as `t` test cases, each with integers `n` and `k`.

3. **Approach:**
   - Use powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, ...) as initial elements of the sequence because they can form any sum through binary representation.
   - Adjust the sequence to avoid forming the sum `k` while ensuring all other sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) are possible.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The initial sequence `nums` is generated using the first 24 powers of 2 (`1 << i` for `i` from 0 to 23).
   - The program then finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` (denoted by `idx`).

3. **Adjusting the Sequence:**
   - The program removes the power of 2 at position `idx` from the sequence.
   - It then adds three new elements to the sequence:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed.
     - `k + 1`: This allows the sum `k + 1` to be formed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that sums greater than `k` can be formed.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the adjusted sequence and the sequence itself.

### Verification:
1. **Subsequence Sum `k`:**
   - By removing `nums[idx]` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, it is ensured that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence.

2. **Subsequence Sums Other Than `k`:**
   - The inclusion of `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` along with the remaining powers of 2 allows the formation of all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

3. **Sequence Size:**
   - The sequence size is at most 25, as it starts with 24 elements and adds up to 3 more elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) to be formed. The sequence size remains within the specified limit.

**Correctness: True**
