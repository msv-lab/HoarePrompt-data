### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of rotating the array to achieve a sorted order, which is a key requirement of the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to determine if there exists a point in the array where the order breaks such that rotating the array from that point results in a non-decreasing order. This involves checking if the array can be split into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and swapped to form a sorted array.

### Example Analysis:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - The array is not sorted, and no rotation can make it sorted. The program correctly identifies this and returns "No".

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - The array can be rotated to become `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted. The program incorrectly returns "No" because it does not check for possible rotations.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - The array is already sorted, so the program correctly returns "Yes".

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the point where the array stops being sorted.
2. Check if the array can be split and swapped to form a sorted array.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1` that implements this logic:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the point where the array stops being sorted
    break_point = -1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            break_point = i
            break
    
    # If no break point is found, the array is already sorted
    if break_point == -1:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Check if the array can be rotated to become sorted
    for i in range(break_point + 1, n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            return 'No'
    
    # Check if the last element is less than or equal to the first element
    if arr[n - 1] > arr[0]:
        return 'No'
    
    return 'Yes'
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the original program does not correctly implement the logic to check for possible rotations, the original assessment is accurate in identifying this flaw.

**Final: False**
