Reasoning:
The provided code is intended to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using the specified operation. The key part of the logic is in `func_2`, which iterates through the array and attempts to reduce the elements based on the given operation.

However, there is a critical issue in the implementation of `func_2`. Specifically, the line:
```python
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```
is incorrect. The operation described in the problem statement is:
- `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
- `a_i = a_i - 2`
- `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`

The current implementation incorrectly multiplies the adjustments by `list[i - 1]`, which is not part of the operation as described. This means the function is not correctly implementing the operation, and as a result, it may not correctly determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

Additionally, the function should print 'NO' if it finds that it cannot make all elements zero, but it should do so after attempting all possible operations. The current implementation might print 'NO' prematurely if it encounters a non-zero element at position `i-1` before trying all possible operations.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not properly implement the described operations and may not correctly determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

Correctness: **False**
