In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `inf` (which is defined as 200001). The loop head only involves the variable `i`, and the range is defined by the constants 1 and `inf`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the range allows for at least one iteration. Given the range `range(1, inf)`, the loop will execute as long as `inf` is greater than 1, which it is (since `inf` is 200001). Therefore, the loop will execute regardless of the current value of `i` before the loop starts, as long as `i` is less than `inf` when the loop begins.

The state of `t`, `n`, and `values` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, as they are not part of the loop head. However, since we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i`.

To ensure the loop starts correctly, `i` should be initialized to a value less than `inf` (200001). The most logical initial value for `i` would be 1, as the loop is intended to start from 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is a single integer for each test case, `values` is a list of 200001 elements all initialized to 0, `i` is 1**
