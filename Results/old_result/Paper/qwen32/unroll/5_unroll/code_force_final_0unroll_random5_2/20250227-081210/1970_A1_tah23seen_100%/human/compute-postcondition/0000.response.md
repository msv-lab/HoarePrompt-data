The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, the value of `n` will be a positive integer representing the length of the string `s`. The other conditions about `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**
