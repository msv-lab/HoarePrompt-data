The function `add(a, b)` is not related to the problem description provided. However, based on the problem description, the inputs are N and M which are integers representing the dimensions of the field (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd), the field itself which is a list of N strings where each string is a space-separated list of M pairs of characters representing the entities on the field, and T which is an integer representing the number of steps (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000). The actions are a list of T strings where each string describes an action performed by an entity on the field.
