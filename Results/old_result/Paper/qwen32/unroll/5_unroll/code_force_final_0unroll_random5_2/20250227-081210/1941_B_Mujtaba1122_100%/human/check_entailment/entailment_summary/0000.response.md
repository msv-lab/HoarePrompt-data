Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine if Rudolf can make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operation. Let's analyze the functions and their logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is not zero; otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented to check if the array is entirely zero.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the array using the given operation. It iterates through the array from the second element to the second-to-last element (inclusive).
   - For each valid `i`, it applies the operation while the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are met.
   - The operation modifies `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` by subtracting `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`, `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` from `list[i - 1]`.
   - If after the loop `list[i - 1]` is not zero, it prints 'no' and exits.
   - If the loop completes and all elements are zero, it calls `func_1` to confirm and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise 'NO'.

However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_2`:
- The operation logic is flawed. The current implementation subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`, `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` from `list[i - 1]`, which does not align with the problem description. The problem states that `a_{i - 1}` should be decreased by 1, `a_i` should be decreased by 2, and `a_{i + 1}` should be decreased by 1, not scaled by `list[i - 1]`.
- The logic to check if the operation can be applied properly is incorrect. The condition `list[i] > 1` and similar checks are not sufficient to determine if the operation can be applied correctly.
- The logic to print 'no' based on `list[i - 1]` not being zero is incorrect. It should be checking the entire array after attempting all possible operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
