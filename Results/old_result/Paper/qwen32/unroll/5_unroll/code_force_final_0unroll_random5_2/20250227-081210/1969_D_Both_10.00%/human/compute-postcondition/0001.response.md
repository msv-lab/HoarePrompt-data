The only variable in the loop head is `val_a`, which iterates over `sec_arr`. For the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one tuple. The state of `main_ar` and `sub_summ` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted according to the loop head.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers, `sec_arr` must have at least 1 tuple, `sub_summ` is 0**
