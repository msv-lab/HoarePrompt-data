Functionality: **The function takes an integer `n` and two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` as input. It calculates the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' (`cats_to_add`) and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' (`cats_to_remove`). It returns the maximum of these two counts.**
