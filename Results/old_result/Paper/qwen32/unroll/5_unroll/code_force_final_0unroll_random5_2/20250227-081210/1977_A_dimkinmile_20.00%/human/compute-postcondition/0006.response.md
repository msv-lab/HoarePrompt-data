Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
