### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and then reads `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It converts the input string of integers into a list and sorts this list.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list, picking every second element starting from the first element (which are the smallest elements due to sorting).
   - These selected elements are added to a list `list2`.
   - The sum of the elements in `list2` is computed and added to the output list `out`.

3. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the results for each test case stored in the `out` list.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Sorting:** The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This ensures that when it picks every second element, it is picking the smallest possible elements in each pair, thereby maximizing the sum of the minimum values of each pair.
  
- **Selection of Elements:** By picking every second element from the sorted list, the program ensures that it is always adding the minimum of each pair to the score. This is because, after sorting, the smallest elements are paired together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

- **Output:** The program correctly computes and prints the maximum score for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
