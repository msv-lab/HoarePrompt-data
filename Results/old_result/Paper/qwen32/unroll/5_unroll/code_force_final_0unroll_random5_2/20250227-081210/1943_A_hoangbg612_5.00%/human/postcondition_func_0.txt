The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer `cur` which represents the smallest integer such that the number of integers in the list `a` that are less than or equal to `i` is greater than `i` for all `i < cur`.
