The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each test case, the function accepts:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
  - `f`: an integer where 1 <= f <= n, representing a specific condition related to the list `a`.
  - `k`: an integer where 1 <= k <= n, representing another specific condition related to the list `a`.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.

The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified conditions for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified conditions for `f` and `k` related to the list `a`.**
