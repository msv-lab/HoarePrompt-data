Let's break down the code snippet and the variables step by step based on the given initial state.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\). This represents the length of the string `s`.
     - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`.
   - `inpstr` is assigned the value of `input()`. This means `inpstr` will be the string `s` for a given test case.
   - `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of `inpstr`.
   - `outind` is initialized to 0 (though it is not used in the provided print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)`.
   - `len(inpstr)` is the length of the string `s`, which is `n`.
   - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in the string `s`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in the string `s`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the number of characters between the first and last 'B' in the string `s`, excluding the 'B's themselves.
   - For example, if `s = "WWBBWWB"`, then:
     - `ind1` is 2 (index of the first 'B').
     - `ind2` is 5 (index of the last 'B').
     - `len(inpstr)` is 7.
     - The expression evaluates to `7 - 5 - 2 = 0`, meaning there are no characters between the first and last 'B'.

4. **General Case:**
   - The output will be the number of characters between the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, excluding the 'B's themselves.
   - If there is only one 'B' in the string, `ind1` and `ind2` will be the same, and the expression will evaluate to 0.

**Output:**
Output: **number of characters between the first and last 'B' in the string `s`, excluding the 'B's themselves**
