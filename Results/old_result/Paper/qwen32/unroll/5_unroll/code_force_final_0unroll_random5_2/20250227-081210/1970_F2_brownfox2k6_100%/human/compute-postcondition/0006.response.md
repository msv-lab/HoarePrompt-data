Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes a list of players and the position of a Bludger. It checks if any player is at the same position as the Bludger and, if so, marks that player as eliminated by setting their position to `[-1, -1]`. It then prints out the time step and the identifier of each eliminated player. The function does not return any value.**
