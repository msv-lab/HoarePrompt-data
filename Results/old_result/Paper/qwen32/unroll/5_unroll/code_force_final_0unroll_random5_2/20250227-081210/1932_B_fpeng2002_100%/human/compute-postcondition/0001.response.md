To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, let's analyze the loop condition and the given state.

The `while` loop statement is:
```
while num_tests > 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `num_tests` is greater than 0. The state right before the loop is given as:
- `num_tests` is an input integer.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6.

From the loop condition `num_tests > 0`, we need to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `num_tests` is described as an input integer, the only requirement we need to enforce is that this input integer must be greater than 0.

No other variables in the provided state (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed is:
State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**
