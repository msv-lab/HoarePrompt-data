Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operation. The function `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to perform the cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order with the minimum cost. It incorrectly calculates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0', which does not necessarily yield the minimum cost.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the minimum cost to transform the given binary string into a string of all '0's followed by all '1's. This can be achieved by calculating the cost of moving all '1's to the end of the string, considering the optimal cyclic shifts. The correct approach involves iterating through the string and calculating the cost based on the number of '1's that need to be moved past each '0'. However, the provided function does not implement this logic correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    ones = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            ones += 1
        elif i == '0' and ones > 0:
            cost += ones
    return cost

t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t -= 1
```

In this corrected version, the cost is incremented by the number of '1's encountered before each '0', which represents the number of cyclic shifts needed to move those '1's past the current '0'. This approach ensures that we are calculating the minimum cost to sort the string.
