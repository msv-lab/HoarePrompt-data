Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the score by performing `n` moves, where each move involves selecting two numbers from the list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both numbers from the list. The optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest available numbers since picking larger numbers would result in a lower score.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting and Pairing:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then iterates through the sorted list, picking every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ..., which are the smallest elements in each pair).

3. **Calculating Score:**
   - The selected elements are summed up to get the score for that test case.

4. **Output:**
   - The scores for all test cases are stored in a list and printed at the end.

### Correctness Verification

- **Sorting:** Sorting the list ensures that we are always picking the smallest available numbers first, which aligns with the optimal strategy.
- **Pairing:** By picking every second element from the sorted list, we are effectively pairing the smallest numbers together, which maximizes the sum of the minimums.
- **Output:** The scores are correctly calculated and output for each test case.

The program follows the optimal strategy and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
