Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are such that the first element of each tuple in `main_ar` is the difference between the corresponding `b_i` and `a_i` values, and `sec_arr` contains tuples where the first element is the `a_i` value. `sub_summ` is 0.**

This means that the variables `main_ar` and `sec_arr` retain their initial structure and values. The variable `sub_summ` has been initialized to 0.
