The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function determines if a specific condition is met within the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]` and prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 'NO'.
