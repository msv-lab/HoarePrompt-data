Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` where `n` is the number of vertices, `x` is the number of chosen vertices, and `y` is always 0. It also accepts a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
