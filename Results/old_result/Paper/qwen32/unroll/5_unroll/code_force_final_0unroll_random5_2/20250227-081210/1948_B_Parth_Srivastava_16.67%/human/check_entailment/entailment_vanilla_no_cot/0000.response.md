Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Splitting of Numbers**: The program attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their digits but does not handle all cases correctly. For instance, it only considers the last two digits and does not handle numbers with more than two digits.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic is flawed. The program does not correctly determine if the resulting array can be sorted after splitting. It only checks if the array is sorted after the first pass of splitting, which is insufficient.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where numbers are already sorted or where multiple splits are required to achieve a sorted array.

4. **Function Call Placement**: The function `func_1()` is called before the list `b` is initialized, which will result in an error.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_sort_by_splitting(arr):
    while True:
        new_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            if num >= 10:
                new_arr.extend(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
            else:
                new_arr.append(num)
        
        if new_arr == sorted(new_arr):
            return True
        
        if new_arr == arr:
            return False
        
        arr = new_arr

m = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_sort_by_splitting(a):
        results.append("YES")
    else:
        results.append("NO")

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected program repeatedly splits numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their digits until the array is sorted or no further splits can be made.
