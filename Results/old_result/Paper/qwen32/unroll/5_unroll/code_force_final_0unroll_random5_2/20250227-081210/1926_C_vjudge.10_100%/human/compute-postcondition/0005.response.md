The only variable in the loop head is `_` in the `range(t)`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The state of `values`, `t`, and `n` should be considered, but only `t` can be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The states of `values` and `n` do not need to be adjusted directly to make the loop execute, but they must remain as they are described in the initial state.

State: **`values` list will have each index `i` containing the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` remains unchanged**
