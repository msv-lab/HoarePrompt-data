### Reasoning:
The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the problem and the program's logic, and it correctly verifies the logic with the example provided. Here's a more systematic evaluation using the annotated code to ensure everything aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to `a[0]`, which is correct as the first sign occurs in the first multiple of its periodicity.

3. **Calculation of Next Occurrence**:
   - For each subsequent sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
   - This formula correctly finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is `>= (last_year + 1)`.
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` ensures that the calculation starts from the year immediately after the last sign occurred.
     - `// a[i] * a[i]` finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is `>= (last_year + 1)`.

4. **Updating `last_year`**:
   - After calculating `next_year`, the program updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results separated by newlines.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the logic with the first test case from the example:
- **Input**: `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- **Processing**:
  - First sign: `last_year = 3`
  - Second sign: `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
- **Output**: `36` (matches the expected result)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs for each test case. The annotations and the step-by-step processing in the original assessment align with the problem description and the program's behavior.

**Final: True**
