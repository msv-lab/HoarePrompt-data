The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 for each test case. After the execution of this code, `n` will hold the value of the integer input provided by the user. The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer input provided by the user such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**
