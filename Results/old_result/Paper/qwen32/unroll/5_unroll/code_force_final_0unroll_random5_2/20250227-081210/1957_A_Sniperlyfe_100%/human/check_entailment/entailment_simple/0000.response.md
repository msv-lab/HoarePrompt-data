Reasoning: 

The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, with each side of the polygon being formed by exactly one stick. The key observation is that a regular polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length. Therefore, for each unique stick length, the number of polygons that can be formed is determined by the integer division of the count of sticks of that length by 3.

However, the provided function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3. This approach assumes that each polygon is a triangle, which is not necessarily the case. The problem description does not specify the number of sides for the polygons, only that they are regular and equal-sided. 

Since the function does not account for polygons with more than 3 sides, it will not yield the correct result for test cases where polygons with more than 3 sides can be formed. For example, in the fourth test case of the provided example, the function would not correctly identify that a pentagon (5 sides) and a square (4 sides) can be formed.

Therefore, the logic of the function `func_1` is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
