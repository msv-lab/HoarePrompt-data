### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the field dimensions `(n, m)`.
   - It then reads the field configuration, storing the positions of red goals (`rg`), blue goals (`bg`), the Quaffle (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and players (`player`).
   - It initializes `carry` to `None` (indicating no player is carrying the Quaffle), and `bs` and `rs` to `0` (scores for blue and red teams, respectively).

2. **Processing Actions:**
   - The program iterates through each action. For each action, it reads the entity and the direction or action type.
   - **Catch (`C`):** If the action is `C`, it sets `carry` to the player identifier.
   - **Throw (`T`):** If the action is `T`, it sets `carry` to `None` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If so, it updates the score, prints the goal event, and resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field.
   - **Movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`):** If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, it calls `func_1` to update its position. If the entity is a player, it also calls `func_1` to update its position, and then checks if the player is carrying the Quaffle. If so, it updates the Quaffle's position.
   - After each movement, it calls `func_2` to check if any player is at the same position as the Bludger. If so, it eliminates the player and prints the elimination event.

3. **Functions:**
   - **`func_1`:** This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`). It correctly handles all four directions: `U`, `D`, `L`, `R`.
   - **`func_2`:** This function checks for any player at the Bludger's position and marks them as eliminated. It prints the elimination events in alphabetical order.

4. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all actions, the program prints the final score.

### Checking against the provided examples:
- **Example 1:**
  - The red player scores in the blue goal, resulting in `BLUE GOAL` and `FINAL SCORE: 0 1`.
- **Example 2:**
  - The red player scores in their own goal, resulting in `BLUE GOAL` and `FINAL SCORE: 0 1`.
- **Example 3:**
  - Both players are eliminated by the Bludger, resulting in `R0 ELIMINATED`, `B0 ELIMINATED`, and `FINAL SCORE: 0 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all the specified actions and rules correctly, producing the expected output for the provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
