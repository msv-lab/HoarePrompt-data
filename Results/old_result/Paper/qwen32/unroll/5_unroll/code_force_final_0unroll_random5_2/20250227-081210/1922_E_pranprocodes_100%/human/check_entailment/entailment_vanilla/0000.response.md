Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to construct an array of integers such that the number of its increasing subsequences equals a given number \( X \). The key is to understand how the number of increasing subsequences is generated by the structure of the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a greedy approach to generate an array based on the binary representation of \( X \). Here is a detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `max` and `min` to large positive and negative values, respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `ans` to store the array and a counter `t` to keep track of the length of the array.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues until \( X \) becomes 1.
   - If \( X \) is even, it appends `max` to the array, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
   - If \( X \) is odd, it appends `min` to the array, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - This process effectively converts \( X \) into a binary representation, where each bit corresponds to an element in the array.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - After the loop, the array `ans` is reversed. This step is crucial because the binary representation is constructed in reverse order.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the array `t` is printed.
   - The elements of the array `ans` are printed.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program attempts to generate an array based on the binary representation of \( X \), but it does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly \( X \).
- The key issue is that the program does not correctly map the binary representation to the number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the binary representation does not inherently correspond to the number of increasing subsequences in a way that guarantees the correct count.
- For example, if \( X = 5 \), the binary representation is `101`. The program would generate an array like `[min, max, min]` (or similar), but this does not necessarily result in exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
- The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to construct the array, such as using a combination of elements that generate the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It attempts to use a binary representation to generate the array, but this approach does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
