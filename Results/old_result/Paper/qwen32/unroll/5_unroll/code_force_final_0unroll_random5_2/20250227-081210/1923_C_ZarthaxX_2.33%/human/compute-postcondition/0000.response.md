The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers representing the number of elements in the list `c` and the number of queries, respectively. The list `c` and the queries are not affected by this code snippet.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `q` are updated to the integers read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `c`, and the queries) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input for the current test case; `q` is the second integer read from the input for the current test case; `c` is a list of n integers where each integer c_i is such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
