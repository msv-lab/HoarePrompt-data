The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `test_cases`. The `results` list is now ready to store values that might be appended to it in subsequent code (not provided here).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and two strings of length n. n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each string consists of characters '<' and '>' only. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**
