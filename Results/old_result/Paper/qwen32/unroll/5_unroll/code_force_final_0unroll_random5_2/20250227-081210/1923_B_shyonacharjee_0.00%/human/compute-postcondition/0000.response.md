Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9; `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `x_i` is an integer such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer input by the user, while all other variables (`n`, `k`, `a_i`, `x_i`) retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
