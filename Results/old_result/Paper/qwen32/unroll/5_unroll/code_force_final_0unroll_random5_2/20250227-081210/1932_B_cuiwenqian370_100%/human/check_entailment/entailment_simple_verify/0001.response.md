Let's evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The Chaya tribe believes in n signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every a_i years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the i-th sign must occur strictly after the (i-1)-th sign.
- The goal is to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, marking the apocalypse.

### Program Code Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of signs `n`.
2. Reads the list of periodicities `a`.
3. Initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
4. Iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next occurrence year (`next_year`) using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, ensuring that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` greater than `last_year`.
5. Updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.
6. Collects the final `last_year` for each test case and prints the results.

### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points:
- The input is read and split into a list of strings.
- The number of test cases `T` is correctly parsed.
- For each test case, `n` and the list `a` are correctly parsed.
- The calculation of `next_year` ensures that it is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` greater than `last_year`.
- The final `last_year` is appended to the results list for each test case.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is correct because:
- It reads and processes the input correctly.
- It calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which ensures the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- It handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct results based on the problem description.

### Evaluation:
The original assessment appears accurate. Let's verify the logic with an example:

#### Example Verification:
Consider the first test case from the problem description:
- `n = 6`
- `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`

**Step-by-step Calculation:**
1. `last_year = a[0] = 3`
2. For `i = 1`:
   - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
   - `last_year = 4`
3. For `i = 2`:
   - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
   - `last_year = 8`
4. For `i = 3`:
   - `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
   - `last_year = 10`
5. For `i = 4`:
   - `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
   - `last_year = 18`
6. For `i = 5`:
   - `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
   - `last_year = 36`

The final `last_year` is 36, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on the given problem description and handles multiple test cases accurately. The logic and calculations are verified through the annotations and an example.

**Final: True**
