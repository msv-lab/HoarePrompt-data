To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the loop:

The loop iterates `n` times, and during each iteration, it checks if the current element of `arr` (at index `i`) is equal to `k`. If it finds a match, it updates the variable `pos` with the current index `i`.

If `k` is found in the array `arr`, `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain `-1`.

The variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `st` are not modified within the loop, so they will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range within the array, and `st` is a set used to store midpoints during the binary search process.**
