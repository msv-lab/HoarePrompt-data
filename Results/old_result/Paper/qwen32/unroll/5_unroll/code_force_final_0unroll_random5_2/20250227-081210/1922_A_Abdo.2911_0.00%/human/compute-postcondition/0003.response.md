Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function returns a specific output based on the given strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
