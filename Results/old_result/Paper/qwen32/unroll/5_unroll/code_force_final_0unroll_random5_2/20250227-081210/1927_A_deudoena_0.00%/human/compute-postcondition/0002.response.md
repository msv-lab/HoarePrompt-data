The code snippet provided only initializes `ind2` to 0. No other variables are affected or changed by this code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state except for `ind2`, which is now assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`; `inpstr` is assigned the value of `input()`; `ind1` is 0; `ind2` is 0.**
