#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 0 <= a_i <= 99.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99. It decomposes integers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, rearranging them if necessary to ensure the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit. The function then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order. It appends 1 to a list `b` if the list is sorted, otherwise it appends 0.
