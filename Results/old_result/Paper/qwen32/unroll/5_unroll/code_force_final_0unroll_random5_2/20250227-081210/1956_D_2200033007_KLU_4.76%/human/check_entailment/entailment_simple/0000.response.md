Reasoning: 
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum sum of the array and the sequence of operations required to achieve that sum. The function `func_1` only checks if the length of the array is 2 and prints a hardcoded result for that case. For any other length, it prints a hardcoded result of `13 0`, which is not necessarily the correct maximum sum for those cases. This approach fails to consider the actual values in the array and the possible operations to maximize the sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
This shows that the program does not correctly compute the maximum sum or the sequence of operations for arrays of length other than 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
