You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a list a of length n with integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n with integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. Each test case within `arr` remains in its original form but the order of test cases is reversed based on their lexicographical order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case is a list containing an integer `n`, a list `a` of length `n` with integers in non-decreasing order, and a list `b` of length `n` with integers in non-decreasing order. The function returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order based on the lexicographical order of the test cases, while each test case remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. Each test case within `arr` remains in its original form but the order of test cases is reversed based on their lexicographical order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
