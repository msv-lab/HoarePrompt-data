You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if we can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n - 1\)) and perform the following changes:
- \(a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1\)
- \(a_i = a_i - 2\)
- \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1\)

We need to apply this operation any number of times and check if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program iterates through each test case and for each array, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of elements \(n\) in the array.
2. Reads the array elements.
3. Iterates through the array from the first element to the third last element (i.e., from index 0 to \(n-3\)).
4. For each element at index \(i\), it attempts to reduce the elements at \(i+1\) and \(i+2\) based on the value of the element at \(i\). Specifically, it subtracts twice the value of the element at \(i\) from the element at \(i+1\) and subtracts the value of the element at \(i\) from the element at \(i+2\). It then sets the element at \(i\) to zero.
5. If at any point an element becomes negative, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop for that test case.
6. If the loop completes without breaking, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Element Reduction**: The program assumes that it can always reduce the elements at \(i+1\) and \(i+2\) by the values calculated, without checking if these elements have enough value to be reduced. This is incorrect because the operation can only be applied if the elements at \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) have sufficient values to be reduced by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
2. **No Consideration for Remaining Elements**: The program only checks the last two elements after the loop. This is not sufficient because the operation can be applied to reduce elements in the middle of the array, and the program does not account for this.
3. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**: The program checks for negative values during the reduction process, but this check is not sufficient to determine if the operation can be applied correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if we can reduce all elements to zero using the given operation. A correct approach would involve checking if the array can be reduced to zero by ensuring that at each step, the elements can be reduced according to the operation rules.

Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
