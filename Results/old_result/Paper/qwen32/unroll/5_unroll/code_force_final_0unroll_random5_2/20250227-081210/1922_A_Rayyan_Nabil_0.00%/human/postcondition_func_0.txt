The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if every character in string `c` matches at least one of the corresponding characters in strings `a` or `b`. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met for all characters in `c` for a given test case, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
