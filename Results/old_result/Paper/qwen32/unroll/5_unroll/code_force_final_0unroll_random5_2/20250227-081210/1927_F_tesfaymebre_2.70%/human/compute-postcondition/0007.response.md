The code snippet changes the color of the vertex `curr` from 1 to 2. The values of `curr`, `parent`, `path`, and the color of other vertices remain unchanged. The condition for returning a path during the DFS and the termination of the loop based on finding a path containing `node_v` are still valid.

Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the depth-first search with `curr` appended to it, and the color of the vertex `curr` is 2. If a path containing `node_v` is found during the DFS, it is returned and the loop terminates early. Otherwise, the loop completes without returning a path.**
