Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of positive integers. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns the tuple `(0, 0)`. The function modifies the `sequence` list by appending additional numbers based on certain calculations, but the final return value is consistently `(0, 0)`.**
