You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' corresponding to each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, an integer `f` indicating the position of a favorite element in the list, and an integer `k`. It also receives a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then determines whether there are at least `k` elements in the list that are greater than the favorite element, or if the total of elements greater than or equal to the favorite element is less than or equal to `k`. Based on these conditions, it prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list `a` of `n` integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Identify the Favorite Cube:**
   - The program correctly identifies the value of the favorite cube using `favorite_value = a[f - 1]`.

3. **Count Cubes with the Same Value:**
   - It counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube using `same_value_count`.

4. **Count Cubes with Greater Value:**
   - It counts how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube using `greater_count`.

5. **Determine the Removal Status:**
   - If `greater_count >= k`, it means there are enough cubes with greater values to fill the first `k` positions, so the favorite cube will definitely be removed. Hence, it prints "YES".
   - If `greater_count + same_value_count <= k`, it means even if all cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube are considered, they do not fill the first `k` positions, so the favorite cube will definitely not be removed. Hence, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE", indicating that the favorite cube might or might not be removed depending on the exact arrangement of the cubes with the same value.

The logic correctly handles all possible scenarios based on the problem description. Here are some edge cases considered:
- When `k` is greater than or equal to the total number of cubes (`n`), the favorite cube will always be removed.
- When `k` is 0, the favorite cube will never be removed.
- When there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite cube, the program correctly accounts for them.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct.
