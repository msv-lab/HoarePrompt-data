To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to carefully analyze the provided code and how it manipulates the variables.

Let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   - `n` is the number of nodes.
   - `m` is the number of edges.
   - `k` is an integer used in the final summation.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus for competitive programming to prevent integer overflow.
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo `M`. This value is used in the final summation.
   - `s` is initialized to 0. It will store the final result.
   - `a` is initialized to 0. It will accumulate the sum of `f_i` values for each edge.

3. **Processing Edges:**
   - For each edge, the values `u`, `v`, and `f` are read.
   - The value of `a` is incremented by `f`.

4. **Final Summation:**
   - The loop runs `k` times. In each iteration, `s` is updated using the formula:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
     Simplifying, this becomes:
     \[
     s = s + c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
   - After the loop, `s` is printed modulo `M`.

5. **Output:**
   - The output for each test case is the value of `s` modulo `M`.

### Output State Calculation:

The final value of `s` for each test case is determined by the summation inside the loop. Let's derive the formula for `s`:

\[
s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a \right)
\]

This can be split into two sums:

\[
s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i + c \cdot a \cdot k
\]

The sum of the first `k` integers is given by:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = \frac{(k-1)k}{2}
\]

Thus, the formula for `s` becomes:

\[
s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k
\]

### Final Output State:

For each test case, the output state is the value of `s` modulo `M`.

Output State: **For each test case, the output is \((c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k) \% M\).**
