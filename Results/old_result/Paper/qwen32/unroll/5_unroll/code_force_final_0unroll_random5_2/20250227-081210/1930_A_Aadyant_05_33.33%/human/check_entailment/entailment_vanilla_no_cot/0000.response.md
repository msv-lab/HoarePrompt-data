To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting and Selection:**
   - The integers are sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then selects every second integer from the sorted list starting from the first one (index 0, 2, 4, ...), which corresponds to the smallest integers.
   - These selected integers are summed to get the score for each test case.

3. **Output:**
   - The scores for all test cases are printed.

The strategy used in the program is optimal for the problem at hand. By sorting the list and always picking the smallest available integers in pairs, the program ensures that the sum of the minimum values of each pair is maximized.

Let's verify the code with the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `1`, `2 3`
  - Sorted: `2 3`
  - Selected: `2`
  - Score: `2`

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `2`, `1 1 2 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
  - Selected: `1 1`
  - Score: `2`

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `3`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Selected: `1 1 1`
  - Score: `3`

The program correctly computes the expected scores for all test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
