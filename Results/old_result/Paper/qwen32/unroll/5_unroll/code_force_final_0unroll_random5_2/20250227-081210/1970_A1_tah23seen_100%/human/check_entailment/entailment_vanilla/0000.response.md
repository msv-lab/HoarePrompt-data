Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by taking a single input string `n` which consists of the characters '(' and ')'.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` with this input string.

2. **Function `func_1` Explanation:**
   - Inside `func_1`, it calculates the length of the string `s` and initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized with the key `0` and value `0` to keep track of the prefix balances.
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is '(', it increments the balance by 1 for the next position.
     - If the character is ')', it decrements the balance by 1 for the next position.
   - The dictionary `d` will contain the balance of the prefix up to each position in the string.
   - The last entry in the dictionary (which corresponds to the balance after the entire string) is removed using `d.pop(n)`.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values in increasing order. If two prefix balances are the same, it sorts by the position in decreasing order (achieved by `-x[0]` in the lambda function).
   - After sorting, it constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` in the order determined by the sorted positions.

3. **Output:**
   - The sorted positions and their corresponding characters form the balanced shuffle sequence, which is then printed.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of Prefix Balance Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position in the input string.

- **Sorting Logic:**
  - The sorting is done according to the rules specified in the problem: increasing order of prefix balance and, for ties, decreasing order of position. This ensures that the resulting sequence maintains the balance condition.

- **Result Construction:**
  - The final sequence is constructed by appending characters from the original string in the order determined by the sorted positions, which aligns with the balanced shuffle operation.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the prefix balances, sorts them according to the specified rules, and constructs the final balanced shuffle sequence.

**Correctness: True**
