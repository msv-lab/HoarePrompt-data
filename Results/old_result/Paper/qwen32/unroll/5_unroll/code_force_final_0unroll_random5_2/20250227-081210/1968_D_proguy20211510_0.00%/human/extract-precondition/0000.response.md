Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The permutation p is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
