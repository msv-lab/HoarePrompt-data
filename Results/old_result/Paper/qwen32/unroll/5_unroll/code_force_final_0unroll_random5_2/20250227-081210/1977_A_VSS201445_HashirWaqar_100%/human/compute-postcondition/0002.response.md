The function `func` accepts an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100. For each of the following `t` lines, it receives two integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided `n` and `m` values for each line. The specific return value for each pair of `n` and `m` is not detailed in the given constraints and relationships, but it is implied that the function will output something for each pair.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and processes `t` pairs of integers `n` and `m`, returning a result for each pair.**
