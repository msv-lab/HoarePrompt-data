Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issue.

The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to get `vprod`. It then checks if the difference between `prod` and the sum of `vprod` is greater than 0. If not, it returns -1. Otherwise, it prints `vprod`.

However, the logic for determining the bets (`vprod`) is flawed. The bets should be such that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the product of the sum of bets and each multiplier. The current implementation does not guarantee this condition for all cases.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```
or any other valid distribution like `2 1 1`, `1 2 1`, `1 1 2`, etc., as long as the sum of bets is less than the product of the sum of bets and each multiplier.

**Program Output:**
```
2 2 2
```

Explanation for the counterexample:
- The product of multipliers (`prod`) is `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.
- `vprod` is calculated as `[4, 4, 4]` (since `prod // r` for each `r` is `8 // 2 = 4`).
- The sum of `vprod` is `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.
- The condition `prod - sum(vprod) > 0` is `-4 > 0`, which is false, so the program returns `-1`, which is incorrect.

The correct distribution should ensure that the total bets are less than the product of the sum of bets and each multiplier. The current implementation does not guarantee this and can return incorrect results or `-1` when valid distributions exist.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
