The given code snippet initializes a variable `prod` to 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `vals`, `N`, and the list `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `N` is an integer read from the input. `vals` is a list of integers read from the input. `prod` is 1.**
