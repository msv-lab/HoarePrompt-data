list is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the elements of the array for each test case, and the length of list is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each integer in the sublists is between 0 and 10^9, inclusive. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
