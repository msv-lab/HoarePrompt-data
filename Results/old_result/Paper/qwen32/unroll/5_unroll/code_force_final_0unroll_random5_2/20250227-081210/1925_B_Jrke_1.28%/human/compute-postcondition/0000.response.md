In the provided for loop, the only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable, and `int(input())` which determines the number of iterations. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. However, since the loop is dependent on the input provided during runtime, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input should be a positive integer.

Given the context, the only state that can be adjusted according to the loop head is the input value. The variables `t`, `x`, and `n` are mentioned in the problem description but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, input value must be a positive integer**
