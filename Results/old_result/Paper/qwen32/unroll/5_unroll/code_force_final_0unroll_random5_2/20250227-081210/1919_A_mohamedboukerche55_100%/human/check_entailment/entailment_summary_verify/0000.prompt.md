You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, and prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy. The logic in the program is to check if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, and then declare Bob as the winner if the sum is even and Alice as the winner if the sum is odd. However, this logic does not consider the game dynamics and the optimal moves that Alice and Bob can make.

Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Test Case: `a = 1`, `b = 1`**
   - According to the program, the sum is `2`, which is even, so the output is `Bob`.
   - However, the correct output should be `Bob` because Alice cannot make a move after taking one coin from her wallet, and Bob loses.

2. **Test Case: `a = 1`, `b = 4`**
   - According to the program, the sum is `5`, which is odd, so the output is `Alice`.
   - The correct output is `Alice` because Alice can swap wallets with Bob, then Bob will have 1 coin and Alice will have 4 coins. Bob will then have to take a coin, leaving Alice with 4 coins and Bob with 0 coins. Alice can then take a coin, leaving Bob with 0 coins and Alice with 3 coins. Bob cannot make a move, and Alice wins.

3. **Test Case: `a = 5`, `b = 3`**
   - According to the program, the sum is `8`, which is even, so the output is `Bob`.
   - The correct output is `Bob` because Alice can swap wallets with Bob, leaving Alice with 3 coins and Bob with 5 coins. Bob can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 3 coins and Bob with 4 coins. Alice can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 2 coins and Bob with 4 coins. Bob can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 2 coins and Bob with 3 coins. Alice can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 1 coin and Bob with 3 coins. Bob can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins. Alice can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 0 coins and Bob with 2 coins. Bob can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 0 coins and Bob with 1 coin. Alice cannot make a move, and Bob wins.

The program does not implement the optimal strategy for both players, and thus does not correctly determine the winner for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
