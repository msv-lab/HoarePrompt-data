Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Separation of Letters and Digits**: The program iterates through each character of the password and separates them into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits. This is essential for checking the sorting conditions separately for letters and digits.

2. **Sorting Check**: 
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it also returns 'NO'.

3. **Digit After Letter Check**: The program then iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Final Check**: If all the above checks pass, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The provided states in the annotated program accurately reflect the conditions checked by the program, and the logic is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
