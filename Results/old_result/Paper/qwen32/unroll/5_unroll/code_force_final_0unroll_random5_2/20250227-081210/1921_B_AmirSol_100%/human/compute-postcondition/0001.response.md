Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1', `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `cats_to_remove` is calculated as the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. The values of `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `cats_to_add` remain unchanged.
