The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is non-zero. Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `n` is an input integer, we need to specify that `n` must be non-zero for the loop to run. The states of `t`, `x_i`, `y_i`, and `s` do not affect the execution of the `while` loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each of the t test cases, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i and y_i such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000; `n` must be non-zero; `s` is the last calculated value based on the formula for the last test case.**
