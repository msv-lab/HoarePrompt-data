Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the construction of the `char_map` dictionary. The program maps each unique character in the encoded string `b` to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically, which is not the intended behavior.

According to the problem, the decoding should map each character in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted set of unique characters `r`. This means that the first character in `r` should map to the last character in `r`, the second character in `r` should map to the second-to-last character in `r`, and so on.

The current implementation incorrectly maps the first unique character in `b` to 'a', the second to 'b', and so forth, which is the opposite of what is required for decoding.

To fix the program, the mapping should be created such that the first character in the sorted set of unique characters `r` maps to the last character in `r`, the second maps to the second-to-last, and so on.

Correctness: **False**
