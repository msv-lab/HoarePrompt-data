### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the correctness of the program step-by-step.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a valid starting point because the MEX of an empty set is `0` and it can only increase as elements are added.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.
   - The logic for updating `mex` is incorrect. The `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p` up to that point. However, the current logic might incorrectly update `mex` to a value that is already present in `p`, which would violate the MEX property.

3. **Handling of Negative Values**:
   - If `a[i]` is negative, `p[i]` could be greater than `mex`, which would not satisfy the MEX property. The program does not handle this correctly.

4. **Ensuring Uniqueness**:
   - The program does not ensure that the constructed `p` is a permutation, i.e., all elements from `0` to `n-1` must be present exactly once.

### Example to Show Incorrectness

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:

```
1
3
-1 0 1
```

The program will construct `p` as follows:
- For `i = 2`, `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 3 - 1 = 2` and `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 1`, `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 0 = 2` and `mex = min(2, 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 0`, `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 2 - (-1) = 3` and `mex = min(2, 3) = 2`.

The constructed `p` is `[3, 2, 2]`, which is not a valid permutation because it contains duplicate values and a value outside the range `[0, 2]`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and does not ensure that the constructed `p` is a valid permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
