Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and deleting them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to array `c` while Bob does not.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of array `c`.

2. **Objective**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - Both play optimally.

3. **MEX Definition**:
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to simulate the game and determine the final MEX of `c`:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted. This step seems unnecessary for the optimal strategy but does not affect correctness.

3. **Counting and MEX Calculation**:
   - It initializes `cur` to `-1` and an empty dictionary `M`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `a`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M`.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals `n`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from `0` to `cur` and checks if the count of any number `i` is less than or equal to `i`. If such a number is found, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX of `c`.

### Correctness Evaluation

The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game dynamics. The optimal strategies for Alice and Bob involve more than just counting occurrences and sorting the array. Here are the key issues:

1. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should aim to add numbers to `c` in a way that maximizes the MEX.
   - Bob should aim to prevent Alice from adding numbers that would increase the MEX.
   - The provided solution does not consider the strategic choices of both players.
   
2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The logic for determining the MEX based on counts and sorting is flawed. It does not account for the alternating turns and the strategic removal of elements by Bob.
   - The solution does not correctly simulate the game, especially the strategic moves of both players.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided solution, it is incorrect for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
