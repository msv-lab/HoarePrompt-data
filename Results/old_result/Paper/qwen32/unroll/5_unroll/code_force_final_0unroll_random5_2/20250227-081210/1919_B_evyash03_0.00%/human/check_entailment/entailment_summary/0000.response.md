Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program seems to be trying to count the number of times the balance of '+' and '-' characters goes negative or if there's a positive balance left, but it does not calculate the penalty as defined.

The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray. The provided code does not split the array into subarrays and calculate the penalty for each subarray. Instead, it only counts the number of times the balance goes negative or checks if there's a positive balance left, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.

Let's consider the third test case from the example:
- Input: `+-+-+-`
- Expected output: `0`
- The optimal split is `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` which results in penalties of `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

The provided code would not produce this output. It would count the number of times the balance goes negative or if there's a positive balance left, which would not yield the minimum penalty.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
