Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines follow, each with three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i` representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Objective:**
   - Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.
   - Compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Key Points:**
   - For each pair of friends, their friendship value increases by 1 every time they are chosen.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions can be derived using the linearity of expectation.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: The modulus value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`: The modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

2. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. It sums up the initial friendship values in `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Value:**
   - The program uses a loop to calculate the sum `s` of the expected friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The formula used in the loop is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula seems incorrect because it does not properly account for the expected increase in friendship values over time.

### Issues in the Program:
- The formula used for calculating the expected value is incorrect. The correct formula involves the sum of an arithmetic series for the expected increase in friendship values.
- The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.

### Correct Approach:
- For each pair of friends, the expected number of times they are chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
- The expected increase in friendship value for each pair over `k` excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series: \(f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f + k - 1) = k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\).
- The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs, multiplied by the probability of choosing each pair.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
