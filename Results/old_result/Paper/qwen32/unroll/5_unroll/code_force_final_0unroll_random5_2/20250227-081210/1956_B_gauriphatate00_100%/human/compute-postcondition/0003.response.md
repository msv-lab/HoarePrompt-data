Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The length of the list `a` is equal to `n`; `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `max_score` is 0.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `max_score` is initialized to 0. The other variables, `a` and `count_a`, remain unchanged as no operations have been performed on them.
