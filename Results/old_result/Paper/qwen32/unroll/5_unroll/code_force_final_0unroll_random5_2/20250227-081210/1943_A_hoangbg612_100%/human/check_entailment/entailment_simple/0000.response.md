Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided problem description and the commented execution states.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` (which starts empty) after all elements from `a` are chosen. Bob wants to minimize it. Both play optimally.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice starts by picking an element from `a`, appending it to `c`, and then removing it from `a`.
   - Bob then picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
   - This continues until `a` is empty.
3. **MEX**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy:
- **Alice's Goal**: Maximize MEX.
- **Bob's Goal**: Minimize MEX.
- **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they make choices that best serve their goals.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list `N` (which is `a` from the problem). This is a step to simplify the process of finding the MEX.
2. **Tracking Elements**: It uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number.
3. **Finding MEX**: The program iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest number not present in the array. This is done by checking if the current number is greater than `cur + 1`, where `cur` is the current MEX being checked.
4. **Adjusting MEX**: If the sum of values in `M` equals `S` (the length of the original array), it increments `cur` by 1. This step seems intended to handle cases where all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present.
5. **Handling Single Occurrences**: It then checks for numbers that appear only once and potentially adjusts `cur` based on these numbers. This part seems flawed because it doesn't correctly address the optimal strategy for both players.

### Flaws in the Program:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players. It does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and instead tries to calculate MEX based on the counts of elements, which does not account for the alternating choices of the players.
- **Handling of Single Occurrences**: The logic that adjusts `cur` based on single occurrences is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
