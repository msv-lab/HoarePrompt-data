In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range function with `t` as its argument. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's execution, we only need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, as specified in the problem statement (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). Therefore, no adjustment to `_` is necessary, and the only variable that needs to be considered is `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
