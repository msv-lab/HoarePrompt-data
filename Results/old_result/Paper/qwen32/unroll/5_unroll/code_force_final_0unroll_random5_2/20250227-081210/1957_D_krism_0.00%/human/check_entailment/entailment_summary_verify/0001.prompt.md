You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It calculates a cumulative XOR for the list and uses this to compute a final accumulated value `ans` based on the bit positions of the XOR values. The function prints the original list, the cumulative XOR list, intermediate counts of bits, and finally the accumulated value `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It calculates the prefix XOR values for the array. The prefix XOR is stored in the `prefix` list such that `prefix[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a_1` to `a_i`.

2. **Initialization of pre and suf Arrays**:
   - `pre` and `suf` are 2D arrays of size 32x2. Each sub-array `[0, 0]` is intended to count the number of prefix and suffix XOR values that have a particular bit set or not set.
   - The `pre` array is initialized with all bits unset (all zeros).

3. **Counting Bits in Suffix XORs**:
   - The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, updating the `suf` array with the count of bits set and not set in the suffix XOR values.

4. **Counting Valid Tuples**:
   - The program then iterates over the array to calculate the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the given condition.
   - For each element `y` in the array, it calculates `k` as the highest bit position set in `y` and uses this to update the count of valid tuples based on the values in `pre` and `suf`.
   - It also updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays as it moves through the array.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Tuples**:
  - The program attempts to count valid tuples by using the `pre` and `suf` arrays, but the logic for counting the number of valid tuples is flawed.
  - The condition `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)` is not directly translated into the logic used in the program. The program seems to be trying to count tuples based on the highest bit set in `y`, but this is not sufficient to correctly count all valid tuples.
  - The program does not correctly account for all possible combinations of `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the given condition. The program's logic for counting the tuples is flawed, and it does not provide the correct output for the given problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
