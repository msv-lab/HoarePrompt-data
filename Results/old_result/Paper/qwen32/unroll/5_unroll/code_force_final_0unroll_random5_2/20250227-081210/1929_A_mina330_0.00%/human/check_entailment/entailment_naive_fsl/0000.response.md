Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The idea behind maximizing the beauty is to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by arranging the elements in a zigzag pattern, where the largest and smallest elements alternate. However, the provided code sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by subtracting the smallest elements from the largest, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```
This is because the optimal arrangement could be `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, both of which yield a beauty of `(4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2` or `(1-4) + (3-1) + (2-3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2` which is not optimal. The optimal arrangement is `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]` yielding `(4-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5` or `(1-4) + (3-1) + (4-3) = -3 + 2 + 1 = 0` which is not optimal. The optimal arrangement is `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]` yielding `(4-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5` or `(4-1) + (3-2) + (3-1) = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6`.

However, the provided code will output `3` for this input, which is incorrect.

**Output from the Program:**
```
3
```

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty for all possible inputs, and hence it is incorrect.
