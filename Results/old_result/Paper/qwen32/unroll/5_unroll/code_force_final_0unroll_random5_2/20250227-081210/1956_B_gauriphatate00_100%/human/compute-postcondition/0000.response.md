Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The length of the list `a` is equal to `n`; `count_a` is an empty dictionary.**

In simple terms: The list `a` remains unchanged, and a new empty dictionary `count_a` has been created.
