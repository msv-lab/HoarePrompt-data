The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints the optimal split point for each test case, which is the number of houses that should be on the left side of the street to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side of the street want to live there.
