Reasoning:  
The program checks if it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. For Nikita to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, `n` must be at least `m` (since he cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves if he removes cubes at any point). Additionally, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change in the number of cubes. Hence, if `n - m` is even, it means that the excess moves (after reaching `m` cubes) can be balanced out by an equal number of additions and removals.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO". This matches the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
