Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. The function `func_1` only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the final balance is positive, which does not account for the penalty calculation as described.

The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_penalty(s):
    n = len(s)
    a = [1 if c == '+' else -1 for c in s]
    
    # Dynamic programming approach to find the minimum penalty
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = float('inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            current_sum += a[j - 1]
            penalty = abs(current_sum) * (i - j + 1)
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + penalty)
    
    return dp[n]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(min_penalty(expression))
```

This program uses dynamic programming to find the minimum penalty by considering all possible splits of the array and calculating the penalty for each split.
