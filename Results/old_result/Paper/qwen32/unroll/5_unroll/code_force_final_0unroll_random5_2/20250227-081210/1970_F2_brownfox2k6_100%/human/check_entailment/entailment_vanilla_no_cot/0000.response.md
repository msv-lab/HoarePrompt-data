Correctness: **False**

The provided code snippets `func_1` and `func_2` do not cover the entire logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are some reasons why the code is not complete:

1. **Handling of Player Actions**: The code does not handle the actions of players such as catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, or moving in any direction. The function `func_1` only handles the movement of an object but does not integrate with the rest of the game logic.

2. **Game State Management**: There is no code to manage the game state, such as keeping track of which player is carrying the Quaffle, the position of the Quaffle, and the positions of the goals.

3. **Scoring Mechanism**: The code does not handle the scoring mechanism. It does not check if a player has thrown the Quaffle into a goal, nor does it update the score based on the correct or incorrect placement of the Quaffle.

4. **Elimination Handling**: The function `func_2` is supposed to handle the elimination of players by the Bludger, but it does not check if a player is in the same cell as the Bludger. It simply assumes that any player in the `player` dictionary with a position matching `blud` is eliminated.

5. **Output Events**: The code does not generate the required output events such as when a team scores or when a player is eliminated.

6. **Final Score**: The code does not calculate or print the final score of the game.

To make the code correct, you would need to implement the full game logic, including handling all player actions, managing the game state, implementing the scoring mechanism, handling eliminations, and generating the correct output events.
