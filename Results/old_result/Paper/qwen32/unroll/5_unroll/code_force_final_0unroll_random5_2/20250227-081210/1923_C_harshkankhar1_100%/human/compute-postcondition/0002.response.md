Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n+1 integers where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for 1 <= i <= n is the i-th integer from the input; For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `b` is a list of n+1 integers, all initialized to 0.**
