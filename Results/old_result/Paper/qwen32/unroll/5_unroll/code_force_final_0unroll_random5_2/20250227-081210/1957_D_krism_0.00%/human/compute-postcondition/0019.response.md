Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of integers in a list `a`, and the list `a` itself which contains `n` integers. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns an output based on the provided constraints.**
