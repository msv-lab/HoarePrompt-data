### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) and performing the following changes:
- `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
- `a_i = a_i - 2`
- `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`

The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers. For each test case, it attempts to apply the operation to reduce the array elements to zero.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is not zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it repeatedly applies the operation as long as `a[i] > 1`, `a[i-1] > 0`, and `a[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation modifies the elements as described.
   - After attempting to apply the operation, it checks if `a[i-1]` is zero. If not, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - If the loop completes without finding any non-zero `a[i-1]`, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:

The main issue with the program is the incorrect implementation of the operation inside the `while` loop in `func_2`. The operation should decrement `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by `1`, `2`, and `1` respectively. However, the current implementation incorrectly multiplies these decrements by `a[i-1]`, which is not the intended behavior.

Here's the problematic line:
```python
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```
This should be:
```python
list[i + 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i - 1] -= 1
```

### Conclusion:

Given the incorrect implementation of the operation, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
