### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step using the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins. Specifically, if we bet \(x_i\) on the \(i\)-th outcome, then the total bet should satisfy:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \; i \]

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
     \]
     where GCD is the greatest common divisor.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It computes the LCM of these multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then calculates the bets \(c_i\) as \(m // k_i\) where \(m\) is the LCM.
   - If the sum of these bets is greater than or equal to \(m\), it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the bets.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the behavior of `func_1` and `func_2` as calculating the LCM.
- The annotations also correctly describe the main logic of the program.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment claims that the program does not implement the required logic because it calculates the LCM, which is not directly useful for the problem.
- However, the program's approach is actually valid. Hereâ€™s why:
  - By setting the bets \(x_i\) to \(m // k_i\) where \(m\) is the LCM, the program ensures that:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i}
    \]
  - For each \(i\), the amount received if the \(i\)-th outcome wins is:
    \[
    k_i \cdot x_i = k_i \cdot \frac{m}{k_i} = m
    \]
  - Since \(m\) is the LCM, it is the smallest number that is a multiple of all \(k_i\). Therefore, the sum of the bets \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i}\) will always be less than \(m\) because \(m\) is the least common multiple and thus:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i} < m
    \]
  - This ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem by using the LCM to derive the bets. The original assessment is incorrect because it overlooks the valid use of the LCM in this context.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
