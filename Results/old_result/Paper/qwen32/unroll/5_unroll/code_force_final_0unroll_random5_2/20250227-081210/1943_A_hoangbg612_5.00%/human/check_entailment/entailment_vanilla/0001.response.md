Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a`. Alice starts with an empty array `c`. They take turns picking an element from `a`, appending it to `c` (only for Alice), and deleting it from `a`. The game ends when `a` is empty. The goal is to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` for Alice and minimize it for Bob, assuming both play optimally.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to find the optimal MEX by sorting the array and then iterating through it to determine the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` after optimal play.

#### Key Steps in the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `T` is read.
   - For each test case, the size `S` of the array `a` and the elements of `a` are read.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted.

3. **Tracking Elements:**
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of each element in `N`.
   - A variable `cur` is used to track the current smallest non-negative integer not yet encountered in `N`.

4. **Iterating Through Sorted Array:**
   - The code iterates through the sorted array `N`. If the current number is greater than `cur`, it checks if the gap between `cur` and the current number is more than 1. If so, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it updates `cur` to the current number and records its count in `M`.

5. **Final Adjustment:**
   - After the loop, if all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `M` with counts matching their values, `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - The code then checks if any number less than `cur` has a count less than or equal to its value. If such a number is found, `cur` is updated to that number.

6. **Output:**
   - The final value of `cur` is printed as the MEX.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Inadequate Handling of Bob's Moves:**
  - The code does not explicitly account for Bob's moves, which are crucial for determining the final MEX. Bob's strategy of minimizing the MEX affects the outcome, and the current code does not simulate this.
  
- **Incorrect Logic for Determining MEX:**
  - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The code does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns and the final MEX is determined based on the optimal play of both players.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly simulate the game and determine the optimal MEX for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
