### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the first value as the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Finding the Year of the N-th Sign**:
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining periodicities `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each periodicity `a[i]`, it calculates the next year `next_year` when the i-th sign will occur after the previous sign occurred in `last_year`. The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues for the next sign.
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to `sys.stdout`, each on a new line.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify with the first example test case:
- **Input**: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing**:
  - `last_year` starts at `3`.
  - For `a[1] = 2`, `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`.
  - For `a[2] = 4`, `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`.
  - For `a[3] = 5`, `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`.
  - For `a[4] = 9`, `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`.
  - For `a[5] = 18`, `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`.
- **Output**: `36`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
