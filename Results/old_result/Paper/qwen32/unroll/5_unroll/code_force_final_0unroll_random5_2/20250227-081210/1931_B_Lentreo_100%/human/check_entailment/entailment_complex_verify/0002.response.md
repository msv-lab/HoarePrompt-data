### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed and accurate analysis of the problem and the program. Let's break down the key points and verify them:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to distribute water equally among `n` containers using a specific pouring operation (pouring from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`).
   - The total water is divisible by `n`, so each container should ideally have `mean = total / n` units of water.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The operation constraint (pouring from left to right) implies that we cannot "borrow" water from a container on the right to a container on the left. Therefore, if at any point the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target `mean` becomes negative, it's impossible to achieve the equal distribution.

3. **Solution Strategy**:
   - Calculate the target water level `mean`.
   - Traverse the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total (`curr`) of the difference between the current water level and `mean`.
   - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, return "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, return "YES".

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly calculates the target water level `mean`.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0 and iterates through the list of water amounts, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current water amount and `mean`.
   - If `curr` becomes negative, it correctly returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it correctly returns "YES".

5. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - They confirm that the program checks the necessary conditions to determine if equal distribution is possible under the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the given operation constraints. The annotations and the original assessment both support this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
