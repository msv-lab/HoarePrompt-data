The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it determines if the string `c` matches a specific pattern derived from `a` and `b`. The pattern requires that for each position, if `a` and `b` have the same character, `c` must also have the same character; if `a` and `b` differ, `c` must not have the same character as either `a` or `b` at that position. The function outputs 'YES' if `c` matches the pattern and 'NO' otherwise.
