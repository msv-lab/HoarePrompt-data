To determine the output state, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables involved.

1. **Initial State:**
    - `array` is a list of integers.
    - `data` is a list of strings representing integers.
    - `t` is the number of iterations, derived from `int(data[0])`.
    - `index` is set to 1.
    - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
    - The loop runs `t` times.
    - In each iteration:
        - `n` is set to `int(data[index])`.
        - `index` is incremented by 1.
        - `array` is updated to the next `n` integers from `data`, starting from `data[index]`.
        - `index` is incremented by `n`.
        - `result` is computed by calling `func_1(array)`.
        - `result` is appended to `results`.

3. **Final State:**
    - After the loop completes, `index` will have been incremented by 1 for each `t` and then by `n` for each iteration, where `n` is the number of elements in the current `array`.
    - `results` will contain the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration.
    - `array` will be left with the last set of integers it was assigned from `data`.
    - `t` and `data` remain unchanged from their initial values.

Given the above, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`array` is the last list of integers processed in the loop, `data` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `index` is incremented by 1 for each iteration plus the length of each processed array, and `results` contains the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration.**
