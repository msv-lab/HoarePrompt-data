Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The task is to construct a permutation `p` from the given array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The program provided attempts to construct `p` by iterating from the end of `a` to the beginning and calculating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, updating `mex` accordingly.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

### Analysis

1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a reasonable starting point since the MEX of an empty array is `0` and it can only increase as elements are added.
2. **Iteration**: The program iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.
3. **Output**: The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

### Potential Issues

1. **Correctness of MEX Calculation**: The program updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This is incorrect because `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p` up to that point. The current logic might incorrectly update `mex` to a value that is already present in `p`, which would violate the MEX property.
2. **Handling of Negative Values**: The problem specifies that `a_i` can be negative, but the program does not handle this correctly. If `a[i]` is negative, `p[i]` could be greater than `mex`, which would not satisfy the MEX property.
3. **Ensuring Uniqueness**: The program does not ensure that the constructed `p` is a permutation, i.e., all elements from `0` to `n-1` must be present exactly once.

### Example to Show Incorrectness

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
-1 0 1
```

The program will construct `p` as follows:
- For `i = 2`, `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 3 - 1 = 2` and `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 1`, `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 0 = 2` and `mex = min(2, 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 0`, `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 2 - (-1) = 3` and `mex = min(2, 3) = 2`.

The constructed `p` is `[3, 2, 2]`, which is not a valid permutation because it contains duplicate values and a value outside the range `[0, 2]`.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and does not ensure that the constructed `p` is a valid permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
