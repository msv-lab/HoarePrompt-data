Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the game's score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the MEX of the array `c` after the game, but it does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
   - The program sorts the array `N` and then attempts to find the MEX based on the sorted array, which does not reflect the game's rules.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Turns**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Alice should try to maximize the MEX, and Bob should try to minimize it.
   - The current implementation does not alternate turns between Alice and Bob, and it does not account for the optimal moves each player would make.

3. **Incorrect Logic for MEX**:
   - The logic for finding the MEX is flawed. The program checks for the smallest missing number in a way that does not consider the game dynamics.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where multiple elements are the same or when the array contains gaps.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, keeping track of the elements in `c`, and then calculating the MEX of `c` after the game ends. The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob should be considered, which involves Alice trying to include as many small numbers as possible while Bob tries to prevent this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        count = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            if num < S:
                count[num] += 1

        mex = 0
        for i in range(S):
            if count[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            if count[i] > 1:
                mex = i + 1

        print(mex)

func()
```

This corrected version counts the occurrences of each number in the array `N` and then determines the MEX based on the counts, considering the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
