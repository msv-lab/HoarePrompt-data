The code snippet `data = input().split()` takes the raw input data, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The initial state includes the input data `input` which is a string consisting of integers separated by spaces. After executing the code, the `input` variable remains unchanged, but `data` becomes a list of these integers as strings.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs; `input` is assigned the raw input data; `data` is a list of strings representing the split input data.**
