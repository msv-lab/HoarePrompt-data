Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. The current logic checks only the first and last rows and the first and last columns for uniformity and equality, which is insufficient to determine the possibility of making the entire grid uniform.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
BWB
WBB
BWB
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In this grid, there is no way to make all squares the same color using the allowed operations. The program, however, would incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks the first and last rows and columns, which are not uniform and do not contradict the possibility of making the grid uniform.

The program needs to check if there is at least one "B" and one "W" in the grid. If both "B" and "W" are present, it is impossible to make all squares the same color, and the program should output "NO". If the grid contains only "B" or only "W", the output should be "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        has_black = False
        has_white = False
        for i in range(n):
            row = input()
            a.append(row)
            if 'B' in row:
                has_black = True
            if 'W' in row:
                has_white = True
            if has_black and has_white:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected program checks each row for the presence of both "B" and "W". If both are found in any row, it immediately outputs "NO". If the loop completes without finding both, it outputs "YES".
