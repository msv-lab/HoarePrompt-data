Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to construct an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences, but it does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when X is a large number or when it does not fit the pattern of the binary representation approach used in the code.

The approach in the code seems to be based on the idea of representing X in binary and then using the binary digits to determine the structure of the array. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences for all values of X.

For example, consider the input `X = 3`. According to the problem description, the array should have exactly 3 increasing subsequences. The code would output something like:
```
1
-100000000
```
which is incorrect because this array has only 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the single-element subsequence are not counted as distinct for this problem).

Another example is `X = 6`. The code would output something like:
```
2
-100000000 99999999
```
which is incorrect because this array has only 3 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence, the subsequence consisting of the first element, and the subsequence consisting of both elements).

The core issue is that the code does not correctly map the binary representation of X to an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. There is no clear mechanism in the code to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches X for all possible values of X.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
