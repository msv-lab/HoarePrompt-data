To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and its effect on the variables. The loop iterates `test_cases` number of times, and during each iteration, it calls `func_6()`. However, the problem does not specify what `func_6()` does or what variables it might modify. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can only conclude that `func_6()` is called `test_cases` times, and no other variables in the initial state are affected.

Given that the problem asks us to describe the output state in a format similar to the initial state and only change the values of variables in the loop head and body, we can infer that `test_cases` remains unchanged, and no new variables are introduced.

Output State: **`test_cases` holds the value returned by `func_1()`.**
