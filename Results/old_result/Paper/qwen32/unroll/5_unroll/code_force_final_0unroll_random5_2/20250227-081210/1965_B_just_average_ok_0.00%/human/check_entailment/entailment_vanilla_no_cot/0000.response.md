To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic in the context of the problem requirements.

The program is supposed to generate a sequence of non-negative integers such that:
1. No subsequence of the sequence sums up to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums up to `v`.

The program generates a sequence using powers of 2 up to `2^23` (since `1 << i` generates `2^i`). It then adjusts the sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while ensuring that all other sums up to `1` to `n` (except `k`) are possible.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Generating Powers of 2**:
   - `nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]` generates a list of the first 24 powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`.

2. **Adjusting for `k`**:
   - It finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` using a while loop.
   - It then appends three new elements to the list:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - `k + 1`: This is a simple increment of `k` to ensure it's covered if needed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is another increment to ensure it's covered if needed.
   - It removes the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` to prevent `k` from being formed.

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the length of the adjusted sequence and the sequence itself.

### Analysis:
- The sequence generated by the program is based on powers of 2, which are known to form all sums up to `2^24 - 1` without repetition.
- By adjusting the sequence to exclude `k`, the program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
- However, the addition of `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` and the removal of `nums[idx]` might not always guarantee that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) are possible, especially for large `n` and `k`.

### Issues:
- The program does not guarantee that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) are possible. It only adjusts for `k` but does not ensure the completeness of other sums.
- The removal of a power of 2 and the addition of new elements might disrupt the ability to form certain sums.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly ensure that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) are possible while also ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
