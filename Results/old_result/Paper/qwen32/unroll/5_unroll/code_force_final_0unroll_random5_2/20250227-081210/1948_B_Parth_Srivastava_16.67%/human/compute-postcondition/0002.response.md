The code snippet converts the string `a` into a list of integers by splitting the string and mapping each split component to an integer.

Given that `a` is initially a string, after the operation `a = list(map(int, a.split()))`, `a` will be a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of integers; `k` is an input integer.**
