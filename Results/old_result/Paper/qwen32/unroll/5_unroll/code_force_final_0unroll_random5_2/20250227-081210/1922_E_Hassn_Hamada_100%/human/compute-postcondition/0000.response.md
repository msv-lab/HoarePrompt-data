The provided code snippet does not actually modify the `number` or `sequence` variables. The code defines a docstring for a function that is supposed to generate a sequence based on the input number, but the function itself is not implemented or called in the snippet. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of positive integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.**
