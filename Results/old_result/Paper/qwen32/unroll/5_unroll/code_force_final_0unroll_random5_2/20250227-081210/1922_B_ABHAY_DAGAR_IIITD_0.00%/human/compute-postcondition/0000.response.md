The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected or modified by this code. The initial state specifies that `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. Since the code only initializes `results` and does not interact with `test_cases`, the state of `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**
