Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads three digits and checks the required conditions:

1. If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
2. If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
3. Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The conditions are correctly checked and the corresponding strings are printed as per the problem description. The program handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
