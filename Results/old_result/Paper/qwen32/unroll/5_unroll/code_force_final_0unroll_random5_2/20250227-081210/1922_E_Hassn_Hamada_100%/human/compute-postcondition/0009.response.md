To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the loop and how it modifies the `sequence` list.

Given:
- Initial State: `size` is the first element of `size_overlap`, `overlap` is the second element of `size_overlap` (which is `i`).

Let's assume `size_overlap` is `[size, overlap]`. 

The loop is:
```python
for i in range(size - overlap):
    sequence.append(i + overlap)
```

This loop iterates `size - overlap` times. In each iteration, it appends `i + overlap` to the `sequence` list.

Let's denote the initial length of `sequence` as `len(sequence) = n`.

After the loop, the `sequence` list will contain `n + (size - overlap)` elements. Specifically, the new elements added to `sequence` will be:
\[ \text{overlap}, \text{overlap}+1, \text{overlap}+2, \ldots, \text{size} - 1 \]

Thus, the `sequence` list will be extended by the numbers from `overlap` to `size - 1`.

Output State: **`sequence` is extended by numbers from `overlap` to `size - 1`.**
