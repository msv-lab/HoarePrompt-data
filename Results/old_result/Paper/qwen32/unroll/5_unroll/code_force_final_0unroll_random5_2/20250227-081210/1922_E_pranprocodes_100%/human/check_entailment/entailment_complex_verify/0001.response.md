### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem of generating an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to construct an array such that the number of its increasing subsequences equals a given number \( X \). The number of increasing subsequences can be influenced by the structure of the array, including the number of distinct elements and their order.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to generate the array based on the binary representation of \( X \). Here is a detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max` and `min` are initialized to large positive and negative values.
   - `ans` is an empty list to store the array.
   - `t` is a counter for the length of the array.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues until \( X \) becomes 1.
   - If \( X \) is even, it appends `max` to the array, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
   - If \( X \) is odd, it appends `min` to the array, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - This process effectively converts \( X \) into a binary representation, where each bit corresponds to an element in the array.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - The array `ans` is reversed to match the correct order of the binary representation.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the array `t` is printed.
   - The elements of the array `ans` are printed.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The program's approach of using binary representation to generate the array is fundamentally flawed. The binary representation of \( X \) does not inherently map to the number of increasing subsequences in a way that guarantees the correct count.
- For example, if \( X = 5 \), the binary representation is `101`. The program would generate an array like `[min, max, min]` (or similar), but this does not necessarily result in exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
- The number of increasing subsequences in an array depends on the specific arrangement and values of the elements, and the binary representation does not capture this complexity.

#### Specific Example:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- For \( X = 5 \), the binary representation is `101`. The program might generate an array like `[min, max, min]`. However, the number of increasing subsequences in such an array is not guaranteed to be 5. In fact, it is likely to be different.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It attempts to use a binary representation to generate the array, but this approach does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences. A more sophisticated approach is required to construct the array such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
