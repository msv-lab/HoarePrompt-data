You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged; `ntest` remains unchanged; `n` is the number of elements in the last test case's list; `a` is the sorted list of integers from the last test case; `kq` is the computed value from the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires maximizing the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty is calculated as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this, we need to consider how to order the elements of the array. The optimal strategy is to arrange the elements in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements. One effective method is to interleave the largest and smallest elements alternately.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array in ascending order.
2. **Interleave Largest and Smallest**: To maximize the differences, interleave the largest and smallest elements. This can be achieved by pairing the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
3. **Calculate the Beauty**: Compute the beauty by summing up the differences between these pairs.

### Provided Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)
```

#### Steps in the Program

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the array in ascending order.
3. **Calculating Beauty**: It attempts to calculate the beauty by iterating through half of the sorted array and summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements.

#### Issues in the Program

- **Interleaving Logic**: The provided program does not correctly implement the interleaving strategy. It simply sums the differences between the largest and smallest elements without considering the correct order to maximize the beauty.
- **Handling Even and Odd Lengths**: The program assumes that the array length is always even and does not handle the case where the length is odd correctly.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would involve interleaving the elements correctly and handling both even and odd lengths properly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            kq += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])
        print(kq)
```

However, the original program's logic for calculating the beauty is flawed, and thus it is incorrect.
