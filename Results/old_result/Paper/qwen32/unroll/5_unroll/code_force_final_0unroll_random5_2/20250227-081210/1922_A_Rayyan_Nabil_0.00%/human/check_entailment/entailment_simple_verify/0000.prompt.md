You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: l is 'YES' or 'NO' based on the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine if there exists a template such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The issue lies in the logic used within the loop and the handling of the `l` variable.

The current logic is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
        l = 'YES'
else:
    l = 'NO'
print(l)
```
This logic sets `l` to 'YES' if, for any position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, it does not ensure that for every position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the template while `c[i]` does not.

A correct approach should ensure that for every position `i`:
1. If the template character is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match it, and `c[i]` must not.
2. If the template character is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must not match the lowercase version of it, and `c[i]` must match it.

The current code does not correctly handle these conditions. Instead, it only checks if there exists at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  ab
  ac
  bc
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output of the Program:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this example, there is no template that can make both `a` and `b` match while `c` does not match. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES".

A correct solution would involve iterating through each position and constructing a template that satisfies the conditions for all positions.
