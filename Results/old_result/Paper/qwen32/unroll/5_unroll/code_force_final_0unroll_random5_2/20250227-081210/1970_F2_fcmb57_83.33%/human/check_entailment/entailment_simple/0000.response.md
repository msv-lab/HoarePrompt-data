### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to understand its correctness based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (N, M) and initializes necessary variables and data structures.
   - It then reads the field configuration, identifying positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program processes each move in the sequence. For each move:
     - **Movement (U, D, L, R):** The player moves in the specified direction. The function `func_1` is used to calculate the new position correctly.
     - **Catch (C):** The player catches the specified ball (Quaffle or Bludger). However, there is a typo in the code: `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.
     - **Throw (T):** The player throws the Quaffle. The program then checks if the Quaffle is in a goal cell and updates the score accordingly. If the Quaffle is in a goal cell of the opposite team, the correct team is awarded the point. If the Quaffle is in a goal cell of the same team, the opposite team is awarded the point.

3. **Elimination Handling:**
   - The program correctly identifies and handles player elimination when a player and the Bludger occupy the same cell. It prints the elimination event and updates the Quaffle's position if the eliminated player was carrying it.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the final score after processing all moves.

### Issues Identified:
- **Typo in Catch Action:** The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player to the Quaffle.
- **Incorrect Quaffle Reset:** The Quaffle should always reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, regardless of which team's player scored. The current code incorrectly resets the Quaffle to the player's position if the player scored in their own goal.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issues, the program is not entirely correct. Specifically, the typo in the catch action and the incorrect Quaffle reset logic need to be fixed.

**Correctness: **False**
