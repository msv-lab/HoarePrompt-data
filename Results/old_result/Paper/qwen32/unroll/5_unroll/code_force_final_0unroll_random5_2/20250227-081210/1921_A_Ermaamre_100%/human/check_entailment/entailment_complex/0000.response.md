### Reasoning:
The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, we can determine the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, as the square is symmetrical in this regard).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then for each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of one of the corners of the square.
2. **Coordinate Extraction**: It extracts the x-coordinates from the list of points.
3. **Side Length Calculation**: It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`).
4. **Area Calculation**: It calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length (`dx * dx`).
5. **Output**: It prints the calculated area for each test case.

The program assumes that the given points indeed form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, which is guaranteed by the problem statement.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:
- **First Test Case**:
  - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - x-coordinates: 1, 4, 1, 4
  - Side length: `max(x) - min(x) = 4 - 1 = 3`
  - Area: `3 * 3 = 9`
- **Second Test Case**:
  - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - x-coordinates: -1, 1, 1, -1
  - Side length: `max(x) - min(x) = 1 - (-1) = 2`
  - Area: `2 * 2 = 4`
- **Third Test Case**:
  - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - x-coordinates: 45, 45, 17, 17
  - Side length: `max(x) - min(x) = 45 - 17 = 28`
  - Area: `28 * 28 = 784`

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the area of a square given its corner coordinates, and it handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
