The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` pairs of distinct nodes with associated values. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on these inputs, using modular arithmetic with a modulus of \(10^9 + 7\). The final output for each test case is determined by a formula involving the sum of the associated values and a series calculation.
