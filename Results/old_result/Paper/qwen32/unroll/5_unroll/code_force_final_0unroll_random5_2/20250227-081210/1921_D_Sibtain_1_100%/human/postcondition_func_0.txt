The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum possible sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of the two lists when elements are optimally paired. If all elements in both lists are the same, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it sorts one list in ascending order and the other in descending order, then computes the sum based on the specified pairing strategy.
