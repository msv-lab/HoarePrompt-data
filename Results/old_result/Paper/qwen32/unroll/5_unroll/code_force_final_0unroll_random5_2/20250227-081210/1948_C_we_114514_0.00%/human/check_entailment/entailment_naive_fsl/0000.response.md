Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Let's analyze the logic of the program and find a counterexample.

The program uses two flags, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track whether the robot can reach the end of the first row and the second row, respectively. However, the logic does not account for the possibility of moving up or down at each step, which is a critical part of the problem description.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Example:**
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (2, 1) and follow the arrow to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), it can move to (1, 2) and follow the arrow to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it can move to (2, 3) and follow the arrow to (2, 4).

Thus, the robot can reach (2, 4) in this case.

**Program Output:**
```
NO
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the up and down movements. It only checks if the robot can move right in the same row or switch rows based on the arrow direction, but it does not account for the possibility of moving up or down at each step.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
