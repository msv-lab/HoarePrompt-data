Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It iterates through the array and returns `False` if any element is not zero. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented to check if all elements are zero.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero by applying the described operation.
   - The loop iterates through the array from the second element to the second last element (i.e., `for i in range(1, n - 1)`).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1 and if the adjacent elements `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation: 
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - However, there is a logical flaw in the operation logic. The operation should decrement `list[i+1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively, not by multiples of `list[i-1]`.
   - After the loop, it checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`. If they are, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Flaw in the Operation Logic**:
   - The operation logic in `func_2` is incorrect. It should decrement the elements by fixed values (1, 2, 1) rather than by multiples of `list[i-1]`. This means the current implementation does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the operation simulation within `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
