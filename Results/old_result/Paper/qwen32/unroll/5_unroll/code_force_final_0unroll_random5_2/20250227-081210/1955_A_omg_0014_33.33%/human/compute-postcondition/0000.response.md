The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The value of `n` is overwritten by the user input, but the constraints on `t`, `a`, and `b` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 30; `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 30.**
