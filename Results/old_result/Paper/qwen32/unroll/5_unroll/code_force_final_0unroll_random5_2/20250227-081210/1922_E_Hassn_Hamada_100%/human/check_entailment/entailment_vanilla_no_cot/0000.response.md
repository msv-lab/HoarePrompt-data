Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is intended to generate a sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences required, but the logic implemented is flawed and does not guarantee the correct number of subsequences.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The function `func_1` is supposed to append elements to the `sequence` list to form an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences, but the way it calculates and appends elements does not ensure the correct count of subsequences.
2. The base case and recursive logic within `func_1` do not align with the problem's requirements for generating the correct sequence.
3. The program does not handle the edge cases and constraints properly, such as generating a sequence with the minimum possible length and ensuring all elements are within the specified range.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to understand the relationship between the number of elements in the array and the number of increasing subsequences it can generate. For example, an array with `n` elements where each element is unique will have `2^n` increasing subsequences (including the empty subsequence). However, the problem requires generating a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences, which may not be a power of 2 and requires careful construction.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the problem requirements:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

stdin = sys.stdin
stdout = sys.stdout
test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(test_cases):
    X = int(input())
    if X == 1:
        print(0)
        print()
        continue
    n = 0
    while (1 << n) <= X:
        n += 1
    if (1 << n) != X + 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        result = []
        for i in range(n):
            result.append(i)
        print(n)
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This program checks if `X` is of the form `2^n - 1` (which is the maximum number of increasing subsequences for an array of length `n` with unique elements). If `X` is not of this form, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it constructs an array of length `n` with elements `0, 1, 2, ..., n-1`. This array will have exactly `2^n - 1` increasing subsequences (excluding the empty subsequence).
