To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the code step-by-step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5000).
   - `num` is a string containing the input line.
   - `out` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `int(num)` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `list2` and `list1` are initialized as empty lists.
     - `a` is read as an integer from the input.
     - `b` is read as a string from the input.
     - `list1` is populated with the elements of `b` split by spaces and then sorted.
     - A loop runs `a` times, appending every second element (starting from index 0) of `list1` to `list2`.
     - The sum of `list2` is appended to `out`.
     - `list1` and `list2` are cleared.

3. **Final State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `num` remains unchanged.
   - `out` will contain the sums of the selected elements from each iteration.

Given this understanding, the output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `num` is a string containing the input line; `out` is a list containing the sums of the selected elements from each iteration.**
