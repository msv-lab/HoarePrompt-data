You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0), and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the differences between the chosen vertices and the total number of vertices `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The program only counts the number of adjacent vertices that are exactly one position apart (i.e., `num == 1`). This is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.
   - The program does not account for the possibility of forming triangles with vertices that are not adjacent but can form non-intersecting diagonals.

2. **Handling the Circular Nature of the Polygon:**
   - The program correctly handles the circular nature of the polygon by considering the distance between the first and last vertices. However, it only checks if the distance is exactly one, which is not enough to maximize the number of triangles.

3. **Maximizing Triangular Pieces:**
   - To maximize the number of triangular pieces, we need to consider all possible sets of three vertices that can form a triangle without intersecting with other diagonals. This involves more complex logic than just checking adjacent vertices.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:

1. **Sort the Chosen Vertices:**
   - Sort the vertices Bessie has chosen to make it easier to calculate the distances between them.

2. **Calculate the Maximum Number of Triangles:**
   - Use a more sophisticated algorithm to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles. This typically involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach to select the optimal set of vertices to form triangles.

### Example of Incorrect Output:

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Program Output:**
```
2
```

While the program gives the correct output for this test case, it does not handle more complex scenarios correctly. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
8 4 0
1 3 5 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Program Output:**
```
2
```

In this case, the program only counts the adjacent vertices that are one position apart, which results in an incorrect count of triangles. The correct approach should account for all possible non-intersecting triangles that can be formed.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for all potential cases. It only considers a limited subset of possible triangles and does not account for more complex configurations.
