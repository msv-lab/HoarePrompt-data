Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly perform the decoding operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program is reversing the mapping process instead of correctly reversing the encoding process.

Here's the issue in detail:

The program constructs a mapping from each character in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters `r`. However, this mapping is incorrect for decoding because it maps each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`, instead of mapping each character in `b` back to its original character in `s`.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`:
- The unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically form `r = "cdefors"`.
- The program maps each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`:
  - 's' -> 'c'
  - 'e' -> 'r'
  - 'r' -> 'd'
  - 'o' -> 'f'
  - 'f' -> 'o'
  - 'e' -> 'r'
  - 'd' -> 'c'
  - 's' -> 'c'
  - 'o' -> 'f'
  - 'c' -> 's'
- This results in the decoded string `"codeforces"`, which is correct in this specific case, but this is coincidental and not due to the correct logic.

However, let's consider another example to illustrate the issue:
- Suppose the encoded string `b = "tft"`.
- The unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically form `r = "ft"`.
- The program maps each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`:
  - 't' -> 'f'
  - 'f' -> 't'
  - 't' -> 'f'
- This results in the decoded string `"ftf"`, which is incorrect. The correct decoded string should be `"ttt"`.

Thus, the program does not correctly decode the string in all cases and hence is incorrect.

To correct the program, we need to map each character in `b` back to its original character in `s` by reversing the encoding process correctly. This would involve mapping each character in `r` to its symmetric character and then using this mapping to decode `b`.
