Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. The program attempts to generate an array based on the binary representation of X, but it does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences of the generated array is exactly X. The approach used does not follow a method that guarantees the correct number of increasing subsequences for arbitrary X.

To solve this problem correctly, one needs to understand that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be controlled by the structure of the array. For example, an array with elements in strictly increasing order has exactly 2^n increasing subsequences (including the empty subsequence), where n is the length of the array. However, to achieve exactly X increasing subsequences, a more sophisticated approach is needed, especially since X can be as large as 10^18.

A correct approach would involve constructing an array with a specific pattern that results in exactly X increasing subsequences, which is not what the provided program does.
