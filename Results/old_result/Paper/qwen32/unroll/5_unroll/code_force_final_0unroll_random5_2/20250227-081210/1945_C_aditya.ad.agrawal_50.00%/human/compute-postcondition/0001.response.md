The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For the `while t:` loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is given that `t` is between 1 and 2Â·10^4, `t` should indeed be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed in this case since the problem statement already ensures that `t` is a positive integer. However, if we strictly follow the instruction to adjust the state for the loop to execute, we can state that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and `t` must be greater than 0**. 

However, given the problem constraints, it is already ensured that `t` is at least 1, so the state can also be simply:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases**.
