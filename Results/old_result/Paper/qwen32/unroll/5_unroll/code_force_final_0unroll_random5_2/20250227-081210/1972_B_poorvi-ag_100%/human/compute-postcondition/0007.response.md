Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". It then determines if the count of "U" in `s` is odd and appends 'yes' to the results if true, otherwise 'no'. Finally, it prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the count of "U".**
