The code snippet provided assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the return values of `func_1()`. The other variables (`arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`) remain unchanged. Since the specific return values of `func_1()` are not provided, we can only state that `n` and `k` will take on whatever values `func_1()` returns.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation, `pos` is an integer representing the index of the element `k` in `arr`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range within the array, and `st` is a set used to store midpoints during the binary search process.**
