Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made entirely zero using the specified operations. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Logic**: The program incorrectly attempts to manipulate the array elements without properly checking if the operation can be performed. Specifically, it decreases `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` based on the value of `b[i]` but does not ensure that these elements are non-negative after the operation.

2. **Incorrect Loop and Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `a-2`, which is correct in terms of iterating through the valid indices where the operation can be applied, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. The program should check if the operation can be performed before applying it (i.e., `b[i] <= b[i+1] / 2` and `b[i] <= b[i+2]`), and it should also ensure that after the operation, `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` do not become negative.

3. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements are zero, but this is not sufficient. The program should ensure that all elements are zero, not just the last two.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(n - 2):
            if a[i] > a[i + 1] // 2 or a[i] > a[i + 2]:
                print('NO')
                break
            a[i + 1] -= a[i] * 2
            a[i + 2] -= a[i]
            a[i] -= a[i]
        else:
            if all(x == 0 for x in a):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program ensures that the operation can be performed safely and checks if all elements are zero after attempting to make them zero.
