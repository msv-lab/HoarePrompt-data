Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in an array `a`, followed by `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` representing the elements of the array `a`. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
