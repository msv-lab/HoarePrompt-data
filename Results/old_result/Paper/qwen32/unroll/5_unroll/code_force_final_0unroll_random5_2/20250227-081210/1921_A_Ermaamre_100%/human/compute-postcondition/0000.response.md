Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, with each line containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged as the code snippet only reads the number of test cases and does not affect any other variables or conditions.
