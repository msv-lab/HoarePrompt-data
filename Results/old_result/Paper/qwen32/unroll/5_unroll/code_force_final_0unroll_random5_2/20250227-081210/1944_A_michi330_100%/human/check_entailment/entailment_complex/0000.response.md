### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. Initially, all islands are connected in a fully connected graph, meaning there are \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) bridges.

The key insight is that if Dominater destroys `k` bridges, the number of islands Everule can visit depends on whether `k` is sufficient to isolate island 1 from all other islands. Specifically:
- If `k` is at least `n-1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, leaving Everule only able to visit island 1.
- If `k` is less than `n-1`, Dominater cannot fully isolate island 1, and Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

The provided code correctly implements this logic:
- It reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of islands) and `k` (the number of bridges Dominater can destroy).
- It then checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`.
  - If true, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
  - If false, it prints `n` (Everule can visit all islands).

### Correctness:
The code correctly handles the logic described above for each test case. Therefore, the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
