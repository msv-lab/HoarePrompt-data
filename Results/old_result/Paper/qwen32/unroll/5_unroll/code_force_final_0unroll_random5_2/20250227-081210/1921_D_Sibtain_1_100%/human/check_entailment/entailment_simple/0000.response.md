### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is a permutation of \( n \) elements chosen from \( m \) elements in \( b_i \).

The provided program aims to achieve this by:
1. Sorting the array \( a \) in ascending order.
2. Sorting the array \( b \) (renamed as \( c \) in the code) in descending order.
3. Pairing the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( c \) to maximize the absolute differences.

The logic behind the sorting and pairing strategy is sound:
- By sorting \( a \) in ascending order, we ensure that the smallest elements are matched with the largest possible elements from \( c \) to maximize their differences.
- By sorting \( c \) in descending order, we ensure that the largest elements are matched with the smallest possible elements from \( a \) to maximize their differences.

The code also handles edge cases:
- If all elements in \( a \) and \( c \) are the same, it immediately returns 0 since no difference can be achieved.
- If \( n = 1 \), it calculates the maximum difference by comparing the single element of \( a \) with the maximum and minimum elements of \( c \).

The loop iterates through each element of \( a \) and calculates the maximum possible difference for each pair, ensuring that the total difference is maximized.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \) as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the desired result within the given constraints.
