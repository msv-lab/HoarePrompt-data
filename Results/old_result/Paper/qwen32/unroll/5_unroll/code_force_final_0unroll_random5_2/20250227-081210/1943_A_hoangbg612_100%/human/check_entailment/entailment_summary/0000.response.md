### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly determine the MEX in all cases.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. **Sorting and Counting Logic**: The program sorts the array and then iterates through it to determine the MEX. However, the logic for counting and determining the MEX is incorrect. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple occurrences of the same number and does not ensure that the smallest missing non-negative integer is found.
2. **Handling of Unique Elements**: The program checks if there are at least two unique elements with a count of 1, but this does not correctly determine the MEX. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c`, and this check does not account for all possible scenarios.
3. **Final Adjustment**: The program adjusts the `cur` variable at the end based on the sum of the counts, but this logic is not correct for determining the MEX.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly compute the MEX for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
