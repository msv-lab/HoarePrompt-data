### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The program reads multiple test cases, each with a different set of periodicities for the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` from the first element of this list.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of their periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining signs. For each sign `i` (from 1 to n-1):
     - It calculates the next year when the i-th sign will occur after the last sign (`last_year`). This is done using the formula:
       \[
       \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
       \]
       This formula finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
     - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.
   - After processing all signs in a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

### Analysis:

The formula used to calculate `next_year` ensures that the program correctly finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`, which is exactly what is needed to determine when the next sign will occur after the previous one.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently, storing the results for each test case and outputting them at the end.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic matches the problem's requirements, and it correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
