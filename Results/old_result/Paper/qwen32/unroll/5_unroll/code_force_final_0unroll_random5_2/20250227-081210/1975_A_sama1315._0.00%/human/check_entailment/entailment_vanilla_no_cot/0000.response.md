Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or not, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping its parts.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists an index where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part is less than or equal to the first part when swapped. This requires a more sophisticated check than just verifying if the array is sorted or not.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_be_sorted_by_splitting(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the point where the array stops being sorted
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            break
    else:
        # The array is already sorted
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Check if the array can be split at this point and sorted
    # The part after i should be less than or equal to the part before i
    for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
        if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
            return 'No'
    
    # Check if the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part
    if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
        return 'No'
    
    # Check if the smallest element of the second part is less than or equal to the largest element of the first part
    if arr[0] > arr[i + 1]:
        return 'No'
    
    return 'Yes'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = can_be_sorted_by_splitting(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

This corrected function `can_be_sorted_by_splitting` properly checks the conditions required to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping its parts.
