You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

                greater_count += 1
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, an integer `f` indicating the position of a favorite element in the list, and an integer `k`. It also receives a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then determines whether there are at least `k` elements in the list that are greater than the favorite element, or if the total of elements greater than or equal to the favorite element is less than or equal to `k`. Based on these conditions, it prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube's value appears multiple times and the number of cubes removed (k) is such that it could potentially remove the favorite cube in some cases but not in others.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 4
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Explanation:**
- Here, `n=5`, `f=2`, `k=4`, and the values on the cubes are `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
- The favorite cube's value is `3`, and it appears 5 times.
- After sorting, the list remains `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
- Since `k=4`, the first 4 cubes are removed. The favorite cube at index `f=2` (originally at index `1` in 0-based indexing) is still present in the list after removing the first 4 cubes.

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```
**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```
The program incorrectly outputs `YES` because it does not account for the scenario where the favorite cube's value is the same as other cubes and the number of cubes removed could leave the favorite cube in the list. The logic should correctly handle such edge cases to determine if the favorite cube could be removed or not in all possible scenarios.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
