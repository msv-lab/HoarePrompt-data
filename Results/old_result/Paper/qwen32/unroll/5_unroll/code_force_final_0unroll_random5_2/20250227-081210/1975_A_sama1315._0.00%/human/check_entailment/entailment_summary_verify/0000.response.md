### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks for any pair of adjacent elements that are out of order. If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the operation multiple times. For example, an array like `[2, 3, 1, 4]` can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts multiple times, but `func_1` would return 'No' for such an array.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - Since `func_1` is flawed, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results for cases where the array can be sorted by performing the operation multiple times.

3. **Example Test Case:**
   - The provided example test case `[2, 3, 1, 4]` demonstrates the issue. The correct output should be 'Yes' because the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts, but `func_1` returns 'No'.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program is incorrect due to the limitations of `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
