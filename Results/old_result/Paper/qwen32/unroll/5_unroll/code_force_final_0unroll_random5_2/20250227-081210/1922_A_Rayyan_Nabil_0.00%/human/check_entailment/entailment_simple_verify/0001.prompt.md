You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and then the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then iterates through each character of the strings using a for loop.
4. Inside the loop, it checks whether the i-th character of `a` and `b` is different from the i-th character of `c`. If this condition is true for any character position `i`, it sets `l` to 'YES'.
5. However, the `else` clause of the for loop (which executes if the loop completes without a `break`) sets `l` to 'NO'. This means that if there is even one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both equal to `c[i]`, the program will output 'NO' for that test case.
6. Finally, the program prints the value of `l` for each test case.

The logic in the program is flawed because it does not correctly determine if there exists a template `t` that satisfies the conditions for all characters in the string. Specifically, the program sets `l` to 'YES' as soon as it finds a single position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]`, but it does not ensure that this holds for all positions. If there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both equal to `c[i]`, the program should output 'NO'. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario because it sets `l` to 'YES' prematurely and only sets it to 'NO' if the loop completes without a `break`, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the template condition holds for all positions in the string. Specifically, we should only set `l` to 'YES' if for every position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` differs from `c[i]`. If we find any position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both equal to `c[i]`, we should immediately set `l` to 'NO' and break out of the loop.
