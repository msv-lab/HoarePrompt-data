Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of cities, a list `a` of `n` integers representing the unique and sorted distances of these cities, an integer `m` representing the number of queries, and for each query, it accepts two integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the indices of two different cities. The function returns, for each query, the index of the city that is closest to the city with index `x_i` but not the city with index `y_i`.**
