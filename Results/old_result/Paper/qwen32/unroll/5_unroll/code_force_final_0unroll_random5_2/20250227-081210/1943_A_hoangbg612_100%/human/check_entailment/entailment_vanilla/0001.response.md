Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c` (Alice's turn) or simply removing them from `a` (Bob's turn). The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`, assuming both players play optimally.

### Optimal Strategy
- **Alice's Goal:** Maximize the MEX of `c`.
- **Bob's Goal:** Minimize the MEX of `c`.

### Key Observations
1. **MEX Calculation:** The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Turn Order:** Alice starts, so she can influence the MEX by strategically choosing numbers.
3. **Count of Numbers:** The optimal strategy involves keeping track of how many times each number appears in `a` and making sure that the smallest missing number is maximized by Alice's choices.

### Program Analysis
The program provided attempts to determine the final MEX after the game. Let's break down its logic:

1. **Input Reading:** It reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2. **Sorting:** It sorts the list `N` of integers.
3. **Tracking Numbers:** It initializes a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in `N`.
4. **Finding MEX:** It iterates through the sorted list and updates the current MEX (`cur`) based on the counts of numbers.
5. **Adjusting MEX:** If the sum of counts in `M` equals `S` (the length of `N`), it increments `cur` by 1.
6. **Handling Single Occurrences:** It creates a list `cnt` of numbers that appear exactly once in `N`. If there are at least two such numbers, it sets `cur` to the second smallest number in `cnt`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation:** The logic for calculating MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the case where numbers are not consecutive or where there are gaps in the sequence of numbers.
2. **Optimal Strategy Ignored:** The program does not account for the optimal moves by both players. It simply counts occurrences and tries to find the MEX, which does not consider the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.
3. **Handling of Counts:** The program does not handle the situation where numbers are chosen optimally by Alice to maximize the MEX.

### Conclusion
Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly compute the MEX after the game, especially considering the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
