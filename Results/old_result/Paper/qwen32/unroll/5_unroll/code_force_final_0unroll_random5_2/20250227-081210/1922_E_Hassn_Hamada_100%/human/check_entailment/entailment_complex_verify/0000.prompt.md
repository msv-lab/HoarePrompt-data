You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of positive integers. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns the tuple `(0, 0)`. The function modifies the `sequence` list by appending additional numbers based on certain calculations, but the final return value is consistently `(0, 0)`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence, but it does not handle the base case correctly and the logic for generating the sequence seems flawed.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that results in exactly X increasing subsequences. However, the return statement `(0, 0)` in the base case does not contribute to the sequence and seems incorrect.

2. The logic inside the loop for generating the sequence is overly complex and does not directly map to the problem of generating an increasing subsequence count.

3. The provided examples in the problem description suggest that the sequence should be carefully constructed to achieve the exact count of increasing subsequences. The current implementation does not seem to follow this logic.

Let's consider a simple example:
- For X = 2, the correct output should be an array with 1 element, as the array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence [0].

However, the provided code does not handle this correctly. The function `func_1` does not generate the correct sequence for X = 2 or other test cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not generate the required array for all potential cases.
