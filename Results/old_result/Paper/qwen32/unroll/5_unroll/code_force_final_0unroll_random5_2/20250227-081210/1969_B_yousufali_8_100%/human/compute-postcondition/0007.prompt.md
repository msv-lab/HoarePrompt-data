You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's), and n and ans are non-negative integers initialized to 0.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: s is a binary string provided by the user input, n is 0, ans is the accumulated sum of (n + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the accumulated sum of (n + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0' in the binary string `s`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a non-negative integer `ans` which is derived from processing a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. The specific processing details are not provided, but the function will compute and return the value of `ans` based on the given binary string `s` and the integer `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
