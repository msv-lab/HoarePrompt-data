In the provided for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, and `int(input())` indicates that the loop will iterate based on the integer value obtained from user input.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the integer value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since the state before the loop starts mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, we can infer that `t` is the value that will be inputted, and thus controls the number of iterations.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is indeed the value that will be inputted and is greater than 0. Given that `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 100, no further adjustment is necessary for `t` itself, but we need to ensure that the input function will provide this value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and `int(input())` returns `t`**
