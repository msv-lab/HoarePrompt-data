Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Probability:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, `n * (n - 1) // 2`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct for the probability of picking any specific pair.
   - However, the way it uses `c` in the subsequent calculations is incorrect. The probability of picking a specific pair in any given excursion is `c`, but the program does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over multiple excursions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of the Sum:**
   - The program sums up the expected contribution of each pair over `k` excursions. However, the way it does this is flawed. It attempts to accumulate the sum `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each excursion, which does not correctly reflect the expected increase in friendship values.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum over `k` excursions, taking into account the increasing friendship values.

3. **Modulo Arithmetic:**
   - While the program uses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) correctly in some places, it does not handle the cumulative sum `s` properly, leading to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum over `k` excursions.
2. Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to account for the increasing friendship values.
3. Ensure all calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here's a sketch of the correct approach:
- For each friend pair `(u, v)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution to the total sum over `k` excursions is:
  \[
  \text{contribution} = f \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{n(n-1)/2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n(n-1)/2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\right)
  \]
- Sum the contributions of all friend pairs.
- Handle non-friend pairs, which contribute 0 to the total sum.

The provided program does not implement these steps correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
