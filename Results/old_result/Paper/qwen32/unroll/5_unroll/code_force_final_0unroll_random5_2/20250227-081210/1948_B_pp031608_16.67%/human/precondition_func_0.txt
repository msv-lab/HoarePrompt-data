lst is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the list represents the array a for a single test case with length n such that 2 <= n <= 50. The function will be called multiple times, each time with a new list representing a different test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^3.
