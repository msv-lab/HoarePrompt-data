The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `y` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.**
