Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly computes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \( n \) and then outputs the cumulative sum of these digit sums for each test case. The program precomputes the cumulative sums up to the maximum possible value of \( n \) (which is \( 2 \times 10^5 \)) and stores them in an array. This allows it to quickly answer each test case by simply indexing into the precomputed array.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. It initializes an array `values` of size \( 2 \times 10^5 + 1 \) to store the cumulative sum of digit sums.
2. It iterates from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), calculates the sum of the digits for each number, and updates the cumulative sum in the `values` array.
3. For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \), and prints the cumulative sum stored in `values[n]`.

This approach ensures that the program can handle up to 10,000 test cases efficiently within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.
