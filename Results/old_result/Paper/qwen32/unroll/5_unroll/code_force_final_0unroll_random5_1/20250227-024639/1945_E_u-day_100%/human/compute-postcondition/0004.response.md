To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how it affects the variables involved.

The given loop iterates over the array `arr` and checks if any element matches the value `k`. If a match is found, it updates the variable `pos` with the index of the matched element. If no match is found after the loop completes, `pos` remains `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`
- `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `pos` is initialized to `-1`
- `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search boundaries in the binary search algorithm
- `st` is a set used to keep track of the midpoints visited during the binary search

The loop does not affect `n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, or `st`. It only modifies `pos` if a match is found.

**Output State:**
- `n` remains the return value of `func_1()`
- `k` remains the return value of `func_1()`
- `arr` remains the return value of `func_2()`
- `pos` is the index of the first element in `arr` that matches `k`, or `-1` if no match is found
- `low` remains unchanged
- `high` remains unchanged
- `st` remains unchanged

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`, `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first element in `arr` that matches `k` or `-1` if no match is found, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search boundaries in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
