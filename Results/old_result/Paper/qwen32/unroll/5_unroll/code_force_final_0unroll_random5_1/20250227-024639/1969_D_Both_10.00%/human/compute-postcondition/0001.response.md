In the given task, the for loop iterates over `sec_arr`, which is a list of tuples. The loop body is omitted, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state of `sec_arr` and `val_a`.

Let's analyze the loop head: `for val_a in sec_arr:`. The loop will execute if `sec_arr` contains at least one tuple. The variable `val_a` will take the value of each tuple in `sec_arr` during each iteration.

Given that `main_ar` is also mentioned in the state, it is not directly involved in the execution of the `for` loop over `sec_arr`. Therefore, we do not need to adjust the state of `main_ar`.

The variable `sub_summ` is also mentioned in the state, but it is not directly involved in the execution of the `for` loop over `sec_arr`. Therefore, we do not need to adjust the state of `sub_summ` for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `sec_arr` must contain at least one tuple. We do not need to specify the exact tuple or its values because the problem statement does not require it.

### Answer:
State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers; `sec_arr` must have at least one tuple; `sub_summ` is 0**.
