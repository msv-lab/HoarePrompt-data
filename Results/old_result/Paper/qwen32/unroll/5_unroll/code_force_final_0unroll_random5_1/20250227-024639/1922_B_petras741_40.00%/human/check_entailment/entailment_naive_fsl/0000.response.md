Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the code does not check the triangle inequality condition, which is essential for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. In this problem, the lengths of the sticks are given as powers of 2, so the lengths are \(2^{a_1}\), \(2^{a_2}\), and \(2^{a_3}\). The triangle inequality conditions for these lengths are:

1. \(2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} > 2^{a_3}\)
2. \(2^{a_1} + 2^{a_3} > 2^{a_2}\)
3. \(2^{a_2} + 2^{a_3} > 2^{a_1}\)

The provided code does not implement these checks. Instead, it seems to be calculating combinations of the same lengths, which is not sufficient to determine if a triangle can be formed.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\). The only combination of three sticks is (2, 4, 8), which does not satisfy the triangle inequality (2 + 4 is not greater than 8). However, the provided code will output a non-zero value because it does not check the triangle inequality conditions.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the triangle inequality conditions required to form a non-degenerate triangle.
