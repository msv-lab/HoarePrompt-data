#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. This function does not take any input parameters and does not contribute directly to the problem's solution based on the provided signature.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is provided by the user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and returns a map object that contains integers. This map object is typically the result of splitting a line of input into individual integer values.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers, which are the result of splitting a line of input into individual integer values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the function signature alone.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers derived from the input string, where the input string consists of space-separated numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers derived from a space-separated input string provided by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_4` does not take any parameters and does not return any specific values based on the provided code snippet. It simply reads input from the standard input and returns it.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a line of input from the standard input and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_5` does not take any parameters and is likely used to read input from the user or a file.
def func_5():
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is a word from the input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings, where each string is a word from the input provided by the user.
