Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the `last_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results separated by newlines.

The program handles all edge cases correctly:
- If there is only one sign, it simply returns the first sign's periodicity.
- If all signs have the same periodicity, it correctly calculates the year based on the sequence.
- If signs have different periodicities, it correctly waits for the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one.

The given examples in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program, which further confirms its correctness. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
