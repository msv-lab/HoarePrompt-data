The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
2. It also states that `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, with `n` being less than `m`.
3. The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('No')`, which directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`, the output will always be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
