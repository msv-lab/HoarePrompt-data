The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum possible sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists after sorting one list in ascending order and the other in descending order. Special cases are handled for lists with identical elements and single-element lists.
