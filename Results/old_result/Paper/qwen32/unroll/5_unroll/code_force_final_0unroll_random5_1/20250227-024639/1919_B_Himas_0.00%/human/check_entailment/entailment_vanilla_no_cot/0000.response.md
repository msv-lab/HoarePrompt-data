Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not correspond to the minimum penalty calculation as defined in the problem.

The correct approach involves finding the optimal way to split the array such that the total penalty is minimized. This requires a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy to determine the best splits. The given program simply computes the difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which is not related to the penalty calculation described.
