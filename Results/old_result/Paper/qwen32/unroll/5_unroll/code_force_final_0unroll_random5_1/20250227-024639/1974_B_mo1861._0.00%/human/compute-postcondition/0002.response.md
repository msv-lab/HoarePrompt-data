Let's analyze the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

The for loop statement is:
```python
for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, the loop iterates over an enumerated list of unique characters from the string `b`, which has been sorted. The loop variables are `i` (the index) and `c` (the character).

### Analysis:
- **`b`**: This is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- **`char_map`**: This is an empty dictionary and is not directly involved in the loop head. Hence, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- **`set(b)`**: This creates a set of unique characters from the string `b`.
- **`sorted(set(b))`**: This sorts the set of unique characters.
- **`enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`**: This enumerates the sorted set of unique characters, providing both the index `i` and the character `c`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop will execute if the sorted set of unique characters from `b` is not empty. This means `b` must contain at least one character.
- The initial state of `i` and `c` will be determined by the first element in the sorted set of unique characters from `b`.

### State Adjustment:
- Since `b` is guaranteed to have a length of at least 1, it already meets the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `b`.
- The variable `char_map` does not need to be adjusted as it is not part of the loop head.
- The loop variables `i` and `c` will be initialized by the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted beforehand.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute. The only relevant state is that `b` must be a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters.

State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `char_map` is an empty dictionary**
