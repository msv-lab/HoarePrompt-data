Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to sort the array using the described operation. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting Numbers**: The program attempts to split numbers greater than 10 but does so in a way that does not ensure the resulting digits are inserted in the correct order or position. It also doesn't handle the case where the number has more than two digits correctly.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The logic for comparing and inserting the split digits is flawed. It doesn't correctly place the digits in the array and doesn't ensure that the array can be sorted after the operation.

3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the modified array `c` is sorted, but the modifications to `c` are incorrect, so this check might not reflect the actual possibility of sorting the array through the described operations.

4. **Function Placement**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which would cause a `NameError`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    while any(x >= 10 for x in a):
        new_a = []
        for x in a:
            if x >= 10:
                new_a.extend(int(d) for d in str(x))
            else:
                new_a.append(x)
        a = new_a
    return a == sorted(a)

m = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        results.append("YES")
    else:
        results.append("NO")

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This version correctly:
- Splits numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their digits.
- Replaces the original number with its digits in the array.
- Checks if the resulting array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.
