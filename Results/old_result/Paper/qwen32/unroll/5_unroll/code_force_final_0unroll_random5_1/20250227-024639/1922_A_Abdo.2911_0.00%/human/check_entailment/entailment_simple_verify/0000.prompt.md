You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
  - Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - String `c` does not match the template `t`.
- The template `t` can have lowercase or uppercase letters.
  - If the i-th letter of `t` is lowercase, the i-th letter of `a` and `b` must match `t`'s i-th letter.
  - If the i-th letter of `t` is uppercase, the i-th letter of `a` and `b` must differ from the lowercase version of `t`'s i-th letter.
- For string `c`, at least one of the above conditions must fail.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows a logical approach:
1. For each character in strings `a` and `b`:
   - If the characters are the same, add the lowercase version of the character to the template.
   - If the characters are different, add the uppercase version of the character to the template.
2. Check if `a` and `b` match the template:
   - If the template character is lowercase, ensure `a` and `b` have the same character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, ensure `a` and `b` have different characters.
3. Check if `c` does not match the template:
   - If the template character is lowercase, ensure `c` has the same character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, ensure `c` has a different character.
4. Print "YES" if both conditions are satisfied for a test case, otherwise print "NO".

### Checking for Edge Cases:
1. **All characters in `a` and `b` are the same**:
   - Template will be all lowercase.
   - If `c` has any character different from `a` and `b`, the condition will hold.
2. **All characters in `a` and `b` are different**:
   - Template will be all uppercase.
   - If `c` has any character the same as `a` or `b`, the condition will hold.
3. **Mixed characters in `a` and `b`**:
   - Template will have a mix of uppercase and lowercase.
   - The condition will hold if `c` violates the template for at least one character.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided examples:
- **Example 1**:
  - `n = 1`, `a = "a"`, `b = "b"`, `c = "c"`
  - Template: "A"
  - `a` and `b` match the template.
  - `c` does not match the template.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct)
- **Example 2**:
  - `n = 2`, `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, `c = "aa"`
  - Template: "AA"
  - `a` and `b` match the template.
  - `c` matches the template.
  - Output: "NO" (Correct)
- **Example 3**:
  - `n = 10`, `a = "mathforces"`, `b = "luckforces"`, `c = "adhoccoder"`
  - Template: "CODEforces"
  - `a` and `b` match the template.
  - `c` does not match the template.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct)
- **Example 4**:
  - `n = 3`, `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, `c = "abc"`
  - Template: "aBd"
  - `a` and `b` match the template.
  - `c` does not match the template.
  - Output: "NO" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it against the provided examples, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and produces the expected output.

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly determines if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not, for all provided examples and potential edge cases.
