The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a formatted string. The string to be printed is explicitly provided as `'1 2'` and does not depend on any variables or the initial state provided.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state describes a list `c` which is set to `[2]` (a list containing a single integer 2) and an integer `m` which is set to `0`.
- The `print` statement is `print(f'1 2')`. This statement prints the string `'1 2'` as it is, without any interpolation or dependency on the variables `c` or `m`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'1 2'`.

Output: **1 2**
