Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summaries to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The beauty can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}| \]

To maximize the beauty, we need to arrange the elements of the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order. Sorting ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, as the absolute differences will be largest between the smallest and largest elements.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**:
   - This function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The function summary suggests that it calculates the beauty of the array after sorting it.
   
2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and uses `func_1` to compute the beauty for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
   - It stores the result of `func_1` for each test case and prints all results at the end.
   - The function summary indicates that it reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty. Sorting in descending order would also work, but sorting in ascending order is used here.
- **Processing Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and storing the results.
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed in the correct order.

### Detailed Validation:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct because sorting maximizes the differences.
  - Example: For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting it gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The beauty is calculated as:
    \[
    (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57
    \]
    This matches the expected output.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results. This is correctly implemented as per the problem description and function summaries.

### Conclusion:
The logic of sorting the array to maximize the beauty is correct, and the input/output handling is appropriately implemented. The program should work as intended for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
