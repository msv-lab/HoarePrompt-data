Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in the function `func_1` does not properly handle the calculation of penalties for all possible splits of the array. Let's analyze why this is the case:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` only counts the number of segments where the balance (sum of +1 and -1) becomes zero or negative. It does not correctly compute the penalties for each segment based on the absolute value of the sum and the length of the segment.

2. **Handling of Balance**: The function resets the balance to zero whenever it becomes negative, which is not the correct approach to determine the optimal split points. The optimal split should be based on minimizing the total penalty, not just counting the number of segments.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle cases where the string is entirely composed of '+' or '-', or where the string alternates between '+' and '-' in a way that does not result in a balance of zero.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

**Input:**
```
1
6
+-+--+
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- One optimal way to split the array is: `[+,-],[+,-,-],[+]`. 
- The penalties for these segments are:
  - `|[+,-]| * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0`
  - `|[+,-,-]| * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3`
  - `|[+]| * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1`
- Total penalty: `0 + 3 + 1 = 4`

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3
```

This example shows that the program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all possible splits of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
