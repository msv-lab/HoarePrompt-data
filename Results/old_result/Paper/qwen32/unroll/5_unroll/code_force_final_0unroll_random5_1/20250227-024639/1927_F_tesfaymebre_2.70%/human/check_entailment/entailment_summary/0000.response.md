### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its components to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a graph defined by its number of vertices (`n`), number of edges (`m`), and a list of edges with their weights.
2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list.
3. **Edge Processing**: The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights.
4. **Cycle Detection**: A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure is used to detect cycles. When a cycle is detected, the lightest edge in the cycle is tracked.
5. **Cycle Reconstruction**: Once a cycle is identified, a Depth-First Search (DFS) is performed starting from one of the nodes of the lightest edge in the cycle to reconstruct the cycle.
6. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the cycle itself.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` correctly handle input reading and parsing.
- **Graph Construction**: In `func_6`, the graph is correctly constructed using an adjacency list, and edges are stored in a list.
- **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is necessary to process the lightest edges last.
- **Cycle Detection**: The DSU structure is used to detect cycles. When a cycle is detected (i.e., two vertices are already in the same set), the lightest edge in the cycle is updated.
- **Cycle Reconstruction**: The DFS function `dfs` is intended to reconstruct the cycle starting from the node of the lightest edge. However, there are a few issues:
  - The `dfs` function is not defined within the scope of `func_6`, so it won't have access to the `graph` variable unless it's passed as an argument.
  - The `dfs` function relies on the `node_u` and `node_v` variables, which are local to `func_6`. These variables should be passed to `dfs` as well.
  - The `colors` list is used to track visited nodes, but it should be initialized within the `dfs` function or passed as an argument to ensure it's reset for each DFS call.
- **Output**: The output format matches the problem description, but the correctness of the cycle reconstruction depends on the correct implementation of the `dfs` function.

#### Correctness:
The provided code has logical issues in the `dfs` function, particularly with variable scope and initialization. These issues need to be addressed for the program to correctly reconstruct and output the cycle.

### Conclusion:
The code is not fully correct due to the issues in the `dfs` function. Therefore:

**Correctness: False**
