Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the decoding process. Specifically, the mapping of characters in the encoded string to the original string is incorrect. The program incorrectly maps each character in the sorted set of the encoded string `b` to a character starting from 'a' and moving forward, which does not align with the encoding procedure described in the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create a set of unique characters and sort them alphabetically
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    # Create a mapping from each character in the sorted set to its symmetric character
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    # Decode the string b using the mapping
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

In this corrected version, the mapping `char_map` is created such that each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters. This aligns with the encoding procedure described in the problem statement.
