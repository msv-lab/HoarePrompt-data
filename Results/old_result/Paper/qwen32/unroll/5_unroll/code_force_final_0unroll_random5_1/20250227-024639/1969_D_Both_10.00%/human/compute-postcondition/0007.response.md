Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers. It calculates a sum by adding the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and then adds the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` if their sum is non-negative. The function returns the calculated sum, which is always 94 in this case.**
