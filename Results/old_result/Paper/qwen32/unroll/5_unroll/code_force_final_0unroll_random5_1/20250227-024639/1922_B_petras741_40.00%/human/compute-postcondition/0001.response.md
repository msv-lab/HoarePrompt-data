The given Python code snippet only initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. `buffer` is an empty list.**
