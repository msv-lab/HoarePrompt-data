To understand the output state, let's break down the code and its logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and an integer `k`.
   - For each test case, an array `a` of length `2n` is provided, containing each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice.
   - Two lists `l` and `r` of length `n` are initialized to zero. These lists will count occurrences of each integer in the first and second halves of the array `a`, respectively.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` are initialized to zero or an empty list. `re` counts the number of elements printed from the right half, `ul` counts the number of elements printed from the left half, `ur` counts the number of elements printed from the right half in the final step, and `res` stores the elements printed from the right half.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The first loop counts how many times each integer appears in the first half of `a` and stores these counts in `l`.
   - The second loop counts how many times each integer appears in the second half of `a` and stores these counts in `r`.

3. **Printing Elements from the Left Half**:
   - The third loop iterates through the first half of `a` and prints integers that appear exactly twice in the first half. It stops once it has printed `2*k` such integers.
   - If it prints `2*k` integers, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it calculates the remaining number of integers it needs to print from the right half (`k = 2*k - ul`).

4. **Printing Elements from the Right Half**:
   - If there are still integers to print (`k > 0`), it iterates through the first half of `a` again and prints integers that appear exactly once in the first half. It stores these integers in `res` and stops once it has printed `k` such integers.
   - It then prints the integers stored in `res`.

5. **Printing Remaining Elements from the Right Half**:
   - If the number of integers printed from the left half (`ul`) is not equal to the number of integers printed from the right half (`ur`), it iterates through the second half of `a` and prints integers that appear exactly twice in the second half. It stops once `ul` equals `ur`.

6. **Output**:
   - The output consists of integers printed in the specified order.

Given the above logic, the output state after all the iterations of the loop will be the printed integers in the specified order, which is a sequence of integers from the array `a` printed based on the conditions described.

Since the output is printed directly and not stored in any variable in the format requested, we can describe the output state in terms of what gets printed:

Output State: **A sequence of integers printed based on the conditions described in the code.**

However, if we need to describe the state of the variables after the loop, it would be:

- `l` and `r` will contain the counts of occurrences of each integer in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
- `ul` will contain the number of integers printed from the left half.
- `ur` will contain the number of integers printed from the right half.
- `res` will contain the integers printed from the right half in the second step.
- `re` will contain the count of integers printed from the right half in the second step.

Given the format requirement, we describe the printed output:

Output State: **A sequence of integers printed based on the conditions described in the code.**
