The initial state provided describes the context of a program, including a list that has undergone certain modifications in a loop, and the result of a function call `func_1(list, n)` which returned `False`. However, the `print('NO')` statement is independent of the specific values or states of the list or the function result. It directly prints the string 'NO'.

Here's the breakdown:
- The list and its elements at positions `i - 1`, `i`, and `i + 1` have been modified in a loop.
- The function `func_1(list, n)` has been called and returned `False`.
- Despite these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will execute and print the string 'NO' as it is hardcoded.

Output: **NO**
