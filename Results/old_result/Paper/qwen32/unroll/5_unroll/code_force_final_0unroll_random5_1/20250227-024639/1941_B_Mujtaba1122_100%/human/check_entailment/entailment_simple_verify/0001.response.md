### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining if all elements of the array can be made zero using a specific operation:
- Choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)).
- Perform the operation: 
  - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
  - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
  - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)

#### Program Analysis

##### Function 1: `func_1`
```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
- **Purpose**: Checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- **Correctness**: This function is correct. It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is not zero; otherwise, it returns `True`.

##### Function 2: `func_2`
```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
- **Purpose**: Attempts to make all elements zero using the specified operation.
- **Issues Identified in the Original Assessment**:
  1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
     - The operation should decrement `list[i + 1]` by `1`, `list[i]` by `2`, and `list[i - 1]` by `1`.
     - The current code incorrectly decrements `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` by `list[i - 1]`.
     - **Annotation Check**: The annotations do not reflect the intended operation logic. They show incorrect decrements, which is a critical issue.
  2. **Early Termination**:
     - The program checks if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the `while` loop and immediately prints 'no' and returns if it is not zero.
     - This is incorrect because the operation might still be applicable to other elements, and the program should continue checking the rest of the array.
     - **Annotation Check**: The annotations do not address this issue, but the logic in the code suggests that the program might terminate prematurely.
  3. **Case Sensitivity**:
     - The problem statement allows for any case in the output ('YES' or 'NO').
     - The program prints 'no' in lowercase, which is not compliant with the problem's requirements.
     - **Annotation Check**: The annotations do not address this issue either.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program contains critical issues that affect its correctness:
1. The operation logic is incorrect.
2. The program might terminate prematurely.
3. The output is not compliant with the case sensitivity requirement.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
