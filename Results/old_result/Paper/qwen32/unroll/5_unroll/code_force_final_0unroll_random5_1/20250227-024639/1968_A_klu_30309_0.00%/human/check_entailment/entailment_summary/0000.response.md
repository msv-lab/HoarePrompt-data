### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer `y` (where 1 â‰¤ y < x) that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`. The provided function `func_1(x)` iterates from `x-1` down to `2` and checks if `y` is a divisor of `x`. If `y` is a divisor and `2*y >= x`, it returns `y` immediately. Otherwise, it keeps track of the largest divisor found (`max_val`) and returns it.

Let's analyze the function's behavior:

1. **Finding the Largest Divisor Less Than or Equal to x/2:**
   - The function iterates from `x-1` down to `2`, checking divisibility.
   - The first divisor found that satisfies `2*y >= x` is returned. This ensures that `gcd(x, y) = y` and thus `gcd(x, y) + y = 2*y`, which is maximized when `y` is as large as possible under the constraint `2*y >= x`.
   - If no such divisor is found, it returns the largest divisor found, which is `max_val`.

2. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The function prioritizes finding the largest `y` such that `2*y >= x` because this maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y` when `gcd(x, y) = y`.
   - If no such `y` exists, the function falls back to the largest divisor found, which is a reasonable approach since it ensures that `gcd(x, y) + y` is still maximized.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `x = 2`, the only possible `y` is `1`, which is correctly returned.
   - For `x = 3`, the only possible `y` is `1`, which is correctly returned.
   - For `x = 10`, `y = 5` is a valid solution because `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10`, which is maximized.
   - For `x = 7`, `y = 6` is a valid solution because `gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7`, which is maximized.
   - For `x = 21`, `y = 18` is a valid solution because `gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 24`, which is maximized.
   - For `x = 100`, `y = 98` is a valid solution because `gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 196`, which is maximized.
   - For `x = 1000`, `y = 750` is a valid solution because `gcd(1000, 750) + 750 = 1250`, which is maximized.
   - For `x = 6`, `y = 3` is a valid solution because `gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6`, which is maximized.

The function seems to correctly handle the problem's constraints and edge cases, returning a `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.

### Correctness: **True**
