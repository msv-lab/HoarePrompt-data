Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Sum Check**: The problem guarantees that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. Therefore, the check `if total % n != 0` is redundant but does not affect correctness.

2. **Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have, `mean = total // n`.

3. **Prefix Sum Check**: The program then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running total of the difference between the current container's water and the mean (`curr += nums[i] - mean`). If at any point this running total becomes negative (`if curr < 0`), it means that there are not enough water units available in the previous containers to distribute to the current container to meet the mean requirement. In this case, the program correctly returns 'NO'.

4. **Final Check**: If the program completes the loop without finding a negative running total, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to distribute the water such that all containers have the same amount.

The logic correctly reflects the constraints of the problem and the allowed operation, ensuring that water can only be transferred from earlier containers to later ones. Thus, the program is correct.
