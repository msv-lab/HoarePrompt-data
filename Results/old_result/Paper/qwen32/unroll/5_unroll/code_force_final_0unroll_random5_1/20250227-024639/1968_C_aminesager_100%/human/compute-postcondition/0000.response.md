Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In this output state, `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer, which is within the range of 1 to 10,000. The preconditions for `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the provided code snippet.
