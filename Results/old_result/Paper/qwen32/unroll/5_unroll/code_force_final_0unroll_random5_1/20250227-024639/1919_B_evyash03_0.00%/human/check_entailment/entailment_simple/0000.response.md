### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into subarrays optimally. However, the logic used in the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of times the balance goes negative and resets it to zero, and adds 1 if the final balance is greater than zero. This approach does not account for the penalty calculation which involves the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.
   - The function does not consider any splitting of the array into subarrays that would minimize the total penalty. Instead, it counts transitions from positive to negative balance and the final state, which is not related to the penalty calculation as described.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the third test case `+-+-+-`, the program calculates the result as `0` because the balance never goes negative and the final balance is `0`. However, the optimal split would be `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` resulting in a penalty of `0` which is correct, but the function's logic does not guarantee this for all cases.
   - For the fifth test case `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the optimal split involves multiple subarrays, but the function's logic does not account for this and instead only counts balance transitions.

3. **Optimal Solution**:
   - An optimal solution would involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach that considers the penalty calculation for different possible splits of the array. The provided function does not implement such a solution.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty based on the given problem description and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
