Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case; `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list where the first 200001 elements contain the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to the respective index, and the rest are 0. The loop has printed the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each `n` provided in the input.**
