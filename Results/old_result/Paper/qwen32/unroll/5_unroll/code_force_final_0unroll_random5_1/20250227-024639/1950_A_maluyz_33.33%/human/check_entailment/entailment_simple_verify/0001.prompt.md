You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `i` will be equal to `t`. The state of `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if three digits (a, b, c) form a "stair", "peak", or neither.
  - A "stair" is when a < b < c.
  - A "peak" is when a < b > c.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads three integers. It then checks the conditions as follows:
1. `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a "stair". If true, it prints "STAIR".
2. `elif a == b == c:` checks if all three digits are equal. If true, it prints "NONE". However, this condition is unnecessary because if a == b == c, neither "STAIR" nor "PEAK" conditions will be met, and the `else` clause will handle it correctly.
3. `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` checks if b is the maximum digit. If true, it prints "PEAK". This condition is generally correct for identifying a peak (a < b > c), but it does not explicitly check the conditions a < b and b > c. However, since the first condition (stair) is checked first, this will only execute if a < b and b > c, which means it correctly identifies a peak.
4. `else:` if none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly identifies "STAIR" when a < b < c.
- The program correctly identifies "PEAK" when a < b > c.
- The program correctly identifies "NONE" when neither of the above conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem. The unnecessary condition `elif a == b == c:` does not affect the correctness of the solution but can be removed for clarity.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
