### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and its annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap
We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is "good" based on the following criteria:
1. There exists an array `b` such that the sum of elements in `c[l_i:r_i]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. For every index `i` in the range `[l_i, r_i]`, `c[i] != b[i]`.
3. Every element `b[i]` is greater than 0.

#### Program Analysis
The program uses prefix sums to efficiently determine if a subarray is good. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ones[i]` keeps track of the number of 1s in the subarray `c[0:i-1]`.
   - `sum[i]` keeps track of the sum of the subarray `c[0:i-1]` minus the count of elements in that range (i.e., `sum[i] = sum(c[0:i-1]) - (i-1)`).

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the adjusted sum (`sumInRange`) in the subarray `c[l_i-1:r_i]`.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is checked to determine if the subarray is good.

#### Condition Analysis
Let's analyze the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`:
- `onesInRange` counts the number of 1s in the subarray.
- `(r - l + 1)` is the length of the subarray.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in that range.

The condition can be simplified to:
\[ \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange} + \text{onesInRange} \]
\[ r - l + 1 \leq \text{sumInRange} + \text{onesInRange} - \text{onesInRange} \]
\[ r - l + 1 \leq \text{sumInRange} \]

This means that the length of the subarray must be less than or equal to the sum of the subarray minus the number of 1s. This condition is derived from the need to ensure that we can create a new array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `c` and all elements in `b` are greater than 0.

#### Edge Cases
Let's verify the program with the provided edge cases:

1. **Single Element Subarray**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Query: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: A single element cannot satisfy `a_i != b_i` and `b_i > 0`.

2. **Subarrays with All Elements Equal**:
   - Input: `1 1 2 2 2`
   - Query: `1 3`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: The subarray `[2, 2, 2]` can be transformed into `[1, 1, 3]` or `[3, 1, 1]` etc.

3. **Subarrays with Mixed Elements**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 2 3`
   - Query: `1 3`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: The subarray `[1, 2, 3]` can be transformed into `[2, 1, 4]` or `[4, 1, 2]` etc.

The program correctly handles these cases. The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` ensures that the subarray can be transformed into a valid array `b`.

#### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and testing, the program correctly determines if a subarray is good according to the problem description. No issues were found that would make the program incorrect.
