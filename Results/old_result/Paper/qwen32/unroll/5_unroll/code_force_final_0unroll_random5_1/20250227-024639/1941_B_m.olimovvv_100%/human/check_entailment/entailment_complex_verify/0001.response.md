### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several flaws in the provided program. Let's break down the issues and evaluate the program's correctness:

1. **Operation Logic**:
   - The provided program attempts to simulate the operation by modifying the array elements in a loop. However, the logic is flawed. The operation should be applied in a way that ensures all elements can be reduced to zero without any intermediate negative values.
   - The current implementation modifies the array in a way that doesn't necessarily reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the operation `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` can lead to negative values if not handled correctly.

2. **Negative Value Check**:
   - The program includes a check `if b[i] < 0:` which is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that all elements are non-negative. However, even if this check were necessary, it would not be sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zeros.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The program checks only the last two elements of the modified array to determine if they are zero. This is insufficient because the operation can affect earlier elements as well, and the logic does not ensure that all elements are zero.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The provided program does not correctly simulate the operation and does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero. The logic is flawed, and the program does not handle the problem requirements correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the program's logic and its inability to correctly determine if all elements of the array can be reduced to zero using the described operations.

**Final: **False**
