You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a string consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', finds the index of the first 'B' and the last 'B' in the string, and prints the length of the string minus the sum of these two indices.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a horizontal strip of `n` cells, each either white ('W') or black ('B').
- We need to paint a continuous segment of cells white to turn all cells white.
- The goal is to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the input, finds the first occurrence of 'B' from the left (`ind1`), and the first occurrence of 'B' from the right (`ind2`). It then calculates the length of the segment that needs to be painted as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Single 'B' Case**: If there's only one 'B' in the string, the program should output `1`, which it does correctly.
2. **Multiple 'B's Case**: The program calculates the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B'. This approach works for cases where all 'B's are contiguous or where the shortest segment containing all 'B's is from the first to the last 'B'. However, it does not consider cases where there might be a shorter segment that includes all 'B's.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input string "WBBWWBBW". The first 'B' is at index `1` and the last 'B' is at index `6`. The program will output `6 - 1 + 1 = 6`. However, the minimum segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white is "BBWWBB" (from index `1` to `6`), which is indeed `6`. But let's consider another case:

- Input: "WBWBWWB"
- The first 'B' is at index `1` and the last 'B' is at index `6`.
- The program will output `6 - 1 + 1 = 6`.
- However, the minimum segment that needs to be painted white is "BWBWWB" (from index `1` to `6`), which is `6`. But if we consider the segment "BWBWW" (from index `1` to `5`), it is `5` and includes all 'B's.

The correct minimum segment is actually "BWBWW" (from index `1` to `5`), which is `5` cells long. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, specifically when there is a shorter segment that includes all 'B's compared to the segment from the first to the last 'B'.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle cases where there is a shorter segment that includes all 'B's compared to the segment from the first to the last 'B'. For example, in the input "WBWBWWB", the program outputs `6` instead of the correct answer `5`.
