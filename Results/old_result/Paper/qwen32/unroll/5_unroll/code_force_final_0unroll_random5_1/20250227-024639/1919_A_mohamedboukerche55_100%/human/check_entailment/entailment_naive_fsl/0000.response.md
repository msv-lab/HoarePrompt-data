Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program determines the winner of the game based on whether the sum of coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this logic does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob in the game.

Let's analyze the game mechanics:
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- They can either swap wallets or keep their current wallets.
- They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.

The key insight is that the player who starts with an odd number of coins in total (sum of both wallets) will always win if both play optimally. This is because the game essentially reduces to a Nim game with a single pile of coins, and the player who starts with an odd number of coins can always force the other player into a losing position.

Here's a counterexample where the provided program fails:
- Input: `1 3`
- Expected Output: `Alice`
- Program Output: `Bob`

In this case, Alice can always win by swapping wallets and ensuring she always has an odd number of coins. Here's a possible sequence of moves:
1. Alice swaps wallets: `a=3, b=1`
2. Bob chooses not to swap: `a=2, b=1`
3. Alice chooses not to swap: `a=1, b=1`
4. Bob chooses not to swap: `a=0, b=1`
5. Alice swaps wallets: `a=1, b=0`
6. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Since the program does not correctly implement the logic based on the total number of coins being odd or even, it fails in this and other similar cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
