### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` randomly chosen pairs of friends over multiple test cases. The friendship values of chosen pairs increase by 1 each time they are chosen. The expected value needs to be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) and the result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is correct for calculating the probability of choosing any specific pair.
   - However, the loop `for i in range(k):` does not correctly compute the expected value. It incorrectly adds a linear term and a constant term without considering the cumulative effect of choosing pairs and updating their friendship values.

2. **Handling of Friendship Values:**
   - The code sums the initial friendship values and then attempts to calculate an expected value, but it does not account for the fact that the friendship values change over time as pairs are chosen.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability `c` is correctly calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, but it is used incorrectly in the loop. The expected value should consider the probability of each pair being chosen and the updated friendship values.

4. **Loop Over k Excursions:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` is not correctly updating the expected value. The expected value should be computed by considering the cumulative effect of choosing pairs over `k` excursions, taking into account the updated friendship values.

#### Detailed Explanation:
The correct approach involves:
- Calculating the initial expected value based on the initial friendship values.
- Simulating the process of choosing pairs and updating their friendship values over `k` excursions.
- Calculating the cumulative expected value considering the probability of choosing each pair and the updated friendship values.

The provided code does not correctly simulate this process. Instead, it incorrectly sums the initial friendship values and attempts to add a linear term, which does not account for the dynamic nature of the problem.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key points, but they do not challenge the incorrect logic or provide a correct path for calculating the expected value.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The program fails to account for the dynamic updates to the friendship values and the correct probability calculations.

**Final: False**
