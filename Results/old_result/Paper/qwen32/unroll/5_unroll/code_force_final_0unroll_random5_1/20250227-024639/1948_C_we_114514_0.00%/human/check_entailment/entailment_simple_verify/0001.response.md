### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two strings of length `n` representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid.
   - These inputs are stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes two boolean variables: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
     - `reachable_first_row` is initially set to `True` because the robot starts at (1, 1).
     - `reachable_second_row` is initially set to `False` because the robot cannot start at (2, 1).
   - The program iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
       - If the arrow at `row1[j]` points right (`'>'`):
         - If `j` is the last column (`n-1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can potentially move to (2, n).
       - If the arrow at `row1[j]` points left (`'<'`):
         - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` because the robot cannot move further left in the first row.
         - If the arrow at `row2[j]` points right (`'>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move from (1, j) to (2, j) and then move right.
     - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
       - If the arrow at `row2[j]` points right (`'>'`):
         - If `j` is the last column (`n-1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (though this line is redundant since `reachable_second_row` is already `True`).

#### Issues Identified:
- **Movement Logic:** The program incorrectly assumes that if the robot is in the first row and the arrow points left, it cannot move further left. However, the robot can move up to the second row first and then move left.
- **Up/Down Movement:** The program does not consider the possibility of moving up or down in the grid, which is crucial for reaching the target cell (2, n). Specifically, the robot can move from (1, j) to (2, j) or vice versa at any column.
- **Redundancy:** The line `if j == n - 1: reachable_second_row = True` inside the `if reachable_second_row` block is redundant because `reachable_second_row` is already `True`.

#### Correct Approach:
- The robot should be able to move up or down at any column based on the arrow directions.
- The correct logic should track if the robot can reach the last column in either row by considering all possible movements (left, right, up, down).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the provided problem description. The program fails to account for the ability of the robot to move vertically between rows.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
