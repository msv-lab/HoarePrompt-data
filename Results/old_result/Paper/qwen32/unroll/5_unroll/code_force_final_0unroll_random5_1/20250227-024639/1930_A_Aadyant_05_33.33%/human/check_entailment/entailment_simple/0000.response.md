### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by optimally pairing the integers. The optimal strategy is to sort the integers and then pair the smallest integers together. This is because the score is increased by the minimum of the two integers in each pair, and sorting ensures that the smallest integers are paired, thereby maximizing the sum of the minimums.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
   
3. **Pairing and Summing**:
   - It then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score. This effectively pairs the smallest integers together.
   - The score for each test case is the sum of these selected elements.
   
4. **Output**:
   - The final scores for each test case are printed.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the input for the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of pairs and the list of integers.
- It sorts the list of integers.
- It sums the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) which correspond to the minimums in the optimally paired list.
- It stores each test case's result in the list `out` and prints them at the end.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the optimal strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest integers together. The provided execution states match the expected behavior of the program based on the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
