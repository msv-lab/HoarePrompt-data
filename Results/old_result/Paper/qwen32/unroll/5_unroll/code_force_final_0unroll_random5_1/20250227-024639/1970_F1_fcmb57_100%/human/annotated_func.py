#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99, and a is odd); b is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and b is odd). The field is represented by a list of a strings, where each string contains b pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities in the field. The next input is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000), followed by T lines, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (x + dx, y + dy), which is (a + b, a + b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, each a tuple of two integers. It returns a tuple where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.
