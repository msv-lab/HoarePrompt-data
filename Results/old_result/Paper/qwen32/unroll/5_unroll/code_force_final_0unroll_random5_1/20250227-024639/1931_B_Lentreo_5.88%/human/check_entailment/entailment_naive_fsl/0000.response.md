Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed and does not properly account for the conditions required to equalize the water levels in all containers.

Let's analyze the given program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `curr`:** The program calculates `curr` by iterating through `nums` and adding `i - last` for each non-zero `i`. This does not correctly check if the water can be evenly distributed. The logic should instead ensure that the cumulative sum of water levels up to any point can be adjusted to the average level.

2. **Ignoring the Average Level:** The problem requires that the sum of water levels is divisible by `n`, meaning each container should ideally have `total_sum / n` units of water. The program does not calculate or use this average level to check if the water can be distributed correctly.

3. **No Handling of Prefix Sums:** The correct approach involves using prefix sums and checking if the cumulative difference can be adjusted to reach the average level for all containers.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Calculate the target level of water for each container, which is `total_sum / n`.
- Use prefix sums to check if the cumulative difference can be adjusted to reach this target level.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        target = total_sum // n
        prefix_sum = 0
        can_equalize = True
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += nums[i]
            if prefix_sum % n != (target * (i + 1)) % n:
                can_equalize = False
                break
        print('YES' if can_equalize else 'NO')

# Example input handling
func()
```

This corrected program correctly checks if the water can be evenly distributed by ensuring that the prefix sums align with the expected cumulative target levels.
