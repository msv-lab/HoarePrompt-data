The code snippet `a = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. This input does not affect the value of `t` or the coordinates of the squares, but it does introduce a new variable `a` with the value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each of the `t` test cases, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; `a` is an input integer.**
