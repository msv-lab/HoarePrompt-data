You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1

    3
    
    7 1 0

    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it performs a series of operations on the list and prints 'YES' if the final two elements of the modified list are zero and all previous elements were non-negative during the process; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Index Handling**: The loop iterates from `0` to `a - 2`, which means it starts from the first element (`b[0]`) and tries to perform operations. However, the operation can only be applied starting from the second element (`b[1]`), up to the second last element (`b[a-2]`).

2. **Incorrect Array Modification**: The operation modifies `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` based on the value of `b[i]`. However, the logic `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that `b[i]` should be reduced by 1, `b[i+1]` by 2, and `b[i+2]` by 1. The correct logic should be:
   ```python
   b[i] -= 1
   b[i + 1] -= 2
   b[i + 2] -= 1
   ```
   But this logic should only be applied if `b[i]`, `b[i+1]`, and `b[i+2]` are sufficient to accommodate these reductions.

3. **Incorrect Break Condition**: The loop breaks if `b[i]` is negative, but this is not a valid condition since `b[i]` should never be negative due to the problem constraints. Instead, the program should check if the values of `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` are sufficient to perform the operation.

4. **Final Check**: The final check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0` is correct, but the logic leading up to this check is flawed.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] >= 2 and a[i + 1] >= 1:
                x = min(a[i] // 2, a[i + 1])
                a[i] -= 2 * x
                a[i + 1] -= x
                a[i - 1] -= x
        if all(x == 0 for x in a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the operations are applied correctly and checks if all elements can be reduced to zero.
