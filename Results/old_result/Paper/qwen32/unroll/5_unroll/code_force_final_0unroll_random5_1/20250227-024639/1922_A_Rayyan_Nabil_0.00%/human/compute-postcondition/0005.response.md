Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length. For each test case, it checks if each character in string `c` matches at least one of the corresponding characters in strings `a` or `b`. If this condition is met for all characters in `c`, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.**
