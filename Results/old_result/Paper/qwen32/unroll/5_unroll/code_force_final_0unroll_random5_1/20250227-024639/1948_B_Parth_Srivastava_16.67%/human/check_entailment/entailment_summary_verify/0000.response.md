### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits.
- The program should output "YES" if it's possible to sort the array after any number of splits; otherwise, it should output "NO".

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the array `a`.
   - Iterates through the array `a` and checks if an element is greater than 10.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and appends them to the list `c`.
   - The logic for splitting and appending digits is flawed, as it does not correctly handle all cases.
   - After processing, it checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - For each test case, the program checks the corresponding value in `b` and prints "YES" if the value is `1` and "NO" otherwise.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function summary states that `func_1` processes a list of integers, rearranges certain elements based on specific conditions, and appends either `1` or `0` to a list `b` depending on whether the rearranged list is sorted.
- However, the summary does not reflect the flawed logic within `func_1`.

#### Specific Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The code incorrectly handles the insertion of digits. For example, if an element is `10`, it should be split into `1` and `0`, but the current logic might not handle this correctly.
   - The code does not handle the case where splitting an element results in digits that should be placed in a specific order to achieve a sorted array.

2. **Incorrect Sorted Check:**
   - The code checks if the list `c` is sorted immediately after processing the array. However, this does not account for all possible ways to split the numbers and achieve a sorted array.

#### Test Case Verification:
Let's verify the original assessment with the provided test case:
- **Test Case:**
  ```
  1
  3
  9 11 10
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  YES
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - The array `[9, 11, 10]` can be transformed into `[9, 1, 1, 1, 0]` by splitting `11` into `1` and `1`, and `10` into `1` and `0`.
  - The resulting array `[9, 1, 1, 1, 0]` can be rearranged to `[0, 1, 1, 1, 9]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Actual Output of the Program:**
  - The program will output `NO` because it does not correctly handle the logic for splitting numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The specific issues in the code, particularly the incorrect splitting logic and the immediate sorted check, lead to incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
