To ensure that the `for` loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is iterating over `expression`, which is a string. The loop will execute if there is at least one character in the string `expression`.

Given the initial state:
- `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters "+" and "-".
- `length` is an integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000.
- `count` is 0.
- `balance` is 0.

The only variable in the loop head is `char`, which will take on each character of `expression` in turn. The loop will execute if `expression` has at least one character.

Since `length` is already given to be in the range 1 to 5000, it implies that `expression` will always have at least one character. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `expression` or `length` to ensure the loop executes. The variables `count` and `balance` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to start executing.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters "+" and "-", `length` is an integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `count` is 0, `balance` is 0**
