`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
