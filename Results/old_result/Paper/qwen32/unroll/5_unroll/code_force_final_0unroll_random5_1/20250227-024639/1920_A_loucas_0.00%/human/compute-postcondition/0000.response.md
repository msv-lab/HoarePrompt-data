The code snippet `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. This input is expected to be the number of test cases, `t`, as per the initial state description. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is the value of `t` read from the input.**
