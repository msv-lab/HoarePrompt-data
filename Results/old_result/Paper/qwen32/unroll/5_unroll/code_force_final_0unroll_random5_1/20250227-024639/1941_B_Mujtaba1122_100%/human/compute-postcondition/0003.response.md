The initial state provided describes the state of a list after undergoing certain loop operations, and it mentions that the function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`. However, the print statement in the code snippet is simply `print('YES')`, which directly prints the string 'YES' regardless of the state of the list or the return value of `func_1`.

Since there are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that depend on the list or the return value of `func_1`, the output will always be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
