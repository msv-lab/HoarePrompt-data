### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given rules. Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Input Parsing:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
- It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

#### Initial Checks:
- The program checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are equal to the maximum score in the array `a`.
  - If both have the maximum score, it prints "Draw".
  - If Bodya has the maximum score, it prints "Bodya".
  - If Sasha has the maximum score, it prints "Sasha".

#### Simulating the Game:
- The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
- It keeps track of the scores for both players (`b` for Bodya and `s` for Sasha) and whether they have reached the maximum score (`foundb` and `founds`).
- For each turn, it updates the scores and positions of both players unless they have already found the maximum score.

#### Calculating Total Scores:
- The program calculates the total scores for both players by summing up the scores from each turn.
- It also calculates the potential maximum scores for both players if they were to stay at their current positions for the remaining turns.

#### Determining the Winner:
- The program compares the maximum potential scores of both players.
- It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's potential score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's potential score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

#### Analysis:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where both players start at the maximum score.
  - It also correctly handles the case where one player starts at the maximum score.
  
- **Simulation:**
  - The simulation for `k` turns is done correctly, considering the movement based on the permutation and the score accumulation based on the array `a`.
  
- **Potential Scores:**
  - The calculation of potential maximum scores is correct, taking into account the remaining turns after reaching the maximum score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" as per the problem description. It handles all edge cases and simulates the game accurately.

### Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
