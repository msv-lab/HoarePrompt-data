### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible to sort an array by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. The program's logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

Let's break down the program's logic and identify the issues:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is correct as it processes each test case separately.
   
2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, the program reads `n` (the number of elements in the array) and the array `arr` itself. This is also correct.

3. **Sorting Logic**: The program then iterates through the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds an element `arr[i]` that is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, it attempts to split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and check if the resulting array is sorted. However, this approach is incorrect for several reasons:
   - **Incorrect Splitting**: The program only splits the larger element (`arr[i - 1]`) and checks if the resulting array (including `arr[i]`) is sorted. It should consider all possible splits and their effects on the entire array.
   - **Limited Scope**: The program only checks if the immediate neighbors are sorted after splitting, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.
   - **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program does not handle multiple splits correctly. For example, if `arr[i - 1]` is a large number, it might need to be split multiple times to achieve a sorted array, and the program does not account for this.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations, otherwise "NO". However, due to the flawed logic in the sorting check, the output is not always correct.

### Example of Flawed Logic:
Consider the test case `3 12 28 5`. The program will compare `28` and `5`, see that `5` is less than `28`, and attempt to split `28` into `[2, 8, 5]`. Since `[2, 8, 5]` is not sorted, the program incorrectly concludes that the array cannot be sorted. However, the correct sequence of operations would be to split `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which can then be transformed into `[1, 2, 5, 28]` by splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and then inserting `5` between `2` and `8`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
