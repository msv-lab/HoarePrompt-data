### Reasoning:

The provided code is attempting to solve the problem by first reading the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the number `k`. It then reads the list of card numbers. 

The logic of the code is as follows:
1. If `k` is greater than `n`, the number of cards, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed.
2. Otherwise, it calls the function `func_1` which creates a frequency table of the card numbers, but caps the frequency at `k`.
3. After obtaining the frequency table, it checks if `k` is a value in the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`.

However, this logic does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. It simply caps the frequency of each card at `k`, but this does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left.
- The check `if k in freq.values():` is incorrect. The value `k` in the frequency table does not directly translate to the minimum number of cards left. The logic to reduce the number of cards based on the given operation is not implemented correctly.
- The overall approach does not consider the optimal way to reduce the number of cards using the allowed operations.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations. It lacks the proper logic to simulate the operations and compute the correct result.
