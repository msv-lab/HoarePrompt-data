**Reasoning:**

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution.

The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's) using the minimum number of cyclic shifts on any substring, where the cost of each cyclic shift is the length of the substring.

The key observation here is that the minimum cost to sort the string can be determined by counting the number of '1's that appear before each '0'. For each such '0', the cost to move all the preceding '1's to its left is the number of those '1's plus one (to include the '0' itself in the cyclic shift).

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the provided program:
- The function `func_1` initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0. `one` keeps track of the number of '1's encountered so far.
- As the function iterates through the string, it increments `one` for each '1'.
- When a '0' is encountered and `one` is greater than 0 (indicating there are '1's before this '0'), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This represents the cost to move all the '1's before this '0' to its left.
- Finally, the function returns the total `cost`.

This logic correctly calculates the minimum cost required to sort the string by moving all '1's to the right of all '0's. The provided example cases in the problem statement align with this logic as well.

**Correctness: True**
