Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is expected to be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The conditions for `a` and `b` in the test cases remain unchanged.
