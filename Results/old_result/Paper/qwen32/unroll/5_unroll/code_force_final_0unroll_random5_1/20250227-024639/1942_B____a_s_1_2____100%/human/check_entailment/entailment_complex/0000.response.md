### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to construct a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the relationship \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The program iterates through the array `a` in reverse order, calculating the corresponding value of `p` by using the formula \( p_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \).

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the given program. The program initializes `mex` to `n` and updates it as `mex = min(mex, p[i])` after calculating `p[i]`. This approach does not correctly compute the MEX for the current prefix of `p` because the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not yet in the current prefix of `p`.

To correctly compute the MEX, we need to keep track of which integers have already been used in the permutation `p`. A common way to do this is to use a set to store the used integers and then find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
        
        print(*p)

func()
```

In this corrected version, we initialize `mex` to 0 and use a set `used` to keep track of the integers that have been used in `p`. After calculating `p[i]`, we add it to the set `used` and then increment `mex` until we find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used`.

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly compute the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` because it incorrectly calculates the MEX. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
