### Reasoning

The provided program aims to determine the minimum penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` of `+` and `-` characters. The penalty is calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of subarrays multiplied by their lengths.

Let's break down the program's logic and see if it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Splitting Strategy**:
   - The program splits the string `s` by the character `-` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts. This step seems to be a preliminary attempt to split the string, but it does not directly relate to the optimal splitting strategy described in the problem.
   
2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string `expression` and maintains a `balance` that increments with `+` and decrements with `-`.
   - When the `balance` goes negative, it resets the `balance` to 0 and increments the `count`.
   - After processing the entire string, if the `balance` is greater than 0, it increments the `count` by 1.
   - The final `count` represents the number of segments where the cumulative sum was negative at some point, plus an additional segment if the final balance is positive.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program's approach does not directly calculate the penalty as defined in the problem statement. Instead, it seems to count the number of segments where the balance went negative and adds one if the final balance is positive. This count does not equate to the minimum penalty, which requires calculating the sum of penalties of the subarrays formed by optimal splitting.

4. **Optimal Splitting**:
   - The optimal splitting strategy involves finding a way to split the array such that the sum of the penalties of the subarrays is minimized. This requires more sophisticated logic than simply counting when the balance goes negative.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the optimal splitting strategy to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. The provided logic does not align with the required penalty calculation based on the sum of penalties of the subarrays formed by the optimal splitting.
