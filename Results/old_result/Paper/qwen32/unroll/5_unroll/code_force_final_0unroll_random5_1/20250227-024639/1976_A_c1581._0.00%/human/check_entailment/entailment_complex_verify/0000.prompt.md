You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password`; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password`.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` if there is at least one digit; otherwise, it is -1.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` if there is at least one digit; otherwise, it is -1. The list `digits` is sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` if there is at least one digit; otherwise, it is -1. The list `digits` is sorted. The list `letters` is sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if the input `password` string meets specific criteria: all digits must appear before any letters, and both digits and letters must be in non-decreasing order. If the password meets these criteria, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly check the condition that all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order and all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. The code checks if the digits and letters in the password are sorted, but it does not ensure that the digits and letters themselves are sorted within their respective groups in the password.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
a1b2c3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- The password contains both letters and digits.
- The letters 'a', 'b', 'c' are in non-decreasing order.
- The digits '1', '2', '3' are in non-decreasing order.
- However, the digit '1' comes after the letter 'a', and the digit '2' comes after the letter 'b', which violates the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

**Program Output:**
The provided program will output "YES" for this input because it checks the sorted order of digits and letters separately but does not enforce the condition that all digits must come after all letters.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that all digits come after all letters and that both groups are sorted. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if all letters are before any digits
    if any(char.isdigit() for char in letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if all digits are after any letters
    if any(char.isalpha() for char in digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if digits are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected code ensures that all letters come before any digits and that both groups are sorted.
