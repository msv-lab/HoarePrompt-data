You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is given in the first line of the input.

    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1

            last_year = next_year
        
        results.append(str(last_year))
        
    #State: - `data` remains `["3", "2", "1", "2", "3", "2", "5"]`.
    #- `input` remains the entire input as provided.
    #- `index` is `7` (since it has been incremented by `1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2`).
    #- `T` remains `3`.
    #- `results` is `["2", "5", "5"]`.
    #
    #Output State:
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n` integers representing the periodicities of signs. For each test case, it calculates the year in which all signs will next flash simultaneously and writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains a single integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains an integer `n` (number of signs).
     - The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (periodicities of the signs).
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Logic:**
   - The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
   - The signs must occur sequentially. If the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe waits for the (i+1)-th sign starting from year `x+1`.

### Solution Breakdown
The provided Python program reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs. Here’s how it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The entire input is read at once and split into a list of strings.
   - The number of test cases `T` is extracted.
   - For each test case, the number of signs `n` is read, followed by the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The first sign occurs in the year `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, the year of its occurrence is calculated as:
     - `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`
     - This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - The `last_year` is updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, each on a new line.

### Verification with Example
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Year of 1st sign: `3`
   - Year of 2nd sign: `(3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
   - Year of 3rd sign: `(4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
   - Year of 4th sign: `(8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
   - Year of 5th sign: `(10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
   - Year of 6th sign: `(18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches expected output)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Year of 1st sign: `1`
   - Year of 2nd sign: `(1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2`
   - Year of 3rd sign: `(2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3`
   - Year of 4th sign: `(3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4`
   - Year of 5th sign: `(4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (matches expected output)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - All signs occur every year starting from 1.
   - Output: `5` (matches expected output)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - Year of 1st sign: `50`
   - Year of 2nd sign: `(50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60`
   - Year of 3rd sign: `(60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 771`
   - Year of 4th sign: `(771 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 1000`
   - Year of 5th sign: `(1000 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1512`
   - Year of 6th sign: `(1512 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (matches expected output)

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case based on the given periodicities and sequential occurrence requirement. Thus, the program is correct.
