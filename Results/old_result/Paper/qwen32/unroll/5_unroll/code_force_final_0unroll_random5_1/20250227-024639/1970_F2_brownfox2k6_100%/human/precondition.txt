N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99. P is an integer such that 1 <= P <= 10. The field is a 2D list of size N x M where each element is a string representing either an empty cell (".."), a player ("R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9"), a goal ("RG", "BG"), the Quaffle (".Q"), or the Bludger (".B"). T is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000. Each action in the list of actions is a string that describes a valid move or action by an entity on the field.
