### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the given periodicities and the sequential occurrence requirement. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness using the function summary and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It extracts the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Year:**
   - The first sign occurs in the year `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, the program calculates the year of its occurrence using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - The `last_year` is updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, each on a new line.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Year of 1st sign: `3`
   - Year of 2nd sign: `(3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
   - Year of 3rd sign: `(4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
   - Year of 4th sign: `(8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
   - Year of 5th sign: `(10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
   - Year of 6th sign: `(18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches expected output)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Year of 1st sign: `1`
   - Year of 2nd sign: `(1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2`
   - Year of 3rd sign: `(2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3`
   - Year of 4th sign: `(3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4`
   - Year of 5th sign: `(4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (matches expected output)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - All signs occur every year starting from 1.
   - Output: `5` (matches expected output)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - Year of 1st sign: `50`
   - Year of 2nd sign: `(50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60`
   - Year of 3rd sign: `(60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 771`
   - Year of 4th sign: `(771 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 1000`
   - Year of 5th sign: `(1000 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1512`
   - Year of 6th sign: `(1512 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (matches expected output)

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case based on the given periodicities and sequential occurrence requirement. The logic and implementation are accurate, and the output matches the expected results for all test cases.

**Final: True**
