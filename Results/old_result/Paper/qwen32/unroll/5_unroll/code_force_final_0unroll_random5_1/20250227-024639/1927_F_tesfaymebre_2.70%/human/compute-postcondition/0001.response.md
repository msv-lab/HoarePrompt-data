The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given that `test_cases` holds the return value of `func_1()`, we need to ensure that the return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`test_cases` holds the return value of `func_1()` which must be greater than 0**
