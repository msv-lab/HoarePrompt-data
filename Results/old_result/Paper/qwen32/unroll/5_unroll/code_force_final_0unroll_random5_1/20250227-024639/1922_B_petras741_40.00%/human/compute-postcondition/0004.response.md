Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Each `a_i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided integers.**
