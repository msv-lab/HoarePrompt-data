Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case; `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list named `values` with 200001 elements, all set to zero. The other variables (`t` and `inf`) remain unchanged.
