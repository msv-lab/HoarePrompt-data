The code snippet initializes a list named `sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, and `ones`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; there are `q` queries, and for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to `0`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to `0`.**
