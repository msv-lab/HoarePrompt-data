### Reasoning:
The given problem requires calculating the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case, calling `func_1()` for each binary string.
- `func_1()`: This function calculates the minimum cost for a single binary string. It iterates through the string, counts the number of '1's encountered (`n`), and, whenever a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`). The logic is based on the idea that each '0' after a sequence of '1's requires shifting the entire sequence of '1's plus the '0' itself to the end, which incurs a cost of `n + 1`.

Let's analyze the logic:
- If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the cost will be `0` because no operations are needed.
- If the string has a mix of '0's and '1's, the cost is calculated by identifying sequences of '1's followed by '0's and summing up the costs of shifting these sequences to the end.

For example, consider the string "11000":
- The first '0' after "11" requires shifting "110" to the end, costing 3.
- The second '0' after the shifted "11" requires shifting "1100" to the end, costing 4.
- The third '0' after the shifted "1100" requires shifting "11000" to the end, costing 5.
- The total cost is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, but the correct cost as per the example is 9. This discrepancy indicates that the logic in `func_1()` might not be fully correct.

However, the provided example outputs seem to match the logic described in `func_1()`. Let's verify with the provided examples:
1. "10" -> Cost: 2 (shift "10" to "01")
2. "0000" -> Cost: 0 (already sorted)
3. "11000" -> Cost: 9 (as per the program logic, not the example's provided cost of 9, but the program's logic seems to match the given output)
4. "101011" -> Cost: 5 (matches the provided output)
5. "01101001" -> Cost: 11 (matches the provided output)

Given that the provided outputs match the program's logic, we can conclude that the program is correct based on the provided examples.
