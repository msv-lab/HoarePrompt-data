The provided code snippet is a function definition with a docstring that describes the intended behavior of the function. However, the function body is not provided, so we can only infer the output based on the description in the docstring.

Given the initial state and the function description, the function is supposed to generate a sequence based on the input `number` and return the size of the generated sequence. However, the function also mentions an argument `sequence` which is not used in the description of the return value, and it is not clear how this argument is supposed to be handled or modified.

Since the function body is not provided, we can only assume that the function will generate a sequence and return its length. The precondition states that `number` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function.

Since the function is not actually executed and no code is provided to modify `sequence` or compute its length, we cannot determine the exact length of the sequence or its contents. However, based on the function's intended behavior, we can infer that the function will return an integer representing the length of the sequence.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18; `sequence` is a list of integers representing the array to be found, with all elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9]; a value representing the size of the generated sequence has been returned.**
