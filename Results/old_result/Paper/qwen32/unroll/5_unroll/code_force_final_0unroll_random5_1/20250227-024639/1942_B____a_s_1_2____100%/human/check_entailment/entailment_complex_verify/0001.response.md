To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations in detail.

### Problem Description Recap
Farmer John gives Bessie an array `a` of length `n` constructed such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, where `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not appearing in the array. Bessie needs to construct the permutation `p` that satisfies this condition.

### Program Code
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

### Annotations and Original Assessment
The annotated code and the original assessment provide a detailed explanation of the program's logic, which appears to be correct based on the problem's requirements. The program initializes the permutation array `p` with -1 and sets the initial MEX value to `n`. It then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, calculates the corresponding `p[i]` using the formula `p[i] = MEX - a[i]`, and updates the MEX value to be the minimum of the current MEX and `p[i]`. Finally, it prints the permutation `p`.

### Detailed Reasoning
1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized with -1, indicating that no elements of `p` have been set yet.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the beginning since no elements are in `p`.

2. **Iterative Construction**:
   - The loop iterates from the last index to the first index of `a` (i.e., from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each `i`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
   - After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always reflects the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

3. **Validation**:
   - The program constructs `p` by working backwards from `a`, which is a valid approach given the problem's constraints.
   - The MEX value is correctly updated to ensure that the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the array `a` using the given approach. Since the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation `p` exists, the program will always produce a valid permutation.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
