Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description requires a Python script that generates specific files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subdirectories of the current directory, where the subdirectory names are within a specified numeric range. However, the given program is a completely different function that reads input values and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of '1's in a string. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.
