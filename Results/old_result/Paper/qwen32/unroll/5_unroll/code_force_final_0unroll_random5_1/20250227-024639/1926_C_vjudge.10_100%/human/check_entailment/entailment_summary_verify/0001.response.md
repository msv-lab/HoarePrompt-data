### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the provided code: the function `func_1()` is defined but never called. This means that the intended logic for solving the problem will not be executed when the script is run. Therefore, the program as provided is indeed incomplete and will not function as intended.

To summarize:
- The program correctly initializes a list `values` to store cumulative sums of digit sums.
- It accurately computes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\) and updates the cumulative sums in the `values` list.
- It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by printing the cumulative sum of digit sums up to the given `n` from the `values` list.

However, the lack of a call to `func_1()` means the program does not execute any of this logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect due to the missing function call. Therefore, the final evaluation should reflect this.

Final: **False**
