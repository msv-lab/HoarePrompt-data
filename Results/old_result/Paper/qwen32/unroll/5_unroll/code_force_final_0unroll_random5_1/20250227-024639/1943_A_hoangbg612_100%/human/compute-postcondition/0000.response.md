The code snippet `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was initially described as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4.

The values of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The only change is that `T` is now assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from input, representing the number of test cases; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a` where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
