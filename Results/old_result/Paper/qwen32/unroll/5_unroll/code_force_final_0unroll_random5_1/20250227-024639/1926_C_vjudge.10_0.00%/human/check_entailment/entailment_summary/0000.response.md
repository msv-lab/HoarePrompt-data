Reasoning:  
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description and the execution summary:

1. **Global `soma` Variable:** The `soma` variable is declared outside of the loop that processes each test case. This means that the sum of the digits from all test cases will be accumulated in the same variable, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

2. **Incorrect Loop Range:** The outer loop runs `N` times, where `N` is the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. However, the inner loop runs `n` times for each test case, where `n` is the integer read from the input for that test case. This inner loop should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) to process each number from 1 to `n`.

3. **Function Call Placement:** The function `func_1(i)` is called inside the inner loop, but the loop starts from 0, which is incorrect because the problem specifies that the numbers written on the board are from 1 to `n`.

4. **Output Requirement:** The problem requires that for each test case, the sum of the digits of the numbers from 1 to `n` is printed separately. The current program accumulates the results in a single variable and prints it only once after all test cases are processed.

To correct the program, the `soma` variable should be initialized inside the loop for each test case, the inner loop should start from 1, and the result for each test case should be printed individually.

Correctness: **False**
