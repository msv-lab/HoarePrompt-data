You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of lst is between 2 and 50 inclusive. This list represents the array a for a single test case. The function will be called multiple times, once for each test case, and the number of test cases t is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if `lst` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array of integers, and we can split any number that is at least 10 into its individual digits.
- The task is to determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-descending order by applying the above operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
- It then enters a loop where it checks if the array is already sorted using `func_1`.
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10.
- If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
- After attempting to sort the array, it checks again if the array is sorted and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop `for p in range(1, len(list1)):` only checks consecutive elements and performs the split operation based on that. This is not sufficient because the split operation can affect elements that are not immediate neighbors.
   - The loop should continue until the array is sorted or no more splits can be performed.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Splitting**:
   - The condition `if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:` checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10. However, it should check if any element is greater than 10 and can be split to potentially sort the array.

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Splitting Logic**:
   - The program only attempts to split the first element that violates the sorted order. It should attempt to split any element that is at least 10 and see if it helps in sorting the array.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if the list is sorted. However, it is used incorrectly within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. The program's logic is too simplistic and does not account for all possible ways to split elements and achieve a sorted array.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
