Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each screenshot description is a list of n distinct integers a_{ij} where 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, and a_{i0} (the first element of each list) is the author of the screenshot. All authors of the screenshots in a test case are different.**
