The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which is already defined in the initial state. The value of `T` will be used to control the number of iterations in a loop that will follow, but for now, only `T` is affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is the integer input representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that y = 0; The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
