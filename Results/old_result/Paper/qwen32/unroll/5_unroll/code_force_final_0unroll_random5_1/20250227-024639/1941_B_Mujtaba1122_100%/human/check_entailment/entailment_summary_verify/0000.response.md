### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the given program and the function summaries to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Rudolf can perform an operation on an array `a` of `n` integers by choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1`) and modifying the array as follows:
- `a[i - 1] = a[i - 1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i + 1] = a[i + 1] - 1`

The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation any number of times.

#### Program Analysis:

**Function 1 (`func_1`):**
- **Function Summary:** Checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- **Code:**
  ```python
  def func_1(list, n):
      for i in range(n):
          if list[i] != 0:
              return False
      return True
  ```
- **Evaluation:** This function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero. The function summary is accurate.

**Function 2 (`func_2`):**
- **Function Summary:** Modifies the list based on specific conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the list can be made zero.
- **Code:**
  ```python
  def func_2(list, n):
      for i in range(1, n - 1):
          while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
              list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
              list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
              list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
          if list[i - 1] != 0:
              print('no')
              return
      if func_1(list, n):
          print('YES')
      else:
          print('NO')
  ```
- **Evaluation:** 
  - The operation inside the `while` loop is incorrect. The operation should be:
    - `list[i + 1] -= 1`
    - `list[i] -= 2`
    - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
    - The current code incorrectly multiplies `list[i - 1]` by itself, which is not the intended operation.
  - The check `if list[i - 1] != 0` after the `while` loop is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero. It only checks if the current element at `i - 1` is zero, which is not enough.
  - The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' directly, which is not ideal for further processing or testing.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program:
1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`:** The operation inside the `while` loop is incorrect.
2. **Incorrect Check in `func_2`:** The check `if list[i - 1] != 0` is insufficient.
3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:** The code does not handle cases where the array cannot be made zero due to the constraints of the operations.
4. **Output Handling:** The function prints "YES" or "NO" directly, which is not suitable for further processing or testing.

#### Corrected Program:
The corrected version provided in the original assessment checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and then simulates the operations to ensure all elements can be made zero. This approach is more accurate and handles the edge cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned in the original assessment.

**Final: False**
