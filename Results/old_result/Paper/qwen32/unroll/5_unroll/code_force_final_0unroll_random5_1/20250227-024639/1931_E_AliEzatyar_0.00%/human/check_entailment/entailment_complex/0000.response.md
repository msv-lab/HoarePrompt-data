### Reasoning:

Let's carefully examine the provided code and the logic behind it.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`n`), the parameter `m`, and the list of integers (`array`).

2. **Counting Digits and Trailing Zeros:**
   - It initializes `total_digits` to count the total number of digits in the list.
   - It initializes `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros in each number.
   - For each number in the list, it calculates the total number of digits and counts the trailing zeros using the function `func_1`.

3. **Sorting and Summing Trailing Zeros:**
   - It sorts the list of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It sums every other element in the sorted `zeros` list (starting from the first element) into `subtract_zero`.

4. **Win Condition Check:**
   - It checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If true, it assigns 'Sasha' to the answers list.
   - Otherwise, it assigns 'Anna'.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a string representation of a number and counts the number of trailing zeros.
   - It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, counting zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

### Issues Identified:

- **Incorrect Winner Assignment:**
  - The code assigns 'Sashah' instead of 'Sasha' in the win condition check. This is a typo and should be corrected to 'Sasha'.

- **Incorrect Logic for Trailing Zeros:**
  - The function `func_1` is correctly counting trailing zeros, but the logic for determining the winner seems flawed.
  - The key point is that Sasha wins if the final number is at least `10^m`. The provided logic does not correctly simulate the game's rules, especially how Sasha and Anna make optimal moves.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, particularly the typo and the incorrect logic for determining the winner, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
