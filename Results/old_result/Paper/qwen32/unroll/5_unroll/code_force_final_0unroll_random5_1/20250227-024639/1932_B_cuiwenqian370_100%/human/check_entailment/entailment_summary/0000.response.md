Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `last_year` with the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the `next_year` using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula ensures that the next sign occurs at the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly after `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues the process for all signs.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.

The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement. It calculates the year for each test case based on the sequential occurrence of signs and outputs the correct results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
