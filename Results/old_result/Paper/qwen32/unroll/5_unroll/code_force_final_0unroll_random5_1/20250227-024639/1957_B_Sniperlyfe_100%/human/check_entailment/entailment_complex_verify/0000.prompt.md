You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first few elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and the rest are zeros; `k` is 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of `n` integers where the first element is `min(nums[0], 0)` and the rest are zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of integers in the list and `k` is an integer. It returns a list `nums` of `n` integers where the first element is the maximum value that can be represented with the number of bits equal to the bit length of `k`, minus one, plus any remaining `k` after distributing values to subsequent elements, and the rest of the elements are as large as possible up to that value or zero if `k` is exhausted.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Recap
We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
1. The sum of the sequence is `k`.
2. The number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence is maximized.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Setting the first element of the sequence to the largest possible value that can be represented with the same number of bits as `k` (specifically, `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`).
2. Distributing the remaining sum (`k - nums[0]`) among the remaining elements, ensuring each element is at most `nums[0] + 1`.
3. Adjusting the first element to account for any leftover sum after distribution.

### Potential Issues
Let's consider a few potential cases to see if the program meets the requirements.

#### Case 1: Simple Case
**Input:**
```
1
1 5
```
**Expected Output:**
```
5
```
**Program Output:**
```
5
```
This case works as expected.

#### Case 2: Smaller `n` and `k`
**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
```
**Program Output:**
```
3 0
```
The program outputs `3 0`, which sums to `3` but does not maximize the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. The bitwise OR of `3` and `0` is `3` (binary `11`), which has `2` `1`s. However, the output `1 2` (binary `01` and `10`) has `3` `1`s in its bitwise OR (`11`).

#### Case 3: Larger `n` and `k`
**Input:**
```
1
6 51
```
**Expected Output:**
```
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
**Program Output:**
```
31 1 1 1 1 1
```
The program outputs `31 1 1 1 1 1`, which sums to `51` but does not maximize the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. The bitwise OR of `31` and `1` is `31` (binary `11111`), which has `5` `1`s. However, the output `3 1 1 32 2 12` (binary `00011`, `00001`, `00001`, `100000`, `00010`, `01100`) has `6` `1`s in its bitwise OR (`111111`).

### Conclusion
The program does not always maximize the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR for certain inputs, as demonstrated by the examples above.
