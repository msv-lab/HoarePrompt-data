You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains three parts: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a list a of length n with integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n with integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. The first element of the sorted list is the number of test cases `t`, and the subsequent elements are the test cases themselves, each represented as a list containing an integer `n`, a list `a` of length `n`, and a list `b` of length `n`, all sorted in descending order based on their natural lexicographical order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to make sure that each problem's difficulty in array `a` is less than or equal to the corresponding problem's expected difficulty in array `b`. The allowed operation is to insert a new problem with difficulty `w` into array `a`, sort the array, and then remove the most difficult problem (the last element in the sorted array).

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of problems, and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to 0. `i` will traverse list `a`, and `j` will traverse list `b`.
   - A counter `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of new problems added.

3. **While Loop:**
   - The loop runs while both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
   - If the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`, it means we need to replace `a[i]` with a new problem of difficulty `b[j]` to make `a[i] <= b[j]`.
     - The program removes the last element of `a` (the most difficult problem) and inserts `b[j]` at position `i`. This operation is incorrect because it does not sort the array `a` after the insertion, and it does not guarantee that `b[j]` is the best choice to insert.
     - The counter `cnt` is incremented by 1.
     - `j` is incremented by 1, moving to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, both `i` and `j` are incremented, moving to the next pair of actual and expected difficulties.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the value of `cnt`, which represents the number of new problems added.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The core issue with the program is the incorrect handling of the insertion and sorting of new problems. The program does not sort `a` after inserting a new problem, and it does not ensure that the inserted problem is the best choice to minimize the number of new problems.
- The correct approach would involve a different strategy, such as using a priority queue or a binary search to find the appropriate position for new problems, ensuring that the array `a` remains sorted and that the minimum number of new problems is added.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
