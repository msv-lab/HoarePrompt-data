Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the handling of the "12 AM" and "12 PM" cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly assigns "12 AM" to "00:00" instead of "12:00", and it assigns "12 PM" to "12:00" instead of "00:00". The correct mapping should be:

- "00:00" should be "12:00 AM"
- "12:00" should be "12:00 PM"

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h1 = h
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h - 12
            time = 'PM'
        print(f"{h1:02}:{m:02} {time}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format, including the special cases for "12 AM" and "12 PM".
