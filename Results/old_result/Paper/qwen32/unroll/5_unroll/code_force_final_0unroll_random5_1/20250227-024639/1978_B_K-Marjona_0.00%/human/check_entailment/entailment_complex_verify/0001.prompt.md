You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each representing the total cost of selling n buns given the usual price a and the modified price b for the first k buns, where k is the minimum of n and the difference between b and a. If b is less than or equal to a, the total cost is simply n multiplied by a. Otherwise, the total cost is calculated as the sum of the arithmetic series for the first k buns at the modified price plus the cost of the remaining (n-k) buns at the usual price.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates and returns the total cost of buying `n` buns, where the first bun is sold at the modified price `b`, and the remaining `n-1` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable approach because `k` cannot exceed the number of buns `n`, and it also cannot exceed `b - a` (the number of times the price can decrease before it becomes less than or equal to the usual price `a`).

3. **Calculate Maximum Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly prints `a * n` because there's no benefit to selling any buns at a reduced price.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit as follows:
     - The sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at reduced prices is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
       \[
       \text{Sum} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2}
       \]
     - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the total profit.
     - The total profit is then printed as the sum of these two parts.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the examples:

- **Input:** `4 4 5`
- **Calculation:**
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = min(4, 1) = 1`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Sum of the first `k` buns: \((5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) \times 1 / 2 = 5\)
    - Remaining buns: `(4 - 1) * 4 = 12`
    - Total profit: `5 + 12 = 17`
- **Output:** `17` (matches the expected output)

The program correctly handles this case and similar cases as per the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the maximum profit according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
