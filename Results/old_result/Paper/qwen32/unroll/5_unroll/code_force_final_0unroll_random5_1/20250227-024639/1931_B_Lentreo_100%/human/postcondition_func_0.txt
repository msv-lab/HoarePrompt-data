The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `nums`, where each inner list contains integers representing the amounts of water in containers for different test cases. It checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in each test case such that all containers have the same amount of water. If redistribution is possible for all test cases, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
