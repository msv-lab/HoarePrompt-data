The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Similarly, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: `good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` matching elements with `b` based on frequency. If the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. `window_freq` reflects the frequency of elements in the last `m` elements of `a`, and `matches` reflects the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements in the last `m` elements of `a` that also appear in `b`.

    #The program returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` matching elements with `b` based on frequency.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function counts and returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in the list `a` that have at least `k` elements in common with the list `b` based on frequency.
