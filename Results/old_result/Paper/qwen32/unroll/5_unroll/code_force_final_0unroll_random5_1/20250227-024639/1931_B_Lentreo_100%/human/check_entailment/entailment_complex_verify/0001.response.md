Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` containers with water, each containing `a_i` units of water.
- The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
- The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Key Observations:
1. **Equal Distribution Requirement**:
   - For the containers to have the same amount of water, each container should have `mean = total_sum / n` units of water.
   
2. **Operation Constraint**:
   - Water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Calculate the Mean**:
   - The mean amount of water each container should have is `total_sum / n`.

2. **Check Balance**:
   - It then iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running total (`curr`) of the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point the running total `curr` becomes negative, it returns "NO". This suggests that the program is checking if it's possible to balance the water without ever needing to pour water "backwards" (i.e., from a higher index to a lower index).

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Positive Running Total (`curr`)**:
  - The program ensures that the running total `curr` never goes negative. This means that by the time we reach any container `j`, we should have enough water in the previously considered containers (from `1` to `j-1`) to balance the water up to container `j`.
  
- **Final Check**:
  - If the running total `curr` is never negative, it means we can pour water from lower-indexed containers to higher-indexed containers in such a way that all containers end up with the mean amount of water.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all containers already have the mean amount of water, the program will return "YES".
  - If the sum of water in the first `k` containers is less than `k * mean` at any point, the program will return "NO", which is correct because it means we can't balance the water without violating the operation constraint.

### Annotations Analysis:
The annotations provided are mostly consistent with the code, but there is a critical misunderstanding in the state description of the `func_1` function. Specifically:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - The annotation states that `nums` is a list of lists, which is incorrect. `nums` is a single list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers for a single test case.
  
- **State Inside Function**:
  - The annotation correctly identifies that `n` is the length of `nums` and `total` is the sum of all integers in `nums`.
  - The annotation correctly states that `mean` is `total // n`.
  - The annotation correctly describes the logic of the loop and the condition for returning "NO".

### Conclusion:
The logic of the program is correct based on the problem constraints and the annotations. The program correctly checks if it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount of water without violating the operation constraint.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
