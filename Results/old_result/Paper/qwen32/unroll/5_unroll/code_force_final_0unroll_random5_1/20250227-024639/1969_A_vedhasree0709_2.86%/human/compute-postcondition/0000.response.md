The loop head in the provided code snippet is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized or adjusted in the state. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`, as it determines the number of iterations of the loop.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 5000`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

The state provided already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Thus, the state remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
