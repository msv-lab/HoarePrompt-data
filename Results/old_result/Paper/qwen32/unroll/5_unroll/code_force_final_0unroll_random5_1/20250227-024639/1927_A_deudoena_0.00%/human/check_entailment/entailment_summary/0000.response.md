### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white in order for the entire strip to become white. The provided program finds the index of the first 'B' (ind1) and the index of the last 'B' (ind2) in the string. It then calculates the length of the segment that spans from the first 'B' to the last 'B' by using the formula `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

This approach is logically sound because:
- The first 'B' marks the start of the segment that needs to be painted.
- The last 'B' marks the end of the segment that needs to be painted.
- The length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B' is calculated correctly by subtracting the index of the last 'B' (from the end of the string) and the index of the first 'B' from the total length of the string.

However, there is a mistake in the code. The variable `ind2` is calculated as the distance from the end of the string to the last 'B', not the actual index of the last 'B'. Therefore, the correct formula to calculate the length of the segment should be `ind2 + ind1 + 1` instead of `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = len(inpstr) - i - 1
            break
    print(ind2 - ind1 + 1)
```

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. It needs to be corrected as shown above.
