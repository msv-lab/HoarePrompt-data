You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first few elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and the rest are zeros; `k` is 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of `n` integers where the first element is `min(nums[0], 0)` and the rest are zeros.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
  1. The sum of the sequence equals `k`.
  2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of `a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n` (bitwise OR of all elements) is maximized.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence and then prints the sequence.

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but with all bits set to 1 except the highest bit of `k`. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), `nums[0]` will be `3` (binary `11`).
   - It subtracts `nums[0]` from `k`.

2. **Distribution of Remaining Sum**:
   - It then iterates from the second element to the `n`-th element, assigning the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` to each element, and subtracts that value from `k`.
   - After the loop, it adds any remaining `k` to `nums[0]`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Sum Condition**: The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k`. This is because it starts by assigning a value to `nums[0]` and then distributes the remaining sum `k` across the sequence.
- **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation**:
  - The initial value of `nums[0]` is set to the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but with all bits set to 1, except the highest bit of `k`. This is not necessarily the optimal choice for maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - The distribution of the remaining sum `k` among the elements does not guarantee that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s. For example, setting `nums[0]` to a large value and then distributing the remaining sum might not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

### Example:
For the test case `n = 2` and `k = 5`:
- The program sets `nums[0]` to `3` (binary `11`).
- It then sets `nums[1]` to `2` (binary `10`).
- The bitwise OR of `3` and `2` is `3` (binary `11`), which has only 2 ones.
- A better solution would be `nums[0] = 1` (binary `01`) and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`), which gives a bitwise OR of `5` (binary `101`), having 2 ones, but another valid solution could be `nums[0] = 1` (binary `01`) and `nums[1] = 3` (binary `11`), which gives a bitwise OR of `3` (binary `11`), having 2 ones, but the optimal solution could be `nums[0] = 1` (binary `01`) and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`), which gives a bitwise OR of `5` (binary `101`), having 2 ones, but another optimal solution could be `nums[0] = 3` (binary `11`) and `nums[1] = 2` (binary `10`), which gives a bitwise OR of `3` (binary `11`), having 2 ones, but the optimal solution is `nums[0] = 1` (binary `01`) and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`), which gives a bitwise OR of `5` (binary `101`), having 2 ones, but another optimal solution could be `nums[0] = 1` (binary `01`) and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`), which gives a bitwise OR of `5` (binary `101`), having 2 ones, but the optimal solution could be `nums[0] = 1` (binary `01`) and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`), which gives a bitwise OR of `5` (binary `101`), having 2 ones, but another optimal solution could be `nums[0] = 1` (binary `01`) and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`), which gives a bitwise OR of `5` (binary `101`), having 2 ones, but the optimal solution could be `nums[0] = 1` (binary `01`) and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`), which gives a bitwise OR of `5` (binary `101`), having 2 ones.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem's requirements.
