Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine if it's possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The condition `if n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if the tower can have exactly `m` cubes. 

Nikita can increase the number of cubes by 1 or decrease it by 1 in each move. Therefore, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of such changes is required to go from 0 to `m` if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

Here is the corrected logic:
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, then it's possible to end up with `m` cubes.
- Otherwise, it's not possible.

The corrected program would look something like this:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
