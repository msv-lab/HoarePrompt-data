Let's analyze the given program to ensure it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Sasha wants to maximize the "beauty" of an array by rearranging its elements.
- The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**: This function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array. Sorting the array in ascending or descending order will maximize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The absolute differences will be maximized when the largest and smallest elements are adjacent in the sorted array, which is achieved by sorting.

2. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty is calculated by iterating through the sorted array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Since the array is sorted, the absolute difference between consecutive elements is simply the difference, as the larger element will always come after the smaller one.

3. **Handling Input and Output**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the length of the array and the array elements, then calls `func_1` to compute the beauty and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **All Elements Identical**: In the second example, all elements are 69. The beauty is correctly calculated as 0.
- **Two Elements**: In the last example, the array is [2, 1]. The beauty is correctly calculated as 1.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The function handles multiple test cases by iterating through the input data and processing each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles multiple test cases and input/output operations.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program sorts the array to maximize the beauty and correctly calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also handles multiple test cases and input/output operations as required by the problem description.
