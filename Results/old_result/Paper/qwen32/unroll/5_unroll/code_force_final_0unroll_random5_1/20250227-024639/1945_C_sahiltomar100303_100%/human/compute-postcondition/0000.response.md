The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state includes the variable `n` (number of houses) and the string `a` (preferences of residents), but these are not affected by the current code snippet. The only variable that changes is `t`, which is assigned the value of the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, where `a_j = 0` if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and `a_j = 1` if the resident wants to live on the right side.**
