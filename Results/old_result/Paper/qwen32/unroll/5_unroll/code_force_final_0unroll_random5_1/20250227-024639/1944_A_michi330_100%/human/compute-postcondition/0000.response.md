Output State: **`t` is an input integer, Each test case contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. The function is called multiple times for t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, representing the number of test cases. The conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are part of the problem description and not affected by the input of `t`.
