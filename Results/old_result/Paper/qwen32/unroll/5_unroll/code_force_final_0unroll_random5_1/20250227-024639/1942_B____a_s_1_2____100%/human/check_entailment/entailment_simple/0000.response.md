### Reasoning:

The given problem involves constructing a permutation `p` based on a given array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The task is to reverse-engineer the permutation `p` from the given array `a`.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array `a` in reverse order and calculating the permutation `p` as follows:
1. Initialize `mex` to `n`, which represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in `p`.
2. For each index `i` from `n-1` down to `0`, compute `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
3. Update `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` to ensure `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet in `p`.

The logic behind this approach is as follows:
- Since `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, rearranging gives `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
- By iterating from the end to the beginning, we can determine `p_i` based on the `mex` of the already determined elements of `p` (which are initially none).

However, there is a flaw in the program's logic. The `mex` should be recalculated correctly by ensuring that it is the smallest non-negative integer not included in the current permutation `p` up to the current index.

Let's correct the approach:
- Instead of initializing `mex` to `n` and updating it to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and find the smallest non-negative integer not in this set.
- This can be efficiently done using a set and incrementing a counter to find the next `mex`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
        
        print(*p)

#State: `p` is the permutation constructed for the last test case, and `mex` is the minimum excluded value from the last test case.
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the `mex` value. The corrected version ensures that `mex` is recalculated correctly by maintaining a set of used numbers.

**Correctness: False**

However, if the intention was to provide a different correct approach, the provided program would not work as intended. The corrected version above should be used for accurate results.
