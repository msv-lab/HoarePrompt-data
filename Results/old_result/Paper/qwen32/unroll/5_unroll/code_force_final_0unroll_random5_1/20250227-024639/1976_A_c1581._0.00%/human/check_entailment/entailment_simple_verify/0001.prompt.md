You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter (i.e., after each letter, there is either another letter or the end of the string).
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element is the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, the program reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password string itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each password, it calls the function `func_1(password)` to check if the password is strong.

3. **Function `func_1(password)`:**
   - **Separating Digits and Letters:**
     - It initializes two empty lists: `digits` and `letters`.
     - It iterates over each character in the password:
       - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
       - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - **Checking Order of Digits and Letters:**
     - It initializes `last_digit_index` to `-1`.
     - It iterates over each character in the password with its index:
       - If the character is a digit, it updates `last_digit_index` to the current index.
       - If the character is a letter and `last_digit_index` is not `-1` (indicating a digit has been seen before), it returns 'NO' because a letter follows a digit.
   - **Checking Sorted Order:**
     - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - If both conditions are met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

### Verification:
- The program correctly separates digits and letters and checks if any letter follows a digit.
- It also correctly checks if both the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong according to the problem's requirements.
