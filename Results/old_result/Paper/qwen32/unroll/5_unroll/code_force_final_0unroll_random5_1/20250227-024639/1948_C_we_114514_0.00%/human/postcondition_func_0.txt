The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` of tuples. Each tuple contains an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>'. It returns a list of strings, each being either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the second string in each tuple is reachable from the first string based on specific movement rules for each test case.
