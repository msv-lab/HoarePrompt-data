You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of coins needed to travel between pairs of cities. The cities are located on a number line, and we have two types of travel options:
1. Travel to the closest city for 1 coin.
2. Travel directly to any other city for the distance in coins.

Given that the closest city for each city is unique, we need to calculate the cost for each query efficiently.

### Program Analysis

The program seems to be attempting to precompute some values to speed up the query processing. Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `d1` and `d2` are dictionaries used to store precomputed values.
   - `lst` is the list of city positions.

2. **First Loop (Forward Calculation)**:
   - This loop iterates from the first city to the last city.
   - It calculates the cost of reaching each city from the previous city, either by moving to the closest city or directly.
   - The cost is stored in `d1`.

3. **Second Loop (Backward Calculation)**:
   - This loop iterates from the last city to the first city.
   - It performs a similar calculation as the first loop but in the opposite direction.
   - The cost is stored in `d2`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the cost of traveling from the start city to the end city using the precomputed values in `d1` and `d2`.
   - It prints the minimum cost between the two possible paths.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program's cost calculation logic is flawed. It does not correctly determine the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities.
   - The logic for updating `s` (the cost) is incorrect. It does not properly account for the cost of moving to the closest city versus moving directly.

2. **Incorrect Use of Dictionaries**:
   - The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are not being used correctly. They should store the minimum cost to reach each city from the start and end, respectively, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

3. **Logic for Closest City**:
   - The program does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. It incorrectly assumes that the closest city is always the next or previous city in the list, which is not necessarily true.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the program's logic and cost calculation, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The program's approach to precompute costs and use them for queries is flawed, and it does not correctly identify the closest city for each city.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
