To determine the output state, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `sub_summ`. The loop iterates over each tuple in `main_ar`. For each tuple `val_b`, if the sum of its two elements is greater than or equal to 0, it adds this sum to `sub_summ`.

Given the initial state, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. The loop does not modify `main_ar` or `sec_arr` directly; it only modifies `sub_summ`.

Let's assume the initial state of `main_ar` and `sec_arr` is as follows:
- `main_ar = [(1, 2), (-3, 4), (0, 0), (5, -6)]`
- `sec_arr = [(10, 20), (30, 40), (50, 60)]`
- `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of `sec_arr`, which is `10 + 30 + 50 = 90`.

Now, let's go through each iteration of the loop:
- For `val_b = (1, 2)`, `1 + 2 = 3` which is `>= 0`, so `sub_summ` becomes `90 + 3 = 93`.
- For `val_b = (-3, 4)`, `-3 + 4 = 1` which is `>= 0`, so `sub_summ` becomes `93 + 1 = 94`.
- For `val_b = (0, 0)`, `0 + 0 = 0` which is `>= 0`, so `sub_summ` becomes `94 + 0 = 94`.
- For `val_b = (5, -6)`, `5 - 6 = -1` which is `< 0`, so `sub_summ` remains `94`.

Thus, after all iterations, `sub_summ` is `94`.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers; `sub_summ` is 94.**
