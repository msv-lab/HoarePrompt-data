### Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine if a robot can reach the cell (2, n) starting from (1, 1) in a 2-row grid, given the movement constraints defined by arrows in each cell. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. Here are the key issues:

1. **Initial Movement Constraints**: The robot can move left, right, down, or up, but the current implementation does not consider the robot's ability to move up or down in the first move. The robot can move down to the second row on the first move, which is not accounted for in the logic.

2. **Incorrect Reachability Logic**: The program only considers the possibility of moving right and does not account for the possibility of moving left or up. For example, if the robot moves down from (1, 1) to (2, 1), it can then move according to the arrows in the second row. The current logic does not handle this scenario correctly.

3. **Inconsistent Reachability Updates**: The logic for updating `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` is inconsistent and does not properly reflect the robot's movement possibilities.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
