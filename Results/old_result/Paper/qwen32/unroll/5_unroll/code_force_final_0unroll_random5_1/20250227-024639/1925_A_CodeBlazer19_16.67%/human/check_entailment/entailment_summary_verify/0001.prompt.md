You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a string `s` of length `k` using the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. Otherwise, it prints the string `s` repeated either once or twice, depending on whether `n` is 1 or greater than 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in `s`. The string `s` should be of the smallest possible length. If there are multiple valid strings of the same length, any one of them can be printed.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. It then constructs a string `s` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an empty string `s`.
2. **String Construction**: It constructs a string `s` by appending the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For example, if `k=3`, `s` will be `"abc"`.
3. **Output**:
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `n` repetitions of `s`. For example, if `n=3` and `k=1`, it prints `"aaa"`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the string `s` twice if `n > 1`, or just `s` if `n == 1`. For example, if `n=2` and `k=2`, it prints `"abab"`.

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's evaluate the correctness of the program using the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case (n=1, k=2)**:
   - The program constructs `s` as `"ab"`.
   - It prints `"ab"`.
   - This is correct because both `"a"` and `"b"` are subsequences of `"ab"`.

2. **Second Test Case (n=2, k=1)**:
   - The program constructs `s` as `"a"`.
   - It prints `"aa"`.
   - This is correct because `"aa"` is the only possible string of length 2 using `"a"`.

3. **Third Test Case (n=2, k=2)**:
   - The program constructs `s` as `"ab"`.
   - It prints `"abab"`.
   - This is correct because `"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, and `"bb"` are subsequences of `"abab"`.

4. **Fourth Test Case (n=2, k=3)**:
   - The program constructs `s` as `"abc"`.
   - It prints `"abcabc"`.
   - This is incorrect because not all possible strings of length 2 using `"abc"` (e.g., `"ac"`, `"ba"`, `"ca"`, `"bc"`, `"cb"`, `"cc"`) are subsequences of `"abcabc"`. For example, `"ac"` is not a subsequence of `"abcabc"`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly generate the required string `s` for all cases. Specifically, it fails to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s` when `n > 1` and `k > 1`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
