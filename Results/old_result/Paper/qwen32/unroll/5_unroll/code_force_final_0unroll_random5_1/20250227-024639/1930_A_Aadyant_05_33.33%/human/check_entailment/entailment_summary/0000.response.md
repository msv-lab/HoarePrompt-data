### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and then reads a list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This is a key step in achieving the optimal solution because, to maximize the score, we want to pair the smallest numbers together.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program calculates the score by summing up every second element from the sorted list. This strategy ensures that we are always adding the smaller of each pair to the score, which is the optimal way to maximize the score based on the problem description.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the calculated score for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy of sorting the list and summing every second element to achieve the maximum score. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
