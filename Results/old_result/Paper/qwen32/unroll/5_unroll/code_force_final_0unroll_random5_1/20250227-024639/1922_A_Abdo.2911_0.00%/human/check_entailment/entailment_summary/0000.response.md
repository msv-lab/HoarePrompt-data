### Reasoning:

The given program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs the template `t` by iterating over each character of strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the lowercase version of that character to the template.
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`, since they are different) to the template.

2. **Matching Check**:
   - The program then checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
     - For positions where the template has a lowercase letter, both `a` and `b` must have the same lowercase letter.
     - For positions where the template has an uppercase letter, both `a` and `b` must have a different lowercase letter.
   - The program also checks if `c` does not match the template.
     - For positions where the template has a lowercase letter, `c` must have the same lowercase letter.
     - For positions where the template has an uppercase letter, `c` must have a different lowercase letter.

3. **Output Decision**:
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program outputs "YES".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.
