### Reasoning:

The program's logic relies on a binary representation approach to determine the k-th card in the sequence. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct based on the problem description:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - `m` is initialized to 1. This variable represents the multiplier for the sequence (starting from 1, then 2, then 4, etc.).

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This gives the number of odd-numbered cards (or cards that are multiples of the current multiplier) that can be laid down in the current step.
   - `n` is updated to `n // 2`, effectively reducing the problem size by half for the next iteration.
   - If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the loop breaks. This condition checks if the k-th card lies within the current sequence of cards being considered.
   - If the condition is not met, `s` is incremented by `x` (the number of cards considered in this step) and `m` is doubled (to consider the next multiplier).

3. **Output**:
   - Once the loop breaks, the k-th card is determined by the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`. This formula calculates the specific card based on its position within the current sequence and the current multiplier.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input**: `n = 7`, `k = 1`
  - `s = 0`, `m = 1`
  - `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`
  - `n = 7 // 2 = 3`
  - `s < k <= s + x` is `0 < 1 <= 4`, so the loop breaks.
  - The k-th card is `(2 * (1 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 1`.

- **Input**: `n = 7`, `k = 5`
  - `s = 0`, `m = 1`
  - `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`
  - `n = 7 // 2 = 3`
  - `s < k <= s + x` is not met, so `s = 4` and `m = 2`.
  - `x = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `n = 3 // 2 = 1`
  - `s < k <= s + x` is `4 < 5 <= 6`, so the loop breaks.
  - The k-th card is `(2 * (5 - 4) - 1) * 2 = 2`.

The program correctly outputs `1` for `k = 1` and `2` for `k = 5`, matching the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card in the sequence as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
