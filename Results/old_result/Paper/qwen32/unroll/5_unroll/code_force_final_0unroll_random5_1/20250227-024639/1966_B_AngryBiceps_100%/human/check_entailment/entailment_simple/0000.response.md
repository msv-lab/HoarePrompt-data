### Reasoning:

The program attempts to determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The logic is based on checking the first and last rows and the first and last columns of the grid. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **First and Last Rows Check**:
   - The program checks if the first and last rows of the grid contain only one unique color each (`len(set(a[0])) == 1` and `len(set(a[-1])) == 1`).
   - It also checks if these two rows are different (`a[0] != a[-1]`).
   - If both conditions are true, it means the first row and the last row are monochromatic but different, implying that it is impossible to make the entire grid monochromatic with the given operations. Hence, it prints "NO".

2. **First and Last Columns Check**:
   - Similarly, the program checks if the first and last columns of the grid contain only one unique color each (`len(set(first_row)) == 1` and `len(set(last_row)) == 1`).
   - It also checks if these two columns are different (`first_row != last_row`).
   - If both conditions are true, it means the first column and the last column are monochromatic but different, implying that it is impossible to make the entire grid monochromatic with the given operations. Hence, it prints "NO".

3. **Default Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to make the entire grid monochromatic with the given operations.

### Correctness:

The logic provided in the program is correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

- **Monochromatic Rows or Columns**:
  - If the first and last rows or columns are monochromatic and different, it is impossible to make the entire grid monochromatic because there is no way to connect these two different monochromatic regions using the given operations.

- **Other Cases**:
  - If the first and last rows or columns are not both monochromatic and different, then it is always possible to make the entire grid monochromatic. This is because you can always select pairs of squares within the same row or column to expand the monochromatic regions until the entire grid is covered.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify with one of the examples from the problem statement:

- **Input**:
  ```
  2 2
  BB
  BB
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  YES
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - The first and last rows are both monochromatic and the same (`BB`).
  - The first and last columns are both monochromatic and the same (`BB`).
  - Since neither condition for "NO" is met, the program correctly outputs "YES".

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations.

**Correctness: True**
