Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to generate an array of integers such that the array has exactly X increasing subsequences. The core logic is implemented in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to modify the `sequence` list by appending integers based on the calculations involving `number` (which is actually `X - 1` in the main loop).

However, the execution summary indicates a critical issue: the function `func_1` always returns the tuple `(0, 0)` regardless of the input values. This return statement is not utilized in the program, but the primary concern is that the function does not correctly append the necessary integers to the `sequence` list to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences. The function's logic is flawed, and it does not seem to be correctly implementing the algorithm to generate the required array.

Given the provided output examples and the problem's requirements, the program is not generating the correct arrays for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
