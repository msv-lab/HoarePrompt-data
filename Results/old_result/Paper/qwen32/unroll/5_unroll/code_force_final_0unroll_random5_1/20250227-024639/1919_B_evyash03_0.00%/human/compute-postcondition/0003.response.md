To determine the final state after the loop executes, we need to evaluate the changes to the `balance` and `count` variables based on the input string `expression`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `balance` starts at 0.
   - `count` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character in `expression`:
     - If the character is '+', `balance` is incremented by 1.
     - If the character is '-', `balance` is decremented by 1.
     - If after the above operation, `balance` becomes less than 0, `count` is incremented by 1 and `balance` is reset to 0.

3. **Final State**:
   - `balance` will be the net result of all '+' and '-' operations, but it will never be negative because whenever it becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
   - `count` will be the number of times `balance` was reset to 0 because it went negative.

Given these points, the final `balance` will be the total number of '+' characters minus the total number of '-' characters, but only up to the point where it never goes negative during the process. The `count` will be the number of times the `balance` had to be reset to 0.

Output State: **expression is a string of length length consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, count is the number of times balance went negative and was reset to 0, balance is the final non-negative value after all operations.**
