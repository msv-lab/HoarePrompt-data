Reasoning:  
The given Python program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over each element in the array (except the last two) and applying the described operation to make all elements zero. However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. The program incorrectly uses `b[i] -= b[i]` which will always set `b[i]` to zero in the first iteration of the loop, effectively nullifying the intended operation.
2. The operation described in the problem is not correctly applied. The program is supposed to reduce `b[i-1]`, `b[i]`, and `b[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but this is not what the code does.
3. The loop starts from index 0, which is not valid according to the problem statement (operations can only be applied starting from index 2).
4. The program checks if the last two elements are zero after the loop, but does not account for the fact that the operations should be able to reduce all elements to zero, not just the last two.
5. The program does not handle the case where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros due to the initial values or the constraints of the operations.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
