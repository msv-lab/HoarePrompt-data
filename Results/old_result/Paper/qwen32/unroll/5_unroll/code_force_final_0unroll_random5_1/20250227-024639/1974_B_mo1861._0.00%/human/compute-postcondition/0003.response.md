To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down what the loop does step by step:

1. **`sorted(set(b))`**: This part of the code first creates a set from the string `b` to remove any duplicate characters, and then sorts the unique characters in ascending order (lexicographically).

2. **`enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`**: This enumerates over the sorted unique characters, providing both the index `i` and the character `c`.

3. **`char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`**: For each character `c`, a new mapping is created in the `char_map` dictionary. The key is the character `c`, and the value is a new character determined by the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. This formula shifts the character `c` to a new character starting from 'a' up to 'z', where the most frequent or earliest lexicographical character in `b` gets mapped to the last letter of the alphabet, and so on.

Given the above steps, the loop effectively maps each unique character in the string `b` to a character in the alphabet in reverse order of their sorted appearance.

### Output State Description:
- `b`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `char_map`: Is a dictionary where each unique character from `b` is mapped to a character from 'a' to 'z' in reverse order of their sorted appearance in `b`.

### Example:
If `b = "abracadabra"`, the unique characters in sorted order are `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'r']`. The loop will map:
- 'a' to 'e' (since `len(b) - 0 - 1 = 10 - 0 - 1 = 9` which is 'j' but since we start from 'a', it's the 10th character back from 'a' which is 'j' but 'e' in 0-based indexing)
- 'b' to 'd'
- 'c' to 'c'
- 'd' to 'b'
- 'r' to 'a'

Thus, the `char_map` will be `{'a': 'e', 'b': 'd', 'c': 'c', 'd': 'b', 'r': 'a'}`.

Output State: **`b` is unchanged, and `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `b` to a character from 'a' to 'z' in reverse order of their sorted appearance in `b`.**
