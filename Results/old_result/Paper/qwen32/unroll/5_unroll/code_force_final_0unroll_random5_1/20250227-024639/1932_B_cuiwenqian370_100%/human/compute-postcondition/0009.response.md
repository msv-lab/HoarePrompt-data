Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no arguments. It reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function calculates and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities for each test case.**
