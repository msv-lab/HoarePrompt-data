Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function and the subsequent decision-making process in the main loop. The `func_1` function is supposed to compute the frequency of each card number but incorrectly caps the frequency at `k` for each card. This capping does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations.

The main logic should involve calculating the remainder of the frequency of each card number when divided by `k - 1`. This is because for every `k` cards of the same number, we can reduce the count by `k - 1` cards. The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of these remainders, with the constraint that if the sum is zero, we should return 1 (since no operations can reduce the count to zero).

Here's a correct approach:
- For each unique card number, compute the frequency.
- For each frequency, compute the remainder when divided by `k - 1`.
- Sum these remainders.
- If the sum is zero, return 1; otherwise, return the sum.

Given the incorrect logic in the provided program, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
