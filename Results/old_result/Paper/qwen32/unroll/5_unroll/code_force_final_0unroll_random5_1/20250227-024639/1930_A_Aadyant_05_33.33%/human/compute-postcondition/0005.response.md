To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the loop's behavior:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `out` is a list containing `int(num)` sums, where each sum is the sum of every second element from the sorted list of integers provided for each iteration.
   - Variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for outputs in out:
       print(outputs)
   ```
   - This loop iterates over each element in the `out` list and prints it.

3. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - The loop will print each element of the `out` list.
   - The state of the `out` list itself does not change; it only gets printed.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since the loop only prints the elements of `out` and does not modify `out` or any other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`), the state of `out` remains the same after the loop execution.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state with respect to the `out` list.

Output State: **`out` is a list containing `int(num)` sums, where each sum is the sum of every second element from the sorted list of integers provided for each iteration. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`) remain unchanged.**
