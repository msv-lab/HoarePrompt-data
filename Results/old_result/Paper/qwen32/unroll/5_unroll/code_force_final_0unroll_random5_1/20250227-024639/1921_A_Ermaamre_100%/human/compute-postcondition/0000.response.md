Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The precondition about the range of `t` and the properties of the coordinates of the corners of the square remain unchanged. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
