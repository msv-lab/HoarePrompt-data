Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) by selecting \(n\) integers from the array \(b_i\) and arranging them to form the array \(c_i\).

### Approach Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\), the array \(a_i\), and the array \(b_i\).

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if both \(a\) and \(c\) (initially \(b\)) have the same single element. If they do, the maximum difference \(D\) is 0 because all elements are the same.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts \(a\) in ascending order and \(c\) in descending order. This is a key step because it ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.

4. **Greedy Selection:**
   - The program uses a greedy approach to select elements from \(c\) to maximize the differences:
     - It maintains two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse \(a\) from the start and end, respectively.
     - For each element in \(a\), it calculates the potential differences using the smallest and largest remaining elements in \(c\).
     - It chooses the larger of these differences and adds it to the total difference \(D\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where \(n = 1\) separately, calculating the maximum difference by comparing the single element of \(a\) with the maximum and minimum elements of \(c\).

### Correctness Verification:

- **Sorting and Greedy Selection:**
  - Sorting \(a\) and \(c\) in opposite orders and then using a greedy approach to maximize the differences is a correct strategy. This ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first, leading to an optimal solution.

- **Special Cases:**
  - The special case where all elements in \(a\) and \(c\) are the same is correctly handled by returning 0.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The edge case where \(n = 1\) is also correctly handled by comparing the single element of \(a\) with the maximum and minimum elements of \(c\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference \(D\). It handles all specified cases and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
