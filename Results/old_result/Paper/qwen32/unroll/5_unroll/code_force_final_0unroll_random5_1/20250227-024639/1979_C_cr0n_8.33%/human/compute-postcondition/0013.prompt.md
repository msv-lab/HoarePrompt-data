You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `N` is the integer value read from input; `vals` is a list of integers read from the input; `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is the integer value read from input, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`, `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: - The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`.
    #
    #Given the above explanation, the output of the code snippet is a space-separated string of the values in `vprod`, where each value is calculated as `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
