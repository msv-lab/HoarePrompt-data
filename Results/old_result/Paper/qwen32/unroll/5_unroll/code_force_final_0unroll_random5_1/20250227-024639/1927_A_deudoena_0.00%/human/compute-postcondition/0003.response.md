The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `outind`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`; `inpstr` is assigned the value of the input string; `ind1` is 0; `ind2` is 0; `outind` is 0.**
