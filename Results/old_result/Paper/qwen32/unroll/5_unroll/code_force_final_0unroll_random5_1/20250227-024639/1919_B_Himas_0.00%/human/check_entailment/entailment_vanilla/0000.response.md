Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string for each test case and prints that difference. However, the task requires finding the minimum possible penalty after optimally splitting the array formed by the string into subarrays. The penalty for each subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the goal is to minimize the total penalty.

The provided program does not perform any splitting or penalty calculation. It simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints their difference, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
