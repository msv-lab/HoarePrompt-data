Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Problem Recap
The task is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes in such a way that, for any winning outcome `i`, the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back, which is the bet on outcome `i` multiplied by `k_i`. The multipliers `k_i` are integers between 2 and 20.

### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula:
\[ \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \]
where GCD is the greatest common divisor. This is correct for computing the LCM.

#### Function 2: `func_2(numbers)`
This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the current result and the next number in the list. The final result is the LCM of all numbers in the list. This is correct for computing the LCM of a list of numbers.

#### Main Logic
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list `k` of multipliers.
2. **Computing LCM**: It computes the LCM `m` of the multipliers `k` using `func_2`.
3. **Calculating Bets**: It calculates the bets `c` for each outcome as `m // k[i]`.
4. **Checking Validity**: It checks if the sum of the bets is less than `m`. If not, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the bets.

### Correctness Verification
The key idea is to ensure that the sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The bets are calculated as `m // k[i]` where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers. This ensures that for any winning outcome `i`, the amount received (`k[i] * (m // k[i])`) is equal to `m`, which is greater than the sum of all bets (since the sum of the bets is `m // k[1] + m // k[2] + ... + m // k[n]` and this sum is strictly less than `m` due to the properties of LCM and the fact that `k_i >= 2` for all `i`).

### Conclusion
The program correctly computes the bets by leveraging the LCM of the multipliers to ensure the required condition is met. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
