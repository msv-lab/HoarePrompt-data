You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.

        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: `p` is the permutation constructed for the last test case, and `mex` is the minimum excluded value from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a permutation `p` of the list `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) based on the provided problem description. Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - It initializes the permutation array \( p \) with -1.
   - It sets the initial MEX value to \( n \).

3. **Iterative Construction**:
   - The program iterates over the array \( a \) in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element \( a[i] \), it calculates the corresponding \( p[i] \) using the formula \( p[i] = \text{MEX} - a[i] \).
   - It then updates the MEX value to be the minimum of the current MEX and \( p[i] \).

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation \( p \) for the current test case, it prints the permutation.

### Analysis of the Approach:

- The program is attempting to construct the permutation \( p \) by working backwards from the array \( a \). This approach is valid because the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation \( p \) exists for the given array \( a \).

- The key point here is the correct calculation of the MEX value. The MEX value is updated to be the minimum of the current MEX and the newly calculated \( p[i] \). This ensures that the MEX value is always the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet been used in the permutation \( p \).

- The program iterates over the array \( a \) in reverse order to ensure that the MEX value is correctly calculated for each element of \( p \). This is because the MEX value depends on the elements of \( p \) that have already been calculated.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) using the given approach. Since the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation \( p \) exists, the program will always produce a valid permutation.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
