The code snippet assigns the value `-1` to the variable `pos`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`, `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search boundaries in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
