To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the provided loop step by step.

The loop iterates over each element `v` in the list `arr`. For each element, it calculates the XOR of `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list, and appends the result to the `prefix` list.

**Initial State Recap:**
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9.
- `prefix` is a list containing a single element, 0.

**Loop Execution:**
The loop processes each element `v` in `arr` as follows:
1. `prefix[-1]` is the last element of the `prefix` list.
2. `v ^ prefix[-1]` computes the XOR of `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list.
3. The result is appended to the `prefix` list.

After the loop completes, `prefix` will contain `n + 1` elements. The first element is always `0` (initially set), and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR results of the elements in `arr`.

**Output State:**
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `prefix` is a list with `n + 1` elements, where the first element is `0` and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR results of the elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list with `n + 1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR results of the elements in `arr`.**
