To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the code inside the loop for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in each iteration:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, `n` and `k` are read from the input. `nums` is initialized to a list of the first 24 powers of 2 (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^23]`).

2. **Finding the appropriate index**: The code finds the largest index `idx` such that `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) is less than or equal to `k`. This is done by incrementing `idx` until `1 << idx` exceeds `k`, then decrementing `idx` by 1.

3. **Modifying the list `nums`**:
   - `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) is removed from `nums`.
   - Three new elements are added to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]` (which is `k - 2^idx`)
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1` (which is `k + 2^idx + 1`)

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the modified `nums` list is printed.
   - The elements of the modified `nums` list are printed.

The initial state of `t` (the number of test cases) remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are re-read for each test case. The list `nums` is re-initialized for each test case as well. Therefore, the state of `t`, `n`, and `k` after all test cases have been processed will be the same as the initial state for `t`, and `n` and `k` will no longer be relevant as they are only used within the loop.

Since the code does not modify `t` and initializes `n` and `k` anew for each iteration, the final output state will be the same as the initial state for `t`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**
