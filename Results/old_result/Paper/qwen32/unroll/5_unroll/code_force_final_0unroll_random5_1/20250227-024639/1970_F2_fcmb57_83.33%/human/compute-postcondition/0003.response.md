Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99) and `a` is odd, and `b` is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99) and `b` is odd. The function returns `x + dx, y + dy`, where `dx` is equal to `b` and `dy` is equal to `b`. However, since `x` and `y` are not defined within the function, this would result in a NameError.**
