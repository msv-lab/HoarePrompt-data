Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the described problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (N and M).
   - It then reads the field configuration and identifies the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - Players are stored in a dictionary `players` with their positions.
   - Goals are stored in a dictionary `goals` with separate lists for red and blue goals.
   - The movements dictionary `mouvements` maps movement commands ('L', 'R', 'U', 'D') to corresponding coordinate changes.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves `moves`.
   - It iterates through each move and processes it based on the type of action:
     - **Movement Commands ('ULDR'):** The program updates the player's position using the `func_1` function, which adds the movement vector to the player's current position.
     - **Catch Command ('C'):** The program does not handle the 'C' command at all, which is crucial for the game logic. Catching the Quaffle is necessary before a player can throw it.
     - **Throw Command ('T'):** The program checks if the player is at a goal of the opposite team and updates the score accordingly. It prints the appropriate goal message and resets the Quaffle's position to the center of the field.

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the goal messages with the correct time and team names.
   - It prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Issues Identified

- **Missing 'C' Command Handling:**
  - The program does not handle the 'C' command, which means players can throw the Quaffle without catching it first. This is a significant issue because the problem description explicitly states that a player must catch the Quaffle before throwing it.
  
- **Incorrect Reset of Quaffle Position:**
  - The problem description specifies that the Quaffle should move to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. However, the program does not actually move the Quaffle to the middle of the field. It only updates the score and prints the goal message. This is a minor issue compared to the missing 'C' command handling, but it still affects the game state.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, particularly the missing handling of the 'C' command, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
