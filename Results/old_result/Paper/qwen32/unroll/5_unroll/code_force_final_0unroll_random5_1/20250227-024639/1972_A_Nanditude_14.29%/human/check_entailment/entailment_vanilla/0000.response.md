Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to ensure that the difficulties of the proposed problems (`a`) are less than or equal to the expected difficulties (`b`) by adding the minimum number of new problems. Each time a new problem is added, the highest difficulty problem is removed from `a` and the list is re-sorted.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`: Number of problems, `a`: List of current problem difficulties, and `b`: List of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Logic**:
   - Initialize `cnt` to count the number of new problems added.
   - Use two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate over `a` and `b` respectively.
   - While `i` and `j` are less than `n`:
     - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, it means we need to add a new problem of difficulty `b[j]` to `a` to match the expected difficulty. The highest difficulty problem in `a` is removed, and `b[j]` is inserted at the position `i` in `a`. The count `cnt` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next expected difficulty.
     - Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented, moving to the next problem in both lists.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all problems for a test case, the number of new problems added (`cnt`) is printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program attempts to insert `b[j]` into `a` at position `i` and then remove the last element, but it does not re-sort `a` after insertion, which is crucial for maintaining the non-decreasing order.
- The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the described logic because it does not maintain the sorted order of `a` after inserting a new problem difficulty.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the lack of re-sorting `a` after inserting a new problem difficulty.

**Correctness: False**
