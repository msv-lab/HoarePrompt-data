Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers. For each test case, it determines if the lists can be made identical by inserting a specific element at a certain position. It prints 'yes' if it's possible to make the lists identical for all test cases, otherwise it prints 'no'.**
