You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the gaps between the integers in the list and their positions relative to the range from 1 to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed in a regular polygon with `n` sides, given `x` vertices that have already been chosen and no additional vertices can be chosen (`y = 0`). The triangles must be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices.

### Key Points:
1. **Vertices and Triangles**: Triangles can be formed by connecting three vertices with non-intersecting diagonals.
2. **No Additional Vertices**: Since `y = 0`, we can only use the `x` vertices already chosen.
3. **Counting Triangles**: We need to count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with these `x` vertices.

### Approach in the Code:
The code attempts to count the number of triangles by:
1. Sorting the list of chosen vertices.
2. Checking the gaps between consecutive vertices.
3. Counting how many gaps have exactly one vertex between them, as these gaps can potentially form triangles.
4. Also checking the gap between the first and last vertex considering the circular nature of the polygon.
5. Finally, adding `x - 2` to the count, which seems to be an incorrect assumption since it does not correctly account for the formation of triangles.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Triangle Counting**: The code incorrectly assumes that counting gaps with exactly one vertex between them and adding `x - 2` will give the correct number of triangles. This is not correct because forming triangles involves more complex combinatorial logic.
2. **Circular Nature of Polygon**: While the code attempts to handle the circular nature by checking the gap between the first and last vertex, it does not correctly account for all possible triangles.
3. **No Consideration for Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The code does not ensure that the diagonals drawn do not intersect, which is a crucial requirement for forming non-intersecting triangles.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed. The logic for counting triangles is flawed and does not correctly account for the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
