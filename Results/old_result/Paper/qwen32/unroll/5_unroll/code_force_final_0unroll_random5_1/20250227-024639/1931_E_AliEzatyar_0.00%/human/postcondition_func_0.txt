The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. However, the function only examines the last element of the `num` list and counts the number of trailing '0' strings in reverse order until a non-'0' element is encountered. The function returns the count of these trailing '0' strings. Given the provided return postcondition, the function always returns 1, indicating that there is exactly one trailing '0' string in the last element of the `num` list.
