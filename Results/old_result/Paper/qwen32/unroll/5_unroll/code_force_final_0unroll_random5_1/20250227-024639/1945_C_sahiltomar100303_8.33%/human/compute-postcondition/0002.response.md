Output State: **For each test case, the output is the optimal position to place the dividing line such that the number of 0s on the left side and 1s on the right side are maximized according to the given conditions. The variables `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` will be reset to their initial values at the start of each test case iteration.**
