Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, followed by a string a of length n consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 if the resident wants to live on the right side. The total number of houses across all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 2·10^4.**
