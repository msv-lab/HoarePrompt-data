Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of integers in the list and `k` is an integer. It returns a list `nums` of `n` integers where the first element is the maximum value that can be represented with the number of bits equal to the bit length of `k`, minus one, plus any remaining `k` after distributing values to subsequent elements, and the rest of the elements are as large as possible up to that value or zero if `k` is exhausted.**
