### Reasoning:

The provided Python program `func_1` is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to a maximum value (200,000 in this case). This precomputation is done once at the start and stored in the `values` array. For each test case, the program simply looks up the precomputed value in the `values` array and prints it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `values` of size `inf` (200,001) with all elements set to 0.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates through each number `i` from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`).
   - It updates the `values` array such that `values[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. This is achieved by adding `sum_value_digits` to `values[i - 1]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each of the `t` test cases, the program reads an integer `n`.
   - It prints the precomputed cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n` from the `values` array.

### Analysis:

- **Precomputation Efficiency**:
  - Precomputing the cumulative sums of digit sums up to 200,000 is efficient given the constraints. The maximum number of digits for any number up to 200,000 is 6, and iterating through these digits for each number up to 200,000 is feasible within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

- **Correctness**:
  - The logic for calculating the sum of digits and maintaining the cumulative sum is correct.
  - The program efficiently handles the input and output for each test case by leveraging the precomputed values.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
