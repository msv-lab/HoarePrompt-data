The code snippet provided initializes a variable `sub_summ` to 0. This action does not affect the lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, which retain their original states. The only change is the introduction of the variable `sub_summ` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers; `sub_summ` is 0.**
