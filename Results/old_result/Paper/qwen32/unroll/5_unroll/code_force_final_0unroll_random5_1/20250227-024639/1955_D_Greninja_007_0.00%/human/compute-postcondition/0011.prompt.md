You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Similarly, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(a, b, k, n, m):
    good_subarrays = 0
    b_freq = Counter(b)
    window_freq = Counter(a[:m])
    matches = sum(min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in
    b_freq)
    for i in range(n - m):
        if matches >= k:
            good_subarrays += 1
        
        if a[i] in b_freq:
            matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])
        
        window_freq[a[i]] -= 1
        
        if window_freq[a[i]] == 0:
            del window_freq[a[i]]
        
        if a[i + m] in b_freq:
            matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])
        
        window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1
        
    #State: good_subarrays is the count of subarrays of length m in a that have at least k matching elements with b based on frequency, window_freq reflects the frequency of elements in the last m elements of a, and matches reflects the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements in the last m elements of a that also appear in b.
    if (matches >= k) :
        good_subarrays += 1
    #State: `good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` matching elements with `b` based on frequency. If the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. `window_freq` reflects the frequency of elements in the last `m` elements of `a`, and `matches` reflects the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements in the last `m` elements of `a` that also appear in `b`.
    return good_subarrays
    #The program returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` matching elements with `b` based on frequency.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and two integers `k` and `m`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` matching elements with `b` based on frequency.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` matching elements with `b` based on frequency.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
