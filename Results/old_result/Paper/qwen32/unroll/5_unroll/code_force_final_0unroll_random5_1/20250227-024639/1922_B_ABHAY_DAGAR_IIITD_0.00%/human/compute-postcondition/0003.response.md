The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`. Therefore, according to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. 

For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The variable `result` will be assigned the first element of the `results` list during the first iteration.

State: **`results` is a list containing the calculated results for each test case and must have at least 1 result, `result` is the first element in the list**
