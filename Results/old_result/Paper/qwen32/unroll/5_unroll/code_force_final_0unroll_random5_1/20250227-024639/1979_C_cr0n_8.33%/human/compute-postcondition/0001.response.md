The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `vals`. This means that `vals` will now hold the list of integers that were provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `N` is the integer value read from input; `vals` is a list of integers read from the input.**
