test_cases is a list of strings, where each string s is of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. The integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) represents the number of test cases and is equal to the length of the test_cases list. Each "hh" is a two-digit string from "00" to "23", and each "mm" is a two-digit string from "00" to "59".
