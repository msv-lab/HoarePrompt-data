You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
   - There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
2. The sequence `b` is a subsequence of `a` if `b` can be obtained from `a` by deleting several (possibly zero or all) elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
3. The size of the sequence `a` should be at most 25.
4. The solution always exists under the given constraints.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reads `n` and `k`.
3. Initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^{23}]`).
4. Finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` (denoted as `1 << idx`).
5. Removes this power of 2 from `nums`.
6. Appends three new numbers to `nums`:
   - `k - (1 << idx)`
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + (1 << idx) + 1`
7. Prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to check two main conditions:
1. **No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`:**
   - The number `k` is constructed in such a way that it cannot be formed by any combination of the elements in `nums` after the power of 2 less than or equal to `k` is removed and the new numbers are added.
   - The new numbers added (`k - (1 << idx)`, `k + 1`, `k + (1 << idx) + 1`) ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `nums`.

2. **All sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed:**
   - The initial list `nums` contains powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\) using binary representation.
   - After removing the power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and adding the new numbers, the list `nums` should still be able to form all sums from `1` to `n` except `k`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's take the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
- Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{23}]`
- Largest power of 2 ≤ 2 is 2 (i.e., `1 << 1`).
- Remove 2 from `nums`.
- Append `2 - 2 = 0`, `2 + 1 = 3`, `2 + 2 + 1 = 5` to `nums`.
- New `nums`: `[1, 4, ..., 2^{23}, 0, 3, 5]`.
- The sequence `[1]` can form sums from `1` to `2` except `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. The logic ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a subsequence sum, and all other sums from `1` to `n` can be formed.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for each test case.
Correctness: **True**
