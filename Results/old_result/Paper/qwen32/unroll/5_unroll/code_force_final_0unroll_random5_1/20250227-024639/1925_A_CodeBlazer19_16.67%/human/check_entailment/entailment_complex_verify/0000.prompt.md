You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, and `n`, `k`, and `s` do not retain any specific values after the loop as they are overwritten in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a string `s` of length `k` using the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. Otherwise, it prints the string `s` repeated either once or twice, depending on whether `n` is 1 or greater than 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program only appends the first `k` letters of the alphabet to `s` and then either repeats this string `n` times or a few times based on the value of `n`, which is not sufficient to ensure all possible substrings of length `n` are present as subsequences.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`:
- The possible substrings of length 2 using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets are: `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`.
- The program would output `baab` for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, which is correct in this case.
- However, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the possible substrings are: `aaa`, `aab`, `aba`, `abb`, `baa`, `bab`, `bba`, `bbb`.
- The program would output `baab` (or `abab` if `k == 1` case is not considered), which does not contain all the required substrings as subsequences.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
