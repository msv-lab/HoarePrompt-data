### Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the provided code does not address the problem description. However, upon closer inspection and considering the annotated version of the code, we can see that the code does attempt to solve the problem, albeit in a different manner than the simple approach suggested in the assessment.

Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`. This is a valid way to compute the LCM.

2. **Function `func_2(numbers)`**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list. The final result is the LCM of all numbers in the list.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the code reads `n` (number of outcomes) and `k` (list of multipliers).
   - It calculates the LCM `m` of the multipliers.
   - It then computes the bets `c` for each outcome as `m // k[i]`.
   - It checks if the sum of these bets is less than `m`. If not, it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the bets.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the total bet is a common divisor of the returns for all outcomes. This is a sophisticated approach to ensure that the total bet is less than the return for each outcome.
  
- **Bet Calculation**: By setting each bet `c[i]` to `m // k[i]`, the code ensures that if the `i-th` outcome is the winning one, the return will be `k[i] * c[i] = k[i] * (m // k[i]) = m`, which is greater than the total bet `sum(c)`, as long as `sum(c) < m`.

- **Validation**: The check `if sum(c) >= m` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each winning outcome. If this condition is not met, the code correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements a solution to the problem by leveraging the LCM to distribute the bets in a way that satisfies the conditions of the game. The original assessment incorrectly dismisses the code's validity by not recognizing the correctness of the LCM-based approach.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
