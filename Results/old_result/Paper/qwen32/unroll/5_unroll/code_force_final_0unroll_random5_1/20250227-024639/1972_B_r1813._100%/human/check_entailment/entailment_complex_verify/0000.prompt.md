You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters directly, but it is expected to read input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t is 2, data is ['2', '5', 'UUNNU', '3', 'UUU'], index is 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing 'U' and 'D'. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the string is odd, otherwise it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The problem description states that the game involves a circular arrangement of coins, where each player takes turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The player who cannot make a move loses, and the task is to determine if Alice (who goes first) will win if both players play optimally.

The provided solution takes a different approach. Instead of simulating the game, it simply counts the number of facing-up coins ('U') and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. Specifically, if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Let's verify if this strategy is correct:

1. **Odd Number of 'U' Coins:**
   - If there is an odd number of 'U' coins, Alice can always remove a 'U' coin, leaving an even number of 'U' coins for Bob. Bob will then be forced to remove a 'U' coin, leaving an odd number of 'U' coins for Alice again. This pattern continues until there is only one 'U' coin left, which Alice can remove, making Bob the one who cannot make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

2. **Even Number of 'U' Coins:**
   - If there is an even number of 'U' coins, Alice removes a 'U' coin, leaving an odd number of 'U' coins for Bob. Bob can then remove a 'U' coin, leaving an even number of 'U' coins for Alice again. This pattern continues until there are two 'U' coins left. At this point, Alice removes one 'U' coin, leaving one 'U' coin for Bob. Bob can then remove the last 'U' coin, and Alice cannot make a move. Hence, Bob wins.

Given this reasoning, the solution provided is correct for all possible cases. It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of 'U' coins.

**Explanation:**
The program reads the input, counts the number of 'U' coins for each test case, and prints "YES" if the count is odd (indicating Alice wins) and "NO" if the count is even (indicating Bob wins). This strategy is optimal and covers all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
