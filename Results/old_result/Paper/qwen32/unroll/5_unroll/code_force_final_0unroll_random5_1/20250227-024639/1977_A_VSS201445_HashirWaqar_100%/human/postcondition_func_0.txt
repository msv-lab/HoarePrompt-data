The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference (`n - m`) is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input values but uses them to determine the output for each test case.
