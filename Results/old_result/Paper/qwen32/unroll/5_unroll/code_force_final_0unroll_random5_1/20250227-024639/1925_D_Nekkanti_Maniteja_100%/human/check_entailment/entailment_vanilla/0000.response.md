Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads `m` lines of input, each containing a pair of friends `(a_i, b_i)` and their initial friendship value `f_i`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), the modulus for the final result.
   - `c` is set to the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). This is used to calculate the probability of selecting a specific pair.
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the expected sum of friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

3. **Processing Friendships:**
   - For each of the `m` friend pairs, the program adds their initial friendship value `f_i` to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program then iterates `k` times (for each excursion).
   - In each iteration, it calculates a term that is added to `s`. The term involves `c` and `i` (the current iteration number), which is an attempt to calculate the contribution of each friend pair's friendship values to the expected sum over `k` excursions.
   - However, the calculation of the term inside the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The correct approach should involve calculating the expected value contribution of each friend pair over `k` excursions, considering their initial friendship values and the increase in friendship values due to being chosen.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the accumulated sum `s` modulo \(M\).

### Correctness Analysis:

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected sum of friendship values for the following reasons:
- The method for calculating the expected sum inside the loop is flawed. It does not correctly account for the increase in friendship values for each friend pair over `k` excursions.
- The formula used in the loop does not align with the expected value calculation based on probability and the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the expected sum of friendship values.

**Correctness: False**
