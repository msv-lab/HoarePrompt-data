You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it determines and prints an integer `k` that satisfies all the given constraints. Specifically, it finds an integer `k` that is greater than or equal to the maximum value specified by constraints of type 1, less than or equal to the minimum value specified by constraints of type 2, and not equal to any value specified by constraints of type 3.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Constraints**:
   - Type 1: k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.
   - Type 2: k must be less than or equal to some integer x.
   - Type 3: k must be not equal to some integer x.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints.
   - Ensure that the output is the count of integers k that meet all conditions.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints.
   - It then reads each constraint and categorizes them into three lists:
     - `big`: Contains the values from constraints of type 1.
     - `less`: Contains the values from constraints of type 2.
     - `no`: Contains the values from constraints of type 3.
   - The program calculates the range of possible values for k using `max(big)` and `min(less)`.
   - It then iterates through this range to count the integers that are not in the `no` list.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of constraints for each test case.
   - It categorizes the constraints appropriately into `big`, `less`, and `no` lists.

2. **Calculating Range**:
   - The program calculates the lower bound of k using `max(big)`, which is correct because k must be greater than or equal to the maximum of all "greater than or equal to" constraints.
   - The program calculates the upper bound of k using `min(less)`, which is correct because k must be less than or equal to the minimum of all "less than or equal to" constraints.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - The program iterates through the calculated range and counts the integers that are not in the `no` list.
   - However, the current implementation incorrectly assigns the first valid integer it finds to `num` and breaks out of the loop. This means it only finds one valid integer instead of counting all valid integers.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly counts the number of valid integers k. Instead of counting all valid integers in the range, it only finds and prints the first valid integer it encounters. This is not the expected behavior as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
