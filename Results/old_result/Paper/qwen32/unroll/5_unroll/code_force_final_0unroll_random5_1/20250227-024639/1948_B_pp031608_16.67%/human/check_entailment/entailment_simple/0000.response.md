### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array, and for each test case, it checks if the array can be sorted using the described operation. 

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program iterates over the array, checking if the current element is greater than the next one and if the current element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - The function `func_1(lst)` is used to check whether the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The function `func_1(lst)` sorts the list and compares it to the original list. If they are the same, the list is sorted.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Logic Error in Splitting Elements**:
   - The current logic for splitting elements is incorrect. The loop iterates over the array, but it does not handle the case where splitting an element results in a new array that might still need further splitting.
   - For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]` and the program splits `12` into `1` and `2`, the new array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`. However, the program does not check if further splitting is needed for `45` or `67`.

2. **Infinite Loop Possibility**:
   - The program does not ensure that the array will eventually be sorted or that the loop will terminate. If the array requires multiple splits to be sorted, the current logic will not handle that.

3. **Incorrect Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `for p in range(1, len(list1)):` is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of the array length changing after splitting elements. This can lead to index errors or incorrect behavior.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
