Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases. Specifically, it fails to account for scenarios where the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`. 

Let's consider an example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  2 3
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  No
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  NO
  ```
  This part is correct in terms of the output format, but the logic is incorrect. The program will output "NO" because `n < m` (2 < 3), but the logic should be reconsidered.

The correct logic should be that if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`. Therefore, the condition `n >= m` is correct, but the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is not sufficient to cover all cases.

The correct condition should be:
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, then "YES"
- Otherwise, "NO"

However, the program only checks `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` and does not cover the scenario where `n < m`, which should always result in "NO".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# The above logic is mostly correct, but let's add a more explicit check for n < m
def func_corrected():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

The original program does not handle the case where `n < m` correctly, so it is incorrect.
