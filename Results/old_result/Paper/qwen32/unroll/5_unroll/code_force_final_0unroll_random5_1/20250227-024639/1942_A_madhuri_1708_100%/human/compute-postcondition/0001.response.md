To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the provided code:

1. The code reads multiple test cases from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
3. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2:
   - If `n` equals `k`, it prints a list of `k` elements where each element is `k`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
4. If `k` is less than 2, it prints a list of `n` elements where each element is the integer from 1 to `n`.

The initial state includes `t` test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are provided. After processing all test cases, the code will have printed the results based on the conditions described above.

Since the code doesn't modify any global state other than printing, the only state that changes is the output generated by the print statements.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each representing the result of a test case. Each result is either a list of integers or `-1`, depending on the values of `n` and `k` for that test case.**
