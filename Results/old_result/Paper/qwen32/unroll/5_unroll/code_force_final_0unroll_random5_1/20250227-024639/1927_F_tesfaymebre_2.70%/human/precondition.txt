n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it satisfies 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min((n*(n - 1))/2, 2 * 10^5) where m is the number of edges. The graph is described by a list of edges, each edge is a tuple (u, v, w) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. There is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
