Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` where the first element is the number of test cases `t`, and the subsequent elements are test cases each containing an integer `n`, a list `a` of length `n`, and a list `b` of length `n`. The function returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order, with the test cases themselves sorted in descending lexicographical order.**
