### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that each element `a_i` in the input array satisfies `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- `MEX` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array up to that point.
- There is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given `a`.

#### Program Analysis:

The provided program initializes a permutation `p` with `-1` and a variable `mex` with `n`. It then iterates from the end of the array `a` to the beginning, updating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and adjusting `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

Here are the annotations and states:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Length of the array `a`.
     - `a`: The input array.
     - `p`: An array initialized with `-1` of length `n`.
     - `mex`: Initialized to `n`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - Iterate from the end of `a` to the beginning (`for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`).
   - For each index `i`, compute `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - Update `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the constructed permutation `p`.

#### Evaluation with Annotations:

Let's consider the first test case from the example:
```
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
- **Initialization**:
  - `n = 5`
  - `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`
  - `mex = 5`

- **Iteration**:
  - **i = 4**:
    - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`
    - `mex = min(mex, p[4]) = min(5, 3) = 3`
    - `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 3]`
  - **i = 3**:
    - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`
    - `mex = min(mex, p[3]) = min(3, 2) = 2`
    - `p = [-1, -1, -1, 2, 3]`
  - **i = 2**:
    - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`
    - `mex = min(mex, p[2]) = min(2, 4) = 2`
    - `p = [-1, -1, 4, 2, 3]`
  - **i = 1**:
    - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
    - `mex = min(mex, p[1]) = min(2, 1) = 1`
    - `p = [-1, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
  - **i = 0**:
    - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
    - `mex = min(mex, p[0]) = min(1, 0) = 0`
    - `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

The output for this test case is `0 1 4 2 3`, which is correct.

#### Potential Issues:
The program's approach of maintaining a single `mex` variable and updating it in a backward manner is flawed. The `mex` should be dynamically recalculated based on the elements already placed in `p` up to the current index. The provided program does not ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly compute the permutation `p`, we need to maintain a set of available numbers (initially all numbers from `0` to `n-1`) and update it as we construct `p`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the computation of `MEX` and constructing the permutation `p`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Final: False**
