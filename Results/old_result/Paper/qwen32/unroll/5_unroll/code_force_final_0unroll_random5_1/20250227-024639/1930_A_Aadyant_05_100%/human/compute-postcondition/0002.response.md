To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for num in range(int(n))`. This means the variables `num` and `n` are relevant. However, only `n` can be directly adjusted before the loop starts since `num` is the loop variable and gets assigned values during the loop execution.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute `int(n)` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(n)` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is a string representation of an integer and `1 <= int(n) <= 50`, `n` should be a string that represents an integer in this range.

2. **Variable `num`**: This is the loop variable and gets assigned values from 0 to `int(n) - 1` during each iteration. We do not need to adjust `num` before the loop starts because it is not defined before the loop begins and gets its values during the loop iterations.

3. **Other variables (`t`, `a`, `final`)**: These variables are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints, `n` should be a string representation of an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `final`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(n) <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `final` is an empty list**
