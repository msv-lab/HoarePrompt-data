To determine the state adjustments needed for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just the variable `i` and the range `t`.

The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute if and only if `t` is greater than 0. Given the problem statement, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. This means that `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1, and thus the loop will execute at least once.

Since the state before the loop starts includes `t` being an integer within the specified range, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes. The variable `i` is the loop control variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so no adjustment to `i` is needed either.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
