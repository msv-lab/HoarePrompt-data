You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x / 2`. If no such divisor exists, it returns 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always find the integer \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Let's analyze the code and provide a counterexample.

The function `func_1(x)` iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2, checking if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)). If it is, it checks if \( 2 * y \geq x \). If this condition is met, it immediately returns \( y \). Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues. Finally, it returns `max_val` if no earlier return occurred.

This approach does not guarantee that the returned \( y \) maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because it only considers divisors of \( x \) and does not explore non-divisors that might yield a higher sum.

Let's consider a counterexample:

For \( x = 12 \):
- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.
- The function will check these divisors in descending order.
- When it reaches \( y = 6 \), it will find that \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2 * 6 \geq 12 \), so it will return \( y = 6 \).
- The value of \( \gcd(12, 6) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 \).

However, there is a better choice:
- For \( y = 8 \), \( \gcd(12, 8) = 4 \) and \( \gcd(12, 8) + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12 \).
- For \( y = 10 \), \( \gcd(12, 10) = 2 \) and \( \gcd(12, 10) + 10 = 2 + 10 = 12 \).
- For \( y = 11 \), \( \gcd(12, 11) = 1 \) and \( \gcd(12, 11) + 11 = 1 + 11 = 12 \).

In this case, \( y = 6 \) is not optimal because \( y = 8, 10, 11 \) all yield the same maximum sum of 12. However, the function does not explore non-divisors and might miss better solutions in other cases.

Thus, the code is not always correct, and the Correctness is **False**.
