### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` containers with water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from container `i` to container `j` if `i < j`.
- We need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Annotations:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n` is the number of containers for each test case.
- `nums` is the list of water amounts in the containers.
- `last` is the amount of water in the last container.
- `curr` is initialized to 0 and is supposed to accumulate some value based on the differences between elements in `nums` and `last`.
- The program prints 'YES' if `curr == 0`, otherwise 'NO'.

#### Issues in the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `curr`:**
   - The program calculates `curr` by iterating through `nums` and adding `i - last` for each non-zero `i`. This does not correctly check if the water can be evenly distributed.
   - The logic does not ensure that the cumulative sum of water levels up to any point can be adjusted to the average level.

2. **Ignoring the Average Level:**
   - The program does not calculate the target level of water for each container, which is `total_sum / n`.
   - Without the target level, the program cannot properly determine if the water can be distributed correctly.

3. **No Handling of Prefix Sums:**
   - The correct approach involves using prefix sums and checking if the cumulative difference can be adjusted to reach the average level for all containers.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Calculate the target level of water for each container, which is `total_sum / n`.
- Use prefix sums to check if the cumulative difference can be adjusted to reach this target level.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        target = total_sum // n
        prefix_sum = 0
        can_equalize = True
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += nums[i]
            if prefix_sum % n != (target * (i + 1)) % n:
                can_equalize = False
                break
        print('YES' if can_equalize else 'NO')

# Example input handling
func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the conditions required to equalize the water levels in all containers. It fails to calculate the target level and does not use prefix sums to verify the distribution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
