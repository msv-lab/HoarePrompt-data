You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The sum of the integers in each inner list is divisible by n. The length of nums (t) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The sum of the integers in each inner list is divisible by `n`. The length of `nums` (t) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the sum of all integers in `nums` and `total` is divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: curr is 0.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `nums`, where each inner list contains integers representing the amounts of water in containers for different test cases. It checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in each test case such that all containers have the same amount of water. If redistribution is possible for all test cases, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition for making all containers have the same amount of water. Specifically, the check `if curr < 0` is incorrect. This check is intended to determine whether it's possible to redistribute the water such that no container ever has less water than its target amount during the redistribution process. However, the current implementation incorrectly returns 'NO' if at any point the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target mean becomes negative, which is not necessarily a valid condition to determine the impossibility of redistribution.

Here is a counterexample where the program returns 'NO' incorrectly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The total amount of water is 6, and the mean is 2.
- We can redistribute the water as follows:
  - Pour 1 unit from the third container to the first container: [2, 2, 2].

However, the provided program will return 'NO' for this input because the cumulative difference `curr` will become -1 at some point during the iteration, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

To fix the program, the logic should be adjusted to ensure that the water can be redistributed without violating the constraints given in the problem description. The current implementation does not correctly handle the redistribution logic, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
