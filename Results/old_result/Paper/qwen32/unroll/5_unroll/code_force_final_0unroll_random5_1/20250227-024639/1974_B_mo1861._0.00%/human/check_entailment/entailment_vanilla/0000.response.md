Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - A new string `r` is created from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in the original string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given an encoded string `b`, we need to restore the original string `s`.
   - This involves reversing the encoding process.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Logic (`func_1` function):**
   - **Creating the Character Map:**
     - `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric character.
     - The symmetric character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which is incorrect.
     - The correct symmetric character should be the character at the mirrored position in the sorted set of `b`, not a character based on the length of `b`.
   - **Building the Decoded String `s`:**
     - The decoded string `s` is constructed by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`.

### Errors in the Program:
- The calculation for the symmetric character in `char_map` is incorrect. Instead of using `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, it should map each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the same set.
- The provided program does not correctly map the characters to their symmetric counterparts in the context of the distinct characters of `b`.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Creating the Character Map:**
   - Sort the distinct characters of `b` to get `r`.
   - Map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Building the Decoded String:**
   - Replace each character in `b` with its mapped value from the character map.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the symmetric characters.

Correctness: **False**
