You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

    n = int(input())

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases)
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` (number of yogurts to buy)
   - `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30` (price of one yogurt and two yogurts respectively)

### Logic for Solution

To find the minimum cost:
- Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `n * a`
- Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs (with possible leftovers): 
  - Number of pairs: `n // 2`
  - Cost of pairs: `number_of_pairs * b`
  - Cost of leftover yogurt (if any): `(n % 2) * a`
  - Total cost for pairs: `number_of_pairs * b + (n % 2) * a`
- Compare the two costs and choose the minimum.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Misinterpretation of Input Variables**:
   - The program reads `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, but `c` is not used correctly. Instead, `b` should be the promotional price for two yogurts.
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. It seems like an attempt to calculate the average price per yogurt, but this is incorrect for the problem's logic.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. It seems to be comparing the cost of buying `b` yogurts individually with the cost of buying `d` yogurts individually, which does not make sense.
   - The `else` block `print(round(a * d))` is also incorrect. It seems to be attempting to print the cost of buying `d` yogurts individually, which is not the intended logic.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs (with possible leftovers)
        number_of_pairs = n // 2
        number_of_leftovers = n % 2
        cost_pairs = number_of_pairs * b + number_of_leftovers * a
        # Minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_pairs))

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of input variables and incorrect logic. 

Correctness: **False**
