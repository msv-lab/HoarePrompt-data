The code snippet provided initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the lists `arr` or `data`. Therefore, the lists `arr` and `data` retain their initial states.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 0.**
