The code snippet provided simply assigns the integer value `1` to the variable `index`. None of the other variables (`array`, `data`, `t`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100 and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, each string representing an integer from the input; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first string in `data`; `index` is 1.**
