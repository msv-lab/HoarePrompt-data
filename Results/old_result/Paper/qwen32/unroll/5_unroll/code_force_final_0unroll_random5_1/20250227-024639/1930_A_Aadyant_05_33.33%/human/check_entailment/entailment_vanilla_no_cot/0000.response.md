To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem statement and the provided example.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the minimum values of n pairs of numbers from a list of 2n numbers. The optimal strategy to achieve this is to sort the list and then sum the first n elements (which will be the minimums of the pairs).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the number of pairs, `n`.
2. It reads the 2n integers and stores them in a list.
3. It sorts the list.
4. It sums the first n elements of the sorted list (which correspond to the minimums of the pairs if we pair the sorted numbers).
5. It stores the result and prints it after processing all test cases.

### Code Review:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of pairs, `n`.
   - It reads the 2n integers and stores them in a list.
   - It sorts the list.
   - It sums the first n elements of the sorted list.
3. It prints the results for all test cases.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `1 2 3`
   - Sorted: `2 3`
   - Sum of first 1 element: `2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 1 2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
   - Sum of first 2 elements: `1 1`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `3 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Sum of first 3 elements: `1 1 1`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. It handles multiple test cases, sorts the list, and sums the appropriate elements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
