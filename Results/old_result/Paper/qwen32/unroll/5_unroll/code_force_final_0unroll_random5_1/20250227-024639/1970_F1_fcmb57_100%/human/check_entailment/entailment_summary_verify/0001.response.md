### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The field is a rectangle with goals for each team, players, and a Quaffle.
- Players can move, catch, and throw the Quaffle.
- A goal is scored when a player carrying the Quaffle places it in the opposing team's goal.
- The Quaffle resets to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
- If a player scores in their own goal, the other team gets a point.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The code correctly initializes the positions of players and goals.
   - The movement dictionary `mouvements` is correctly defined.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined correctly and updates the position of a player based on the movement direction.
   - The function is called appropriately when a player moves.

3. **Ball Handling:**
   - The Quaffle's position is not tracked, and there is no mechanism to determine who carries the Quaffle.
   - The Quaffle's position is not reset to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Goal Scoring:**
   - The code checks if a player is on a goal position to score points, but it does not verify if the player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The code does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal.

5. **Output:**
   - The output format is correct, but the logic for scoring and handling the Quaffle is incorrect.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - Multiple goals for each team are not handled correctly. The code assumes there is only one goal per team.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary for `func_1` is correct: it returns a tuple where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.

#### Challenging the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the program.
- The program does not handle the Quaffle's position or ball carrying, which are essential for scoring goals correctly.
- The program does not reset the Quaffle's position after a goal is scored.
- The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the program is not correct as it does not fully implement the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
