Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5 * 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^9.**

Natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input by the user, which is within the range of 1 to 50,000. The preconditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are specified for each test case that will follow.
