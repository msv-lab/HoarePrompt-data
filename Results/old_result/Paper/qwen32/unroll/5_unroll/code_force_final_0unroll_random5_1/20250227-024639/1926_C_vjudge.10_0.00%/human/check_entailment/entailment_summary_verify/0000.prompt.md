You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 200,000 and returns the sum of its digits.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. The main issue is that the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. The program reads the number of test cases but then incorrectly sums up the results of all test cases into a single variable `soma` and prints it only once after processing all test cases. This means the output will not be separated for each test case as required by the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program initializes `soma` outside the loop over test cases, which means it accumulates results from all test cases into one sum.
2. The program prints the final `soma` only once after processing all test cases, instead of printing the result for each test case separately.

To fix the program, you should initialize `soma` inside the loop for each test case and print the result for each test case immediately after processing it.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 instead of 0
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This corrected version initializes `soma` to 0 for each test case, processes the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and prints the result for each test case separately.
