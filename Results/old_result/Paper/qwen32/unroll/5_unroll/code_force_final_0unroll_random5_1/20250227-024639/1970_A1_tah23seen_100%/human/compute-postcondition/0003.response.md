Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the key `0` and the value `0`.**

In simple terms, the string `s` remains unchanged, its length `n` remains the same, `ans` is still an empty string, and the dictionary `d` now contains one entry with the key `0` and the value `0`.
