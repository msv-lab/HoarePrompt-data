Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and then prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
2. It then counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
3. Finally, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

The issue with this approach is that it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The penalty for a split is the sum of the penalties of the individual subarrays, where the penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal way to split the array. The provided program does not implement any logic to split the array or calculate the penalty for different splits.

For example, consider the test case:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct minimum penalty is 0, as the array can be split into `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, each of which has a penalty of 0. However, the provided program will output `0` only because the counts of '+' and '-' are equal, which is not a general solution for all test cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
