You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Objective**: Find the number of subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

2. **Approach**:
   - For each subarray of length `m` in `a`, check if it can be rearranged to have at least `k` matching elements with `b`.
   - Use a sliding window technique to efficiently count the number of matching elements in each subarray.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the current window of `a`.
   - Calculate the number of matching elements (`matches`) by taking the minimum of the counts of each element in the current window and in `b`.
   - Slide the window one element to the right, updating the counts and the number of matches accordingly.
   - Check if `matches` is at least `k` after each window update and increment the count of good subarrays if true.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the frequency counters for `b` and the first window of `a`.
   - It calculates the initial number of matches using the minimum frequency of common elements between the first window and `b`.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program slides the window one element to the right in a loop.
   - It updates the frequency counter for the element that is sliding out of the window and the element that is sliding into the window.
   - It adjusts the `matches` count accordingly by subtracting the contribution of the element sliding out and adding the contribution of the element sliding in.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to see if the last window is good.

### Correctness Check

- **Initialization**: The initial calculation of `matches` is correct.
- **Sliding Window Update**: The updates to the frequency counter and the `matches` count are correct.
- **Final Check**: The final check ensures that the last window is also considered.
- **Efficiency**: The sliding window technique ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n + m) per test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem by efficiently counting the number of good subarrays using a sliding window approach. There are no logical errors in the implementation.
