To determine the state modification required for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the loop condition. The loop is defined as:

```python
while n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In Python, the `while n:` loop will execute as long as `n` is truthy. A non-zero integer is considered truthy, while zero is considered falsy.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is 0
- `l` and `s` are calculated for each test case and printed
- `n` is an input integer

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to ensure it is not zero.

State: **`t` is 0, `l` and `s` are calculated for each test case and printed, `n` must be a non-zero integer**
