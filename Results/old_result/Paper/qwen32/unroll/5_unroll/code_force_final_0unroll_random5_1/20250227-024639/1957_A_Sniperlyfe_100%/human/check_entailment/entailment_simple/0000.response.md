Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is incorrect based on the problem description and the example inputs/outputs. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the sticks, but it incorrectly assumes that each polygon must be a triangle (since it divides the frequency of each stick length by 3). However, the problem does not specify that the polygons must be triangles; they could be any regular polygon with a minimum of 3 sides.

For example, in the third test case, the input is `6 2 2 3 3 3 3`. The program would output `1` because it only considers the possibility of forming triangles (dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3). However, the correct output is `1` because we can form a square (a regular polygon with 4 sides) using the four sticks of length 3.

In the fourth test case, the input is `9 4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`. The program would output `0` because it only considers the possibility of forming triangles. However, the correct output is `2` because we can form a pentagon (a regular polygon with 5 sides) using the four sticks of length 2 and a square (a regular polygon with 4 sides) using the four sticks of length 4.

To correctly solve the problem, the function `func_1` should consider all possible regular polygons that can be formed with the given sticks, not just triangles.

Correctness: **False**
