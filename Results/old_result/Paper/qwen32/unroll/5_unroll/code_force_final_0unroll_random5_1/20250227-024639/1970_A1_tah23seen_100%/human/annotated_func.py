#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and the values represent the cumulative balance of parentheses up to that position, starting from 0.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: s
    return ans
    #The program returns the variable 'ans'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string `ans` that represents the original string reordered based on the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each position.
