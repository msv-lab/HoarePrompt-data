The function reads an integer `t` from the input, then for each of the next `t` lines, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. It counts the number of '1's in the string `s` and prints 'YES' if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the count is exactly 0 or 1 and there are no consecutive '1's. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
