### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`). The key insight is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because the game mechanics ensure that each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by an odd number (either 1 or 3, depending on the position of the chosen coin). Therefore, if the initial count of `'U'` is odd, Alice can always make the last move, ensuring her victory.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of coins and the string representing the coins.
3. It counts the number of `'U'` in the string.
4. It prints `'YES'` if the count of `'U'` is odd, otherwise it prints `'NO'`.

The given execution state in the comments matches the expected behavior of the program. For example, with the input `5 UUDUD`, the count of `'U'` is 3, which is odd, so the program correctly outputs `'YES'`.
