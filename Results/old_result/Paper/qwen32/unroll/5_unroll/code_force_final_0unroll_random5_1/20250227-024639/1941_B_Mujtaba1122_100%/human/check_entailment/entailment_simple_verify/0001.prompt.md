You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The operation can be applied multiple times, and it involves decrementing three consecutive elements in a specific manner.

### Program Analysis
Let's look at the provided code:

#### Function 1: `func_1`
```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
`func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is not zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
`func_2` attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero. It iterates through the array from the second element to the second last element. For each element `i`, it tries to apply the operation as long as the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are met. The operation is supposed to decrement `list[i + 1]` by `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]` by `2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1]` by `list[i - 1]`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The operation logic inside the `while` loop is incorrect. The program is supposed to decrement `list[i + 1]` by `1`, `list[i]` by `2`, and `list[i - 1]` by `1`, not by `list[i - 1]`. This is a critical issue that affects the correctness of the solution.
2. **Early Termination**: The program checks if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the `while` loop and immediately prints 'no' and returns if it is not zero. This is incorrect because the operation might still be applicable to other elements, and the program should continue checking the rest of the array.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The problem statement allows for any case in the output ('YES' or 'NO'). The program prints 'no' in lowercase, which is not compliant with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect operation logic, early termination, and non-compliance with case sensitivity in the output.

Correctness: **False**
