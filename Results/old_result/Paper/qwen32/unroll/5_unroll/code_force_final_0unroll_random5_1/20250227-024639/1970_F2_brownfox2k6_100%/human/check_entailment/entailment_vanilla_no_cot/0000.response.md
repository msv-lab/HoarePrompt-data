Correctness: **False**

The provided code snippets are incomplete and do not cover all the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle the following aspects:

1. **Initialization of the game state**: The code does not initialize the positions of players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger based on the input.
2. **Processing of actions**: The code does not process the actions provided in the input, such as moving entities, catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, etc.
3. **Scoring**: The code does not handle scoring when the Quaffle is placed in a goal.
4. **Elimination of players**: The function `func_2` only checks for elimination by the Bludger, but it does not handle the actual movement or interaction of entities.
5. **Output**: The code does not print the required output format for scoring and elimination events, nor does it print the final score at the end of the game.

To be considered correct, the program needs to fully implement the logic described in the problem statement, including initializing the game state, processing each action, updating the game state accordingly, and printing the required output.
