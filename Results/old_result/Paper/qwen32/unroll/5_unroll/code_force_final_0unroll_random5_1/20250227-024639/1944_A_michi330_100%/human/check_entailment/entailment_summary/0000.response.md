### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. Initially, all islands are connected, and Everule can visit all `n` islands.

To minimize the number of islands Everule can visit, Dominater should aim to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1. The optimal strategy is to destroy bridges in such a way that the maximum number of islands are isolated from island 1.

- If `k` is at least `n - 1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. This is because to keep island 1 connected to any other island, there must be at least one bridge to each of the other `n-1` islands. Thus, destroying `n-1` bridges is sufficient to disconnect island 1 from all others, leaving only island 1 reachable.
  
- If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands. Therefore, Everule can still reach all `n` islands.

The given program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If true, it prints `1` because island 1 can be isolated.
- Otherwise, it prints `n` because Everule can still reach all islands.
