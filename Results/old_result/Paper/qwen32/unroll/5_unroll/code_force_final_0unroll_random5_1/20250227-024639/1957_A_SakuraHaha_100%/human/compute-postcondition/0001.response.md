The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The value of `n` is already given and represents the number of integers that will be read. Therefore, `a` will be a list of `n` integers.

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100).

After executing the code:
- `a` is assigned the list of `n` integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100).**
