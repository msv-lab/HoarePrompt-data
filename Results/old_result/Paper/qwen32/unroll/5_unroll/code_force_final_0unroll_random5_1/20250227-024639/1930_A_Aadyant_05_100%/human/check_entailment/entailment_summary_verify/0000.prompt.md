You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list, sums the elements at even indices, and prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it handles input. Specifically, the code reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then expects three inputs for each test case: the number of pairs (`s`), an empty line (which is not used), and the list of numbers. However, according to the problem description, there are only two inputs per test case: the number of pairs (`n`) and the list of numbers.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The code reads an extra input line (`a = input()`) which is not used. This line is intended to be the number of pairs (`n`), but it is not used correctly.
   - The actual list of numbers is read from `b = input()`, which is correct, but the previous unused input line causes the program to skip every other test case input.

2. **Looping Error**:
   - The loop `for num in range(int(n)):` is intended to iterate over each test case. However, due to the incorrect input handling, the loop will not work as intended because it will skip every other test case input.

To fix the program, we need to adjust the input reading logic to correctly handle the inputs as specified in the problem description. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list1.sort()
        s = sum(list1[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

func()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of pairs and the list of numbers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the minimums of each pair. This should work correctly for all test cases as described in the problem statement.
