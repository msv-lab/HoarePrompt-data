In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used inside the loop body. 

The variables `n`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_{ij}` are mentioned as part of the problem description but are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The state of `t` is the only thing we can adjust in the loop head to ensure the loop executes.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
