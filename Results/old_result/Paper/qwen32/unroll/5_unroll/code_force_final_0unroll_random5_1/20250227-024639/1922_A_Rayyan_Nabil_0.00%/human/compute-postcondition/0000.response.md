The code provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and the constraints on `t` remain the same. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
