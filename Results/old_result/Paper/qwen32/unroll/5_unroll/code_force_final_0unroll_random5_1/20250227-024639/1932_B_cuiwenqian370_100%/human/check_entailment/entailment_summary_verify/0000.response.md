Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every `a_i` years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred. The task is to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur using a specific formula. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's behavior:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign (from the second to the `n`-th sign), it calculates the `next_year` using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the `last_year` (which is the year the `n`-th sign occurs) to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results separated by newlines.

### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input, calculates the year in which all signs will next flash simultaneously, and writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.

### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment states that the program correctly calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. It provides a detailed explanation of how the program works and why it is correct, including handling edge cases.

### Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's verify the correctness of the formula used:
- The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is designed to find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`. This is correct because:
  - Adding `a[i] - 1` to `last_year + 1` ensures that the sum is at least `last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1`, which is `last_year + a[i]`.
  - The integer division by `a[i]` and subsequent multiplication by `a[i]` find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles all edge cases and correctly calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
