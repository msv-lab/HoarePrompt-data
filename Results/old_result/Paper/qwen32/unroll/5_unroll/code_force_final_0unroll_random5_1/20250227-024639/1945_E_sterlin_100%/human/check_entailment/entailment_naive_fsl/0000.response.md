Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not actually implement the logic required to solve the problem. The code only includes input reading functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) but does not contain any logic to perform the required operations of rearranging the permutation using at most two swaps and then performing the binary search to find the number `x`.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the permutation `n` and the number `x` to be found.
3. Read the permutation `p`.
4. Perform at most two swaps to rearrange the permutation such that a binary search can correctly find `x`.
5. Output the number of swaps performed and the indices of the elements swapped.
6. Perform the binary search to verify that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Since the provided code does not implement any of these steps, it is incorrect.
