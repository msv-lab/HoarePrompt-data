Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem description and the given examples.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the grid dimensions (N and M).
   - It then reads the grid and identifies the positions of players and goals.
   - The program keeps track of the positions of players in a dictionary and goals in a dictionary of lists.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - The program defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map movement commands to coordinate changes.
   - It correctly updates the positions of players based on the movement commands 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.

3. **Throwing the Quaffle:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`T` command), the program checks if the player is on a goal.
   - It awards points to the correct team based on whether the player is on a goal of the opposing team.
   - The program prints the event and updates the score accordingly.

4. **Final Score Output:**
   - After processing all moves, the program prints the final score.

However, there are some issues with the provided program:

- **Quaffle Reset:** The program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
- **Incorrect Goal Check:** The program checks if the player is on a goal using `if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:` and `if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:`. This is incorrect because it checks if the player's tuple is in the list of goal tuples, which will never be true since the player's position is updated after the goal is checked.
- **Missing Function Implementation:** The function `func_1` is used to update player positions, but it is not defined before its first use in the code. The provided execution summary indicates that `func_1` is defined correctly, but it should be defined before it is called.

Given these issues, the program does not fully adhere to the problem description. Specifically, it does not reset the Quaffle's position and does not correctly check if a player is on a goal.

Correctness: **False**
