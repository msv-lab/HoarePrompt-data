### Reasoning:

The program has a significant issue in the `func_1` function, where it attempts to use undefined variables `x` and `y`. The correct variables `x` and `y` should be extracted from the tuple `a` (which represents the initial position), and `dx` and `dy` should be extracted from the tuple `b` (which represents the movement direction). However, the function currently incorrectly assigns `b` to both `dx` and `dy`, and it does not properly define `x` and `y`.

Given the description of the function's intended behavior and the provided code, the function should actually look like this:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a  # Extract x and y from the initial position tuple
    dx, dy = b  # Extract dx and dy from the movement direction tuple
    return x + dx, y + dy
```

However, the given function incorrectly assigns `b` to both `dx` and `dy` and does not define `x` and `y` correctly, leading to a `NameError` when the function is called.

Additionally, there is a logical error in the `C` (catch) action handling. The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be an assignment (`quidditch[1] = mo[0]`), not a comparison.

Given these issues, the program will not execute correctly as intended.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program contains errors that would prevent it from running as expected, and the `func_1` function is incorrectly implemented.
