Let's analyze the problem and the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shift**: The x-th cyclic shift of an array `a` is `a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{x-1}`.
3. **Task**: Find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= t <= 1000` (number of test cases).
   - `1 <= k <= n <= 1000` (length of the array and number of sorted cyclic shifts).
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `1000`.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. **For `k >= 2`**:
   - If `n == k`, it outputs an array consisting of `k` repeated elements, all equal to `k`.
     - **Example**: For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `2 2`. The cyclic shifts are `[2, 2]` and `[2, 2]`, both sorted.
   - If `n != k`, it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `n != k` and `k >= 2`.
2. **For `k < 2`** (i.e., `k == 1`):
   - It outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - **Example**: For `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the output is `1 2 3`. The cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`. Only `[1, 2, 3]` is sorted.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - The program outputs `2 2`.
  - The cyclic shifts are `[2, 2]` and `[2, 2]`, both sorted.
  - This satisfies the condition.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `k = 1`
  - The program outputs `1 2 3`.
  - The cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`. Only `[1, 2, 3]` is sorted.
  - This satisfies the condition.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
  - The program outputs `-1`.
  - It's impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts when `n = 3`.
  - This satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
