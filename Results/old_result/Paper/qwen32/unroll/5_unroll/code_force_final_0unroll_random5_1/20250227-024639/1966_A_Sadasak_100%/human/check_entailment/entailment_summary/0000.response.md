Reasoning: 
The provided Python program is incorrect based on the problem description. The core issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. The current implementation of `func_1` and the logic in the main loop do not correctly account for the optimal strategy to minimize the number of cards.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` creates a frequency table where each number's count is capped at `k`. However, this does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. The goal is to reduce the number of cards by replacing groups of `k` cards with `k-1` cards, which can be done for any number that appears at least `k` times.

2. **Logic for Determining Minimum Cards:** The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table, which is not the correct approach. It should instead calculate how many cards can be reduced based on the frequency of each number and the value of `k`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:** The program does not correctly handle scenarios where multiple numbers can be reduced simultaneously or where the number of cards is less than `k`.

A correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the frequency of each card.
- For each number that appears at least `k` times, determine how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed and replace them with `k-1` cards.
- Sum the remaining cards after all possible replacements.

Correctness: **False**
