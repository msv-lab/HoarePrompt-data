You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` (where `3 <= n <= len(list)`). It modifies the list by reducing certain elements based on specific conditions. If any element at position `i - 1` is not zero after the modifications, it prints 'no' and returns. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' if `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, or 'NO' if `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2` for Modifying the Array:**
   - The operation described in the problem is to subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`. However, the code incorrectly modifies the array elements in a different way:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     This approach does not match the described operation and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Check in `func_2`:**
   - The code checks `if list[i - 1] != 0` after the while loop, but this doesn't ensure that the entire array can be made zero. It should ensure that all elements in the array are zero after the operations are applied.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where the array cannot be made zero due to the constraints of the operations. For example, if the array has an odd number of non-zero elements that cannot be balanced by the operations, the code should return "NO".

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The code prints "YES" or "NO" directly within the function, which is not suitable if the function is intended to return these values for further processing or testing.

To correct the program, the logic for modifying the array should be adjusted to match the problem description, and a proper check should be implemented to ensure all elements are zero after the operations. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    # Check if the sum of all elements is divisible by 3
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    if total_sum % 3 != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    # Check if we can make all elements zero
    carry = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        arr[i] += carry
        if arr[i] % 3 != 0:
            return "NO"
        carry = arr[i] // 3 * 2
    
    arr[n - 1] += carry
    if arr[n - 1] % 3 != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    return "YES"

def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        results.append(can_make_zero(arr, n))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected version checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and then simulates the operations to ensure all elements can be made zero. If any element cannot be balanced, it returns "NO".
