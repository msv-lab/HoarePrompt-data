Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key point is that the sum of water across all containers is divisible by the number of containers, meaning there is a target amount of water each container should hold to be equalized.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution seems to have an incorrect logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The code calculates the difference between each element and the last element and sums these differences. This does not accurately determine if the water can be evenly distributed among all containers.
   - The check `if curr == 0` is not a valid condition to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total water divided by the number of containers.
   - Check if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has the target amount. This can be done by ensuring that at no point in the redistribution process do we need to pour water from a container that already has less water than the target amount.

### Correct Solution Logic:
1. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have.
2. Use a prefix sum approach to check if it's possible to redistribute the water:
   - Keep a running total of the water in the containers.
   - At each step, check if the running total is sufficient to fill the containers up to the target amount.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        curr = 0
        can_distribute = True
        for i in nums:
            curr += i
            if curr < target * (i + 1):
                can_distribute = False
                break
        if can_distribute:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
