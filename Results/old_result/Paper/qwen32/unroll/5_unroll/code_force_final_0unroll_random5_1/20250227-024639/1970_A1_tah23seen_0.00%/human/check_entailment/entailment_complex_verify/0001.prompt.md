You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where each key from `1` to `n` maps to the depth of nested parentheses at that position, with `d[n]` being `0`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is the same as `s`; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of nested parentheses.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which is the same as the string `s`, a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and guarantees it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns the same string `s` unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to see if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input string `n` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - This function is supposed to compute the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balances at each position.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `s` to compute the prefix balance:
     - If the character is `(`, it increases the prefix balance by 1.
     - If the character is `)`, it decreases the prefix balance by 1.
   - The dictionary `d` maps positions (1-based) to their corresponding prefix balances.
   - The program then removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` (which corresponds to the total balance of the sequence, and should be 0 for a balanced sequence).
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the prefix balance in increasing order. In case of ties, the positions are sorted in decreasing order (though the provided code does not explicitly handle this tie-breaking condition).
   - Finally, the program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from the original string `s` in the order determined by the sorted positions.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The sorting step is crucial. The code sorts the dictionary based on the prefix balance, but it does not specify a secondary sort by position in decreasing order when prefix balances are equal. However, the problem statement specifies that ties should be broken by position in decreasing order. The provided code does not implement this tie-breaking condition, which may lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

4. **Generating Output:**
   - The characters from the original string are appended to the result string `ans` in the order determined by the sorted positions.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly computes the prefix balances and sorts them.
- However, it does not handle the tie-breaking condition specified in the problem statement (sorting by position in decreasing order when prefix balances are equal). This can lead to incorrect results for some inputs.

### Conclusion:
Due to the missing tie-breaking condition, the program does not guarantee the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
