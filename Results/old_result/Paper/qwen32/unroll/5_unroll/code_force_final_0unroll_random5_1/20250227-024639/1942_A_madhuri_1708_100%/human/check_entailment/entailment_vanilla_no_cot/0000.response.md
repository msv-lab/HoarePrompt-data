Let's analyze the given program and compare it to the problem requirements:

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n-1} \leq a_n \).
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: The \( x \)-th cyclic shift of an array \( a \) is defined as \( a_x, a_{x+1}, \ldots, a_n, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{x-1} \).
3. **Objective**: Find an array \( a \) of length \( n \) such that exactly \( k \) of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 \)
   - \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)
   - If no such array exists, output \(-1\).

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program handles two main cases based on the value of \( k \):

1. **Case 1: \( k \geq 2 \)**
   - If \( k = n \): The program outputs an array where all elements are equal to \( k \). This ensures that all cyclic shifts are identical and sorted.
   - If \( k < n \): The program outputs \(-1\), implying that it cannot find an array with exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts when \( k \geq 2 \) and \( k < n \).

2. **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**
   - The program outputs an array where elements are in strictly increasing order from 1 to \( n \). Only the first cyclic shift (the array itself) will be sorted, which satisfies \( k = 1 \).

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case 1: \( k \geq 2 \) and \( k = n \)**: This part is correct. An array with all elements equal will indeed have all its cyclic shifts sorted.
- **Case 1: \( k \geq 2 \) and \( k < n \)**: This part is incorrect. There can be arrays with exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts even when \( k < n \). For example, for \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), the array \( [1, 2, 4, 3] \) has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: \([1, 2, 4, 3]\) and \([3, 1, 2, 4]\).
- **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**: This part is correct. An array in strictly increasing order will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the case when \( k \geq 2 \) and \( k < n \). Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
