### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided code's logic. The given program checks if `n >= m` to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, which is not sufficient. The key issue is that the remaining moves after reaching `m` cubes must be used in pairs of "add-then-remove" or "remove-then-add" operations, which means `n - m` must be even.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It prints "Yes" if `n >= m` and "No" otherwise.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not account for the need to use the remaining moves in pairs.

2. **Counterexamples**:
   - **Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 0`
     - Expected: "Yes" (Nikita can add and then remove a cube, and do nothing in the third move)
     - Actual: "No" (Incorrect because `n` is greater than `m`, but the program outputs "No")
   - **Case 2**: `n = 1`, `m = 2`
     - Expected: "No" (Nikita can only add one cube, so it's impossible to have 2 cubes)
     - Actual: "No" (Correct)
   - **Case 3**: `n = 2`, `m = 1`
     - Expected: "Yes" (Nikita can add one cube and do nothing in the second move)
     - Actual: "Yes" (Correct)

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should be: `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
   - This ensures that there are enough moves to reach `m` cubes and that the remaining moves can be used in pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the logic. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `n - m` is odd. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
