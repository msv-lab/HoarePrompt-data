Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Analysis:

#### Functions Provided:
1. **func_1(obj, d)**: This function is responsible for moving an object (`obj`) in a specified direction (`d`). The object is expected to be a list of two integers representing its coordinates on the field. The directions 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right) are supported.
   
2. **func_2(t)**: This function checks for eliminations caused by the Bludger. It iterates through all players and checks if they are in the same position as the Bludger (`blud`). If a player is found in the same position as the Bludger, they are marked as eliminated by setting their position to `[-1, -1]` and added to the output list `out`. After checking all players, it prints the elimination events in alphabetical order of the player identifiers.

### Issues and Missing Components:
1. **Initialization and Data Structures**:
   - The program does not define the necessary data structures such as `player` and `blud`.
   - There is no initialization of the field or parsing of the input.

2. **Handling Actions**:
   - The program does not parse or handle the actions provided for each step.
   - There is no logic to handle the actions 'C' (catch the ball) and 'T' (throw the Quaffle).

3. **Scoring and Output**:
   - The program does not keep track of the score or print the scoring events.
   - There is no final score output at the end of the game.

4. **Elimination Handling**:
   - The elimination function (`func_2`) only checks for eliminations at a specific time `t` and does not integrate with the main game loop.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions are incomplete and do not cover the full scope of the problem requirements. The program lacks essential components such as input parsing, handling all types of actions, keeping track of the score, and producing the required output. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
