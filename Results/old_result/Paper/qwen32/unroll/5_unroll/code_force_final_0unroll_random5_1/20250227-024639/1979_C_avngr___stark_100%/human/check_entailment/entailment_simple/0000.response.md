Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by finding a suitable distribution of bets for each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Let's break down the logic and verify if the program correctly implements this solution.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The function `func_2` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers in the list `k`. This is done by iteratively applying the function `func_1`, which computes the LCM of two numbers using the formula `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - The LCM of the multipliers is stored in the variable `m`.

3. **Calculating Bets:**
   - The program calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM `m` by the corresponding multiplier `k[i]` and storing the result in the list `c`.
   - If the sum of the bets in `c` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets in `c`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The goal is to ensure that the total amount of coins bet (`sum(c)`) is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome (`k[i] * c[i]`).
   - Since `c[i] = m // k[i]`, the amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k[i] * (m // k[i]) = m`. Therefore, the condition `sum(c) < m` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

The logic appears correct, and the program should work as intended for the given problem constraints. However, there is a subtle issue: the condition `sum(c) >= m` should be `sum(c) >= m` to correctly identify cases where no valid distribution exists. But since the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that satisfies the constraints, the implementation provided should work correctly for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
