### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of containers and the amount of water in each container. The sum of water in each test case is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. For each test case, it calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water per container (`mean`).
2. It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running total (`curr`) that represents the net amount of water that needs to be moved from the current and previous containers to the next ones to achieve the desired equal distribution.
3. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that more water has been moved out than can be compensated by the remaining containers, and the function returns "NO".
4. If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns "YES", indicating that it is possible to equalize the water in all containers.

The logic is correct because:
- The condition `curr < 0` ensures that we do not attempt to move water from a container that does not have enough water to give, considering the previous operations.
- Since the sum of water is divisible by the number of containers, there exists a way to distribute the water equally if and only if we can always move water from the current and previous containers to the next ones without running out of water.
