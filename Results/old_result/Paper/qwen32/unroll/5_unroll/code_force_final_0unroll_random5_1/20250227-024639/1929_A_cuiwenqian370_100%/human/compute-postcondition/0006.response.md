To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the operations performed within the loop and how they affect the variables. Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`.
2. In each iteration:
   - The variable `n` is set to the integer value of the string at `data[index]`.
   - The `index` is incremented by 1.
   - The `array` is updated to a list of integers derived from the next `n` strings in `data`, starting from `data[index]`.
   - The `index` is incremented by `n`.
   - The function `func_1(array)` is called with the updated `array`, and the result is appended to the `results` list.

The loop modifies the `array`, `index`, and `results` variables, but the `data` and `t` variables remain unchanged. After the loop finishes, the `array` will be the last array processed in the final iteration, `index` will be the position after the last processed part of `data`, and `results` will contain the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`array` is the last array processed in the final iteration of the loop; `data` remains unchanged; `t` remains unchanged; `index` is the position after the last processed part of `data`; `results` contains the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration.**
