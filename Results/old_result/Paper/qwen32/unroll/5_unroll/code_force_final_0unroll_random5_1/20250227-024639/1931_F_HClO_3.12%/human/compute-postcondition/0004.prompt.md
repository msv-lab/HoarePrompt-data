You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each screenshot description is a list of n distinct integers a_{ij} where 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, and a_{i0} (the first element of each list) is the author of the screenshot. All authors of the screenshots in a test case are different.

    #State: For each test case, the program will print either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a_{ij}`, and the lists `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val` will be in their final states after processing all inputs for that test case. The specific values of these variables will depend on the input provided, but they will not affect the output beyond the current test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` distinct integers where the first integer in the list is the author of the screenshot. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided integers and list.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
