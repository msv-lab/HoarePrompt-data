The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `data`, `input`, `index`, or `T`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a number from the input; `input` holds the entire input as provided; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
