Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine if a given integer array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly replacing elements that are at least 10 with their digits. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly implement the problem's requirements.

The main issue with the program lies in the loop that checks whether the array can be sorted:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
```
This loop checks if the current element is smaller than the previous one. If it is, it tries to split the previous element into its digits and append the current element to it. However, this does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem, which allows us to replace any element that is at least 10 with its digits, not just the previous element when the current element is smaller.

Moreover, the logic `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` is incorrect because it only replaces the previous element with the first digit of the split number, which does not reflect the correct transformation of the array as described in the problem statement.

A correct approach would involve checking if the array can be sorted by simulating the operation on any element that is at least 10 and checking if the resulting array can be sorted. This would likely involve more complex logic, such as using a recursive or iterative approach to explore all possible transformations of the array.

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
