Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program does not actually compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. Instead, it has hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array `c` (which is supposed to be the length of the input array `a`), without considering the actual values in the array.

- For an array of length 2, it outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which means it assumes the array can be transformed into `[2, 2]` with one operation, regardless of the initial values of the array.
- For any other length, it outputs `13 0`, which means it assumes the initial sum of the array is the maximum possible sum and no operations are needed.

This behavior is incorrect because:
1. The MEX operation depends on the actual values in the subarray, not just the length of the array.
2. The program does not consider the possibility of performing multiple operations to maximize the sum.
3. The hardcoded outputs do not match the problem's requirements for different input scenarios.

Therefore, the program does not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array based on the MEX operation.

Correctness: **False**
