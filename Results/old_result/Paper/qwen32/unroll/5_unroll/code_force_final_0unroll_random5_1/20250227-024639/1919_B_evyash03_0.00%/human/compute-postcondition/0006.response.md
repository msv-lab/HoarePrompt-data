Functionality: **The function evaluates a string `expression` consisting of '+' and '-' characters, and returns the sum of the number of times the cumulative balance (starting at 0, incremented by 1 for each '+', decremented by 1 for each '-') went negative and was reset to 0, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0.**
