Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Union-Find Implementation**: The `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) class is not defined in the provided code. Without this class, the union-find operations in `func_6` will not work, leading to undefined behavior.

2. **Graph and Variables Scope Issues**: The `graph` and `node_v` variables used in `dfs` are not defined in the scope of that function. They should be passed as arguments or defined globally, but they are not.

3. **DFS Logic**: The DFS function `dfs` is supposed to find a cycle starting from `node_u` and ending at `node_v`. However, the logic to find the cycle is flawed. The condition `if res and node_v in set_res` is not sufficient to ensure that the cycle is correctly identified and returned. The function should ensure that the path forms a cycle and includes both `node_u` and `node_v`.

4. **Edge Weight Handling**: The code sorts edges in descending order and then processes them. However, the logic to find the minimum weight edge in a cycle is incorrect. The code should aim to find a cycle with the minimum weight edge, not just the first cycle it finds with a lighter edge.

5. **Output Format**: The output format might not match the expected format in all cases. The code should ensure that the cycle vertices are printed in the correct order.

To correct these issues, the `DSU` class should be defined, the `graph` and `node_v` variables should be properly scoped, the DFS logic should be corrected to ensure it finds the correct cycle, and the edge weight handling should be adjusted to find the correct cycle with the minimum weight edge.
