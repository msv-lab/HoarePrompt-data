You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Union-Find Implementation**: The `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) class is not defined in the provided code. Without this class, the union-find operations in `func_6` will not work, leading to undefined behavior.

2. **Graph and Variables Scope Issues**: The `graph` and `node_v` variables used in `dfs` are not defined in the scope of that function. They should be passed as arguments or defined globally, but they are not.

3. **DFS Logic**: The DFS function `dfs` is supposed to find a cycle starting from `node_u` and ending at `node_v`. However, the logic to find the cycle is flawed. The condition `if res and node_v in set_res` is not sufficient to ensure that the cycle is correctly identified and returned. The function should ensure that the path forms a cycle and includes both `node_u` and `node_v`.

4. **Edge Weight Handling**: The code sorts edges in descending order and then processes them. However, the logic to find the minimum weight edge in a cycle is incorrect. The code should aim to find a cycle with the minimum weight edge, not just the first cycle it finds with a lighter edge.

5. **Output Format**: The output format might not match the expected format in all cases. The code should ensure that the cycle vertices are printed in the correct order.

To correct these issues, the `DSU` class should be defined, the `graph` and `node_v` variables should be properly scoped, the DFS logic should be corrected to ensure it finds the correct cycle, and the edge weight handling should be adjusted to find the correct cycle with the minimum weight edge.
