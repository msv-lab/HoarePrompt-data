Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Initialization of `soma` inside the loop**: The variable `soma` is initialized outside the loop that processes each test case, but it is not reset for each new test case. This means that the sum from previous test cases will carry over to the next one, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect loop range**: The inner loop `for i in range(n):` should start from 1 to `n` inclusive, but it currently starts from 0 to `n-1`. This means that it is not including `n` in the sum, which is required by the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_1` usage**: The function `func_1` is called with `i` inside the loop, but it should be called with `i + 1` to correctly process numbers from 1 to `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    soma = 0  # Reset soma for each test case
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Include n in the range
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This corrected version initializes `soma` inside the loop for each test case, iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive, and correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number.
