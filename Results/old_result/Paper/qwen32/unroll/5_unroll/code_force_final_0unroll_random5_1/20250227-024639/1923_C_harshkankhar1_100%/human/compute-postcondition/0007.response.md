Output State: **The output state consists of `t` test cases, each with `n` integers in array `c`, `q` queries defined by pairs `(l_i, r_i)`, and the lists `a` and `b` computed as described. After executing the loop, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query, based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
