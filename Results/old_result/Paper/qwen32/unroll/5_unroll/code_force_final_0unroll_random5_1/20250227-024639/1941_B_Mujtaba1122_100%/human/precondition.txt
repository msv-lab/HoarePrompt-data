list is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the elements of the array for each test case, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The first element of the main list is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
