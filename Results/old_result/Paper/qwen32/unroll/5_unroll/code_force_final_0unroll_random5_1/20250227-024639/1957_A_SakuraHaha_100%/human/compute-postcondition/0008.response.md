To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the value of `ans` based on the given initial state.

### Understanding the Initial State:
1. **`cnt`**: This is a dictionary where the values are integers. The exact contents of `cnt` are not provided, but we know that `cnt.values()` will give us a list of these integer values.
2. **`ans`**: This variable is calculated as the sum of `x // 3` for each `x` in `cnt.values()`. This means for each value `x` in the dictionary `cnt`, we perform integer division of `x` by 3 and then sum all these results.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- For each value `x` in `cnt.values()`, compute `x // 3`.
- Sum all these computed values to get `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
If `cnt` was `{1: 6, 2: 9, 3: 12}`, then:
- For `x = 6`, `6 // 3 = 2`
- For `x = 9`, `9 // 3 = 3`
- For `x = 12`, `12 // 3 = 4`
- Summing these results: `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`
- Therefore, `ans` would be `9`.

### General Description:
Since the exact contents of `cnt` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe `ans` as the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt.values()` by 3.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for each x in cnt.values())**
