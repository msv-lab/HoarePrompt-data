You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case, depending on whether the condition `curr == 0` is satisfied for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if a specific condition is met (related to the sum of the elements in the list relative to the last element) and prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key point is that the sum of water across all containers is divisible by the number of containers, meaning there is a target amount of water each container should hold to be equalized.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution seems to have an incorrect logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The code calculates the difference between each element and the last element and sums these differences. This does not accurately determine if the water can be evenly distributed among all containers.
   - The check `if curr == 0` is not a valid condition to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total water divided by the number of containers.
   - Check if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has the target amount. This can be done by ensuring that at no point in the redistribution process do we need to pour water from a container that already has less water than the target amount.

### Correct Solution Logic:
1. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have.
2. Use a prefix sum approach to check if it's possible to redistribute the water:
   - Keep a running total of the water in the containers.
   - At each step, check if the running total is sufficient to fill the containers up to the target amount.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        curr = 0
        can_distribute = True
        for i in nums:
            curr += i
            if curr < target * (i + 1):
                can_distribute = False
                break
        if can_distribute:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
