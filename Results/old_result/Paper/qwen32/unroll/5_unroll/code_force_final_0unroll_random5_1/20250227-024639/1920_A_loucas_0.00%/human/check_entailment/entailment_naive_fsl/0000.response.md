Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is that the code does not count the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints. Instead, it attempts to find a single integer `k` that satisfies the constraints and prints it. If no such integer is found, it prints `num` which is not initialized properly and may result in an incorrect or undefined output.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Output Handling**: The code is supposed to output the count of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, but it instead tries to find and print a single integer `k` that satisfies the constraints. If no such integer is found, it prints `num`, which is not initialized properly and may result in incorrect or undefined output.

2. **Loop and Condition Logic**: The loop `for i in range(max(big), min(less)):` only checks if there is a single integer `k` that satisfies the constraints. It does not count the number of such integers. Additionally, it only breaks the loop after finding the first valid integer, which is not the required behavior.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where there are no integers that satisfy all constraints. It should output `0` in such cases, but the current logic may not handle this correctly.

To fix the code, it should count the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints and print that count for each test case. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = float('inf')
        big = float('-inf')
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big = max(big, a)
            elif x == 2:
                less = min(less, a)
            else:
                no.add(a)
        count = 0
        for i in range(big, less + 1):
            if i not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version:
- `less` is initialized to `float('inf')` and `big` to `float('-inf')` to ensure that the minimum and maximum constraints are correctly captured.
- `no` is a set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.
- A loop iterates from `big` to `less` (inclusive) and counts the number of integers that are not in the `no` set.
- The count is then printed for each test case.
