The code snippet `st = set()` initializes the variable `st` to be an empty set. This means that any previous value `st` held is replaced with an empty set. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains the return value of `func_1()`, `k` remains the return value of `func_1()`, `arr` remains the return value of `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first element in `arr` that matches `k`, or `-1` if no match is found, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.**
