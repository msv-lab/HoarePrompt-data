To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the given code and its behavior for each test case.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `T` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `S` is the number of integers.
   - `N` is a list of `S` integers, each between 0 and `S-1`.

2. **Sorting and Processing:**
   - The list `N` is sorted.
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number in `N`.

3. **Updating `cur`:**
   - The code iterates through the sorted list `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
       - If `num` is more than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks.
       - Otherwise, `cur` is set to `num`, and `M[num]` is set to 1.
     - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, the count for `cur` in `M` is incremented.
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determining `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is a list of keys from `M` where the count is exactly 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is set to the second smallest value in `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - The value of `cur` is printed for each test case.

The output state after all iterations will be the final values of `cur` for each test case. Since the state of `T`, `t`, and the input values for each test case remain unchanged outside the loop, the only changing state is the value of `cur` for each test case.

Output State: **The final value of `cur` for each test case, printed sequentially.**
