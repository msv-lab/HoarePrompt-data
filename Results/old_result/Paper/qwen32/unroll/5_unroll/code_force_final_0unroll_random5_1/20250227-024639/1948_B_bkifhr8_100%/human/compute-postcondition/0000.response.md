The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer input and assigning it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `t` and `a` are not affected by this line of code. The variable `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; n is the integer value provided by the input; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.**
