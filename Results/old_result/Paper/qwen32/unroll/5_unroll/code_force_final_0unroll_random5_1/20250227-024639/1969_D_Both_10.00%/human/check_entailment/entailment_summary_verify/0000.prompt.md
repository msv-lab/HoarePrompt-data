You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    4 1

    4 2 3 2
    
    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    0

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers. It calculates a sum by adding the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and then adds the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` if their sum is non-negative. The function returns the calculated sum, which is always 94 in this case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The given code is incomplete and does not handle the logic required to determine Alice's optimal profit. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Functions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` rely on a non-defined function `putin()`, which should presumably be `input()`. However, these functions are not used in the main logic of the program.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic for calculating Alice's profit. It simply sums up the values from `sec_arr` and adds a conditional sum from `main_ar` based on a condition that does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

3. **Lack of Test Case Handling**: The code does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It does not iterate over the number of test cases `t` and process each test case accordingly.

4. **Optimization Strategy**: The code does not use an optimal strategy to maximize Alice's profit. It should consider sorting the items based on the difference between Bob's and Alice's prices and then apply the rules for selecting and selling items.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
def main():
    import sys
    import heapq
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        b = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        items = [(a[i], b[i], b[i] - a[i]) for i in range(n)]
        items.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
        
        profit = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i < k:
                profit -= a[i]
            else:
                profit += max(0, b[i] - a[i])
        
        results.append(profit)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version reads input, processes each test case, and calculates Alice's profit by sorting items based on the difference between Bob's and Alice's prices and applying the rules described in the problem statement.
