Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases)
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` (number of yogurts to buy)
   - `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30` (price of one yogurt and two yogurts respectively)

### Logic for Solution

To find the minimum cost:
- Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `n * a`
- Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs (with possible leftovers): 
  - Number of pairs: `n // 2`
  - Cost of pairs: `number_of_pairs * b`
  - Cost of leftover yogurt (if any): `(n % 2) * a`
  - Total cost for pairs: `number_of_pairs * b + (n % 2) * a`
- Compare the two costs and choose the minimum.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Misinterpretation of Input Variables**:
   - The program reads `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, but `c` is not used correctly. Instead, `b` should be the promotional price for two yogurts.
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. It seems like an attempt to calculate the average price per yogurt, but this is incorrect for the problem's logic.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. It seems to be comparing the cost of buying `b` yogurts individually with the cost of buying `d` yogurts individually, which does not make sense.
   - The `else` block `print(round(a * d))` is also incorrect. It seems to be attempting to print the cost of buying `d` yogurts individually, which is not the intended logic.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs (with possible leftovers)
        number_of_pairs = n // 2
        number_of_leftovers = n % 2
        cost_pairs = number_of_pairs * b + number_of_leftovers * a
        # Minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_pairs))

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of input variables and incorrect logic. 

Correctness: **False**
