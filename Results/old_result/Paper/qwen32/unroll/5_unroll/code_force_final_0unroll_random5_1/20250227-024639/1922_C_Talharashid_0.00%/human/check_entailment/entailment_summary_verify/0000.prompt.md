You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city coordinates and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum distance from one city to the closest other city, excluding a specified city.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description requirements.

### Analysis of the Program

The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of cities on a number line, and a set of queries. For each query, it needs to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another, where traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin, and traveling to any other city costs the absolute difference in their positions.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Reading Inputs:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities, their positions, the number of queries, and the queries themselves.

2. **Finding Closest Cities:**
   - The program calculates the cost to travel from each city to the closest city in two directions (left to right and right to left).
   - It uses dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store these costs.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it determines the minimum cost to travel from the start city to the end city by considering both possible paths (using the precomputed closest city costs).

### Potential Issues

1. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation in the while loops seems incorrect. The variable `mini` is set to a large number, and it should be updated to the minimum distance to the next or previous city. However, the logic to update `s` (the cost) is flawed. It should increment `s` by 1 when moving to the closest city, but the current logic adds the actual distance instead.
   
2. **Handling of Queries:**
   - The logic to determine the minimum cost for each query seems correct in principle, but it relies on the correct precomputed costs, which are not computed accurately due to the issues mentioned above.

### Example Where the Program Fails

Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce the expected output because of the incorrect cost calculation logic.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the cost to travel to the closest city. This affects the final cost calculations for each query.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of Why the Code is Incorrect

- The cost calculation logic in the while loops is incorrect. The program should increment the cost by 1 when moving to the closest city, not by the actual distance between cities.
- This incorrect cost calculation leads to incorrect results for the queries, making the entire program incorrect.
