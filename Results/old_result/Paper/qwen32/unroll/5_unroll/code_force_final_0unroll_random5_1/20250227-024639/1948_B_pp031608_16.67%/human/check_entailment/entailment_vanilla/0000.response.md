Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The task is to determine whether a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the list `n` and the list of integers `list1`.

2. **Logic for Splitting Elements:**
   - The program iterates over the list starting from the second element (`for p in range(1, len(list1))`).
   - It checks if the list is already sorted using the function `func_1(list1)`. If the list is already sorted, it does not attempt any operations.
   - If the list is not sorted and the current element is greater than the previous element (`list1[p - 1] > list1[p]`), and the previous element is at least 10 (`list1[p - 1] > 10`), it attempts to split the previous element.
   - The splitting operation is performed by removing the element at `p-1` and inserting its digits at that position.

3. **Splitting Operation:**
   - The program uses integer division (`a // 10`) and modulus (`a % 10`) to split the number into its tens and units digits.
   - However, this approach only handles two-digit numbers and does not correctly handle numbers with more than two digits.

4. **Checking Sortedness:**
   - After attempting to split elements, the program checks if the list is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.
   - If the list is sorted, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:** The program only handles two-digit numbers. For numbers with more than two digits, it will not correctly split them.
- **Inefficient Sortedness Check:** The program checks if the list is sorted at every step, which is unnecessary and inefficient.
- **Logical Flow:** The program attempts to fix the list by splitting elements only once per iteration, but it does not ensure that the list is fully sorted after all possible splits.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program is not correct for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
