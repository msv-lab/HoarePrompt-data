You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99) and a is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99) and b is odd. The field is a 2D grid of size a x b, where each cell contains either ".." (empty cell), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG" or "BG" (goals), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). There are between 1 and 5 goals for each team, exactly one Quaffle, and at most one Bludger. There are P players for each team (1 ≤ P ≤ 10). The next input is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, followed by T lines, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. Each action is a pair of characters followed by a space and a move (U, D, L, R) or a catch/throw action (C .Q for catching the Quaffle, T for throwing the Quaffle).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x + dx, y + dy, where dx is equal to b and dy is equal to b. Since x and y are not defined, a NameError would occur.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99) and `a` is odd, and `b` is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99) and `b` is odd. The function returns `x + dx, y + dy`, where `dx` is equal to `b` and `dy` is equal to `b`. However, since `x` and `y` are not defined within the function, this would result in a NameError.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns x + dx, y + dy, where dx is equal to b and dy is equal to b. Since x and y are not defined, a NameError would occur.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
