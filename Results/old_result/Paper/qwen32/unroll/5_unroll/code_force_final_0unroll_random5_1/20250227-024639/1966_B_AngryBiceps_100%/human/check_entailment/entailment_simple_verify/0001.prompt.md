You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `t` indicates the number of test cases processed, and for each test case, the grid properties are evaluated to determine if the output is 'YES' or 'NO'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reused for each test case without retaining their values from previous iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color. The goal is to determine if all squares can be made the same color after performing any number of such operations.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Color Rows and Columns**: If the first and last rows (or columns) of the grid are both single-colored (i.e., all squares in the row or column are the same color), and the colors of these rows (or columns) are different, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the operation can only change the color of squares within the subrectangle defined by the selected squares, and it cannot cross the boundary of different single-colored rows or columns.

2. **General Case**: If the grid does not meet the above condition, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because we can always use the operation to expand the single-colored regions until the entire grid is of the same color.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution checks the following conditions:
- If the first and last rows are both single-colored and have different colors, it prints "NO".
- If the first and last columns are both single-colored and have different colors, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness of the Solution:
The solution correctly implements the key observations. If the first and last rows (or columns) are both single-colored and have different colors, it is indeed impossible to make the entire grid the same color, and the solution correctly returns "NO". In all other cases, it correctly returns "YES".

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct based on the problem description and the key observations derived from it.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
