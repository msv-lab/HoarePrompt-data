Given the initial state, we have:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first few elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and the rest are zeros
- `k` is 0

The code snippet provided is:
```python
nums[0] += k
```

Since `k` is 0, adding `k` to `nums[0]` does not change the value of `nums[0]`. Therefore, the first element of `nums` remains the same, and all other elements of `nums` remain zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first few elements are `min(nums[0], 0)` and the rest are zeros.** 

In simpler terms, the first element of `nums` remains unchanged, and all other elements remain zeros, with `k` still being 0.
