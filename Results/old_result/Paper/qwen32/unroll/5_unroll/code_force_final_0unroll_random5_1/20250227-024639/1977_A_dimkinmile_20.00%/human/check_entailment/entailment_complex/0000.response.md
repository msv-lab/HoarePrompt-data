Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. It simply checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This logic does not correctly account for the possibility of removing cubes from the tower.

For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the program will print "Yes" because `n >= m`, but this is not necessarily correct. Nikita could start with no cubes, add 3 cubes, then remove 2 cubes, ending up with 1 cube, which is not equal to `m`. However, in this specific case, it is possible to end up with 3 cubes by adding 3 cubes and then not removing any, so the output "Yes" is correct for this example. 

The critical flaw is in the second example where `n = 2` and `m = 4`. The program will print "No" because `n < m`, but this is incorrect. Nikita cannot end up with 4 cubes after only 2 moves because the maximum number of cubes he can add is 2.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and if `n` is at least `m`. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, so to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even (as each pair of moves can add and then remove a cube, leaving the count unchanged except for the final count).

The correct condition should be: `if (n >= m) and ((n - m) % 2 == 0)`. 

Given the current implementation, the program does not account for the possibility of ending up with a specific number of cubes correctly, especially when the number of moves is less than the number of cubes required.

Correctness: **False**
