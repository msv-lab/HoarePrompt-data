You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin letters present in the strings of `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.`
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` which is formed by mapping each character in each string of `encoded` using `char_map`. Each character in the original strings of `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order as defined in `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a list of strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string `decoded` formed by mapping each character in each string of `encoded` to its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order as defined in `char_map`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `decoded` which is formed by mapping each character in each string of `encoded` using `char_map`. Each character in the original strings of `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order as defined in `char_map`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
