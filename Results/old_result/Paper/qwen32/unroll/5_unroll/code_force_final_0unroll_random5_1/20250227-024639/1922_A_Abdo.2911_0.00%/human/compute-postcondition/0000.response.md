The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and additional variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are described but not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` will change to whatever integer is input, but the other variables will remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
