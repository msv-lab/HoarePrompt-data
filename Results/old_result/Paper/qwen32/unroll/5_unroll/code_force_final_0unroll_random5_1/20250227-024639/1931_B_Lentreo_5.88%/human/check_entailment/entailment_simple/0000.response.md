### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine whether it is possible to make all the containers have the same amount of water using the given operation. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not correctly determine the possibility of equalizing the water in all containers.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Logic for Equalizing Water**:
   - The program selects the last element of the list `nums` and stores it in `last`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each element `i` in `nums`. If `i` is not 0, it adds the difference `i - last` to `curr`.
   - Finally, it checks if `curr` is 0. If it is, the program prints "YES", otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic is incorrect because it does not properly account for the possibility of redistributing water among the containers. The key insight for solving this problem is that it is always possible to equalize the water in all containers if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, which is guaranteed by the problem statement. The operation allows water to be transferred from any earlier container to any later container, which means that we can always redistribute the water to achieve the desired state.

### Correctness:

Given the flawed logic, the program will not always produce the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
