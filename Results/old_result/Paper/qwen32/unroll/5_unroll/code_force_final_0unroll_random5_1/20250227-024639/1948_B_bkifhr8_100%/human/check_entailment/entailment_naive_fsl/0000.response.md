Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers is flawed. The program only checks if the current number and the digits of the previous number can be rearranged to form a sorted sequence, but it does not account for the possibility of further splits being necessary or the impact of those splits on the rest of the array.

Let's consider a specific test case that demonstrates the flaw:

**Test Case:**

```
1
4
12 33 11 2
```

**Expected Output:**

```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**

- We can split `33` into `3` and `3`, resulting in the array `[12, 3, 3, 11, 2]`.
- Then we can split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 11, 2]`.
- Finally, we can rearrange the elements to `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 11]`, which is sorted.

**Actual Output from the Program:**

```
NO
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**

- The program checks if `33` and `12` can be rearranged to form a sorted sequence, which they cannot (`[3, 3, 1, 2]` is not sorted).
- Since the program only checks adjacent elements and does not consider further splits, it incorrectly concludes that the array cannot be sorted.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
