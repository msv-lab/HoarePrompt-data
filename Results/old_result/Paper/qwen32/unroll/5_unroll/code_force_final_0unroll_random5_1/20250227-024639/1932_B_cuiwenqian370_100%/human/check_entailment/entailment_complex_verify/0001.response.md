Reasoning: The original assessment correctly analyzes the problem and verifies the solution with the provided example test cases. The program reads the input, processes each test case by calculating the year of each sign's occurrence based on the given periodicities, and outputs the year of the n-th sign's occurrence for each test case. The annotations in the annotated code match the expected behavior of the program, and the calculations for each test case in the original assessment are accurate and consistent with the problem description.

The logic used in the program to determine the year of the next sign's occurrence is correct. The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`, which aligns with the requirement that signs must occur sequentially.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
