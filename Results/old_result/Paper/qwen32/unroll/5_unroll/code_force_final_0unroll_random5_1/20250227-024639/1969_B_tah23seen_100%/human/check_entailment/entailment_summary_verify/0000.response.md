### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` to ensure it correctly computes the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Cyclic Shift**: Moving the last character of a substring to the beginning.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `k` is `k`.
- **Objective**: Find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string `s` in non-descending order.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` calculates the cost by iterating through the string `s`.
- It maintains a count of consecutive '1's (`one`).
- When a '0' is encountered after some '1's, it adds `one + 1` to the cost.

#### Key Points to Validate:
1. **Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - **Explanation**: When a '0' follows one or more '1's, it implies that the '1's need to be shifted to the right of the '0'. The cost of this shift is the length of the substring that includes the '1's and the '0' itself, which is `one + 1`.
   - **Example**: For string `110`, the cost is `3` because the substring `110` needs to be shifted to `011`, and the cost is `3`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All '0's or All '1's**: The cost should be `0` since the string is already sorted.
   - **Alternating '0's and '1's**: The cost should correctly account for the number of shifts required.
   - **Multiple Blocks of '1's Separated by '0's**: The cost should sum up the costs for each block of '1's followed by a '0'.

#### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples and additional edge cases.

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`
   - **Explanation**: One '1' before a '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `0000`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0`
   - **Explanation**: No '1's, so no cost.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `11000`
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - Program Output: `9`
   - **Explanation**: Two '1's before the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`. Another '1' before the next '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `101011`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Program Output: `5`
   - **Explanation**: One '1' before the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the second '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `01101001`
   - Expected Output: `11`
   - Program Output: `11`
   - **Explanation**: Two '1's before the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`. Another '1' before the second '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. One '1' before the third '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the fourth '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 11`.

6. **Additional Edge Cases**:
   - **Input**: `1111`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0`
   - **Explanation**: No '0's, so no cost.

   - **Input**: `010101`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Program Output: `6`
   - **Explanation**: One '1' before the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the second '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the third '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts for all tested cases. The logic of counting '1's and adding the cost when a '0' is encountered is consistent with the problem description.
