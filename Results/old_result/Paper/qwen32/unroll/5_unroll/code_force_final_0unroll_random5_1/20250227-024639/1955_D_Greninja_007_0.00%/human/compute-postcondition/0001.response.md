The code snippet creates a `Counter` object named `b_freq` from the list `b`. This `Counter` will hold the frequency of each integer in the list `b`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Similarly, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `good_subarrays` is 0. `b_freq` is a Counter object that holds the frequency of each integer in the list `b`.**
