The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `q`. Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, it doesn't need any specific state adjustment. The loop will execute based on the value of `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `q` must be greater than 0.

State: **`ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` represents the count of `1`s in the `nums` list from index `0` to `i-1`, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` represents the sum of all elements in the `nums` list from index `0` to `i-1`, minus the number of elements in that range, `q` must be greater than 0**
