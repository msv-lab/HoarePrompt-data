To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that doesn't need to be adjusted as it is automatically assigned by the `range` function during each iteration.

The only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`. Since `t` is given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), to ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

Since `t` is already given to be within this range, no further adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The other variables (`n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.
