The code snippet `N = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `N`. The initial state mentions `t`, `n`, and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`, but these are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `N` is the integer value read from input.**
