Reasoning: 

The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after potentially rearranging the array. The key insight is that to maximize this sum, we should arrange the elements in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order.

The function `func_1` sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, the differences are simply `array[i] - array[i - 1]` (no need for absolute value after sorting). This approach ensures that we are capturing the maximum possible beauty because sorting naturally maximizes the sum of consecutive differences.

`func_2` handles the input parsing and output generation. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each array using `func_1`, and prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` matches the problem's requirement to maximize the beauty by sorting the array. The annotated states in the comments align with the expected behavior of the functions, and the overall flow of `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

Given that the provided functions together accurately implement the solution to the problem, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
