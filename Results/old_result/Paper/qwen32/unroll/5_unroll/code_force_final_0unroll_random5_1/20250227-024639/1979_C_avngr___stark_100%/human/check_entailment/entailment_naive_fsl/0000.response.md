Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not address the problem description at all. The problem requires a function to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. 

The given code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers. This functionality is unrelated to the problem of distributing bets in the game as described.

To solve the problem, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that for each outcome, the total bet is less than the return if that outcome wins. One simple solution is to bet 1 coin on each outcome, which works if the smallest multiplier is greater than 1 (which it is, as per the problem constraints).

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def solve(test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, multipliers in test_cases:
        total_bet = n
        if min(multipliers) > 1:
            results.append([1] * n)
        else:
            results.append([-1])
    return results

# Example usage:
test_cases = [
    (3, [3, 2, 7]),
    (2, [3, 3]),
    (5, [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]),
    (6, [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]),
    (3, [6, 3, 2]),
    (5, [9, 4, 6, 8, 3])
]

for result in solve(test_cases):
    print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

This code checks if the smallest multiplier is greater than 1 and assigns 1 coin to each outcome. If not, it returns -1, as it's impossible to distribute the coins in a way that satisfies the condition.
