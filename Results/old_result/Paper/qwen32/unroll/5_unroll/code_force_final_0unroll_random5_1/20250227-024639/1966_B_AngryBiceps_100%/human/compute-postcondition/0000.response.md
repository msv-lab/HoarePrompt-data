In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, and the range is determined by the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t` (which is the number of test cases).

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, this state already ensures that the loop can execute because `t` directly determines the number of iterations. There are no other variables in the loop head that need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts already satisfies the requirement for the loop to execute. The state can be described as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
