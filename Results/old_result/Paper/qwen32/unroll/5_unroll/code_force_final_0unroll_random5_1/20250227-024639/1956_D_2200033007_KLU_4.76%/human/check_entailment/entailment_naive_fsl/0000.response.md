Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the MEX operation. The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and outputs fixed results without considering the actual values in the array or performing any operations.

Let's analyze the program with the examples provided in the problem description:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `2\n0 1`
   - Expected Output: `4 1\n1 2`
   - Actual Output: `4 1` (since the length of the array is 2, the program outputs `4 1` without performing any operations)

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `3\n1 3 9`
   - Expected Output: `13 0`
   - Actual Output: `13 0` (since the length of the array is not 2, the program outputs `13 0` without performing any operations)

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `4\n1 100 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`
   - Actual Output: `13 0` (since the length of the array is not 2, the program outputs `13 0` without performing any operations)

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `1\n0`
   - Expected Output: `1 1\n1 1`
   - Actual Output: `13 0` (since the length of the array is not 2, the program outputs `13 0` without performing any operations)

The program does not perform any operations on the array and does not calculate the MEX value for any subarray. It simply outputs predefined results based on the length of the array, which is incorrect for all cases except the first example where the length is 2. For all other cases, the program fails to compute the correct maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
