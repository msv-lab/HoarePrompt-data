Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the winner based on the number of facing-up ('U') coins. The key insight is that if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because each move reduces the number of 'U' coins by one, and the player who faces an odd number of 'U' coins at the start of their turn can always force the game to end with them making the last move. The provided code accurately implements this logic.
