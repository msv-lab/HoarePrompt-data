Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string and outputs that difference. However, the problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty after optimally splitting the array derived from the string into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray based on the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program's logic is completely different from the required solution. It does not perform any splitting of the array, does not calculate the penalties for any subarrays, and does not find the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **False**
