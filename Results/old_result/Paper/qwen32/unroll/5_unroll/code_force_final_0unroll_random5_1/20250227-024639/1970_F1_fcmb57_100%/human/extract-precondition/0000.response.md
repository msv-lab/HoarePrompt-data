Precondition: **a is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99, and a is odd); b is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and b is odd). The field is represented by a list of a strings, where each string contains b pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities in the field. The next input is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000), followed by T lines, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field.**
