To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the computation of `ans` based on the given initial state.

### Breakdown of the Initial State:

1. **t, n, arr, prefix**: These variables remain unchanged and are not directly relevant to the computation of `ans` in the provided context.
2. **pre**: A list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[count of 0s, count of 1s]` represents the counts of 0s and 1s for the corresponding bit position across the `prefix[1]` to `prefix[n]` range.
3. **suf**: A list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[count of 0s, count of 1s]` represents the counts of 0s and 1s for the corresponding bit position across the `prefix[i+1]` to `prefix[n]` range.
4. **ans**: Computed as the sum of products of counts of 0s and 1s in `pre[k]` and `suf[k]` for each bit position `k` from 0 to 31.

### Calculation of `ans`:

The variable `ans` is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{ans} = \sum_{k=0}^{31} (\text{pre}[k][0] \times \text{suf}[k][1]) + (\text{pre}[k][1] \times \text{suf}[k][0]) \]

This formula essentially sums up the products of the counts of 0s in `pre` and the counts of 1s in `suf`, plus the products of the counts of 1s in `pre` and the counts of 0s in `suf` for each bit position `k`.

### Output:

Given the above calculation, the `print(ans)` statement will output the computed value of `ans`, which is the sum described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of products of counts of 0s and 1s in pre[k] and suf[k] for each bit position k from 0 to 31)**
