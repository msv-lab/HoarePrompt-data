Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each involving an integer `X`. For each test case, it performs a series of operations to reduce `X` to 1, appending either a maximum or minimum value to a list based on whether `X` is even or odd. It then outputs the number of operations performed and the sequence of appended values for each test case.**
