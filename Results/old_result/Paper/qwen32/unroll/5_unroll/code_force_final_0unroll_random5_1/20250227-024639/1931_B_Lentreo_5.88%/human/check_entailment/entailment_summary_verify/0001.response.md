### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary in detail to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key point is that the sum of water across all containers is divisible by the number of containers, meaning there is a target amount of water each container should hold to be equalized.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates a specific condition based on the differences between each element and the last element. Here's the provided code again for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The code calculates the difference between each element and the last element and sums these differences. This does not accurately determine if the water can be evenly distributed among all containers.
   - The check `if curr == 0` is not a valid condition to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total water divided by the number of containers.
   - Check if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has the target amount. This can be done by ensuring that at no point in the redistribution process do we need to pour water from a container that already has less water than the target amount.

#### Correct Solution Logic:
1. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have.
2. Use a prefix sum approach to check if it's possible to redistribute the water:
   - Keep a running total of the water in the containers.
   - At each step, check if the running total is sufficient to fill the containers up to the target amount.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        curr = 0
        can_distribute = True
        for i in nums:
            curr += i
            if curr < target * (nums.index(i) + 1):
                can_distribute = False
                break
        if can_distribute:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

However, the corrected code above has a small issue in the loop condition `if curr < target * (nums.index(i) + 1):`. The `nums.index(i)` will always return the first occurrence of `i` in the list, which is not what we want. Instead, we should use a loop counter to keep track of the current index. Here is the corrected version with the proper loop counter:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        curr = 0
        can_distribute = True
        for i in range(n):
            curr += nums[i]
            if curr < target * (i + 1):
                can_distribute = False
                break
        if can_distribute:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
