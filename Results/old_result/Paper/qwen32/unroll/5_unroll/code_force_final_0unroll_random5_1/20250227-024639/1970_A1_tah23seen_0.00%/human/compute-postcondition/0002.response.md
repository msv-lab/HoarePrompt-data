The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `ans`. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is an empty dictionary.**
