Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s`, and `s` itself, which consists only of the characters "U" and "D". The function returns the final depth for each test case, where "U" increases the depth by 1 and "D" decreases the depth by 1.**
