Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences.
- If no such array exists, we should return -1.
- Increasing subsequences are sequences that can be derived by removing elements from the original array without changing the order, and the remaining elements must be strictly increasing.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n - 1, result)` where `n` is `X`.
   - `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that meets the criteria of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a `number` and a `sequence` list.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence and the value to append to the sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences.
   - It recursively calculates the sequence until the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. However, it does not handle the case where no such sequence exists.
- **Logic for Sequence Generation**: The logic inside `func_1` is complex and seems to be based on a mathematical approach to generate the sequence. However, it does not directly address the problem of generating an increasing subsequence with exactly `X` subsequences.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `X` is not a valid number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by any array of length at most 200.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not guarantee that it will find a valid array for all valid inputs `X` within the constraints. It also does not handle the case where no such array exists by returning `-1`. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
