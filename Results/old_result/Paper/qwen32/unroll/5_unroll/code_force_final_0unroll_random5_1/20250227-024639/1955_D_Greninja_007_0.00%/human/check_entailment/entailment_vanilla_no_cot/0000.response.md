Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the way it updates the `matches` count when sliding the window. Specifically, when updating the frequency of the element that is sliding out of the window and the element that is sliding into the window, the `matches` count is not updated correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(a, b, k, n, m):
    good_subarrays = 0
    b_freq = Counter(b)
    window_freq = Counter(a[:m])
    matches = sum((min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in b_freq))
    if matches >= k:
        good_subarrays += 1
    for i in range(n - m):
        if a[i] in b_freq:
            if window_freq[a[i]] <= b_freq[a[i]]:
                matches -= 1
            window_freq[a[i]] -= 1
            if window_freq[a[i]] == 0:
                del window_freq[a[i]]
        if a[i + m] in b_freq:
            window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1
            if window_freq[a[i + m]] <= b_freq[a[i + m]]:
                matches += 1
        if matches >= k:
            good_subarrays += 1
    return good_subarrays

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    print(func_1(a, b, k, n, m))
```

In the corrected version:
1. The initial `matches` count is calculated correctly.
2. When an element slides out of the window, if its count in the window is less than or equal to its count in `b`, we decrement `matches`.
3. When an element slides into the window, if its count in the window is less than or equal to its count in `b`, we increment `matches`.

This ensures that the `matches` count is updated correctly as the window slides through the array `a`.
