Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1(x)` that is supposed to find such a \( y \). Here's a detailed breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**: `max_val` is initialized to 1. This variable will store the best \( y \) found so far that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

2. **Loop through possible \( y \) values**:
   - The loop iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \% y == 0 \). This condition ensures that \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).

3. **Check the condition \( 2 * y \geq x \)**:
   - If \( 2 * y \geq x \), the function immediately returns \( y \). This is because if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), and the expression becomes \( y + y = 2 * y \). If \( 2 * y \geq x \), this will be the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( y \) is as large as possible while still being a divisor of \( x \).

4. **Update `max_val`**:
   - If \( 2 * y < x \), the function updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues the loop. This step is not strictly necessary for correctness, as the function will return the first \( y \) it finds that satisfies \( 2 * y \geq x \).

5. **Return `max_val`**:
   - If no \( y \) is found such that \( 2 * y \geq x \), the function returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of \( x \) found in the loop.

### Correctness Check:
The function correctly implements the logic to find \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Hereâ€™s why:

- **Divisor Check**: The function only considers \( y \) that are divisors of \( x \), which is necessary because the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) is maximized when \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
- **Maximization**: The condition \( 2 * y \geq x \) ensures that the function finds the largest possible \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). This is because if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), and the expression becomes \( 2 * y \). If \( 2 * y \) is maximized, the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is also maximized.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where \( x \) is a prime number or has no divisors larger than \( x/2 \) by returning the largest divisor found.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for any valid input \( x \).

Correctness: **True**
