### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is supposed to decode an encoded string `b` back to its original string `s` using the encoding rules described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program step by step to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (length of the encoded string `b`) and the encoded string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function `func_1(b)` is called for each encoded string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1(b)`, it first creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character in the reverse sorted order of `r`. This is done using a dictionary `char_map`.
   - For example, if `r` is "cdefors", the mapping would be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'e'
     - 'f' -> 'd'
     - 'o' -> 'o'
     - 'r' -> 'f'
     - 's' -> 'c'
   - The program then constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - The decoded string `s` is returned and printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Mapping**:
  - The mapping created in `char_map` is correct according to the problem statement. Each character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in the reverse order.
  
- **Reversibility**:
  - The decoding process correctly reverses the encoding process. Since the encoding process replaces each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`, the decoding process reverses this by replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r` again, effectively restoring the original string `s`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with all identical characters correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s` following the rules provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
