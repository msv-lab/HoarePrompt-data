Reasoning:
The provided code is intended to solve the problem by determining a suitable distribution of bets across different outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome. However, there are issues in the implementation of the functions `func_1` and `func_2` that affect the correctness of the solution.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, which is done correctly by returning the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the comment mistakenly states that it returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is intended to compute the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`. However, the comment incorrectly states that `result` is the sum of all elements in `numbers`. In reality, `result` is the LCM of all elements in `numbers`.

The main logic of the program uses these functions to find the LCM of the multipliers `k`. It then attempts to distribute the bets by dividing this LCM by each multiplier `k[i]`, resulting in `c[i] = m // k[i]`. The program checks if the sum of these bets is less than `m`. If not, it outputs `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.

However, the logic itself is flawed. The LCM approach does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any outcome. The correct approach would involve finding a set of bets that satisfy the condition, which is not necessarily the LCM divided by each multiplier.

Given the provided implementation and the incorrect comments, the program does not correctly solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
