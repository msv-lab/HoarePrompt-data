Output State: **results is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` is odd or even. The variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `s` for each test case also remain unchanged. The loop has printed each element of the `results` list.**
