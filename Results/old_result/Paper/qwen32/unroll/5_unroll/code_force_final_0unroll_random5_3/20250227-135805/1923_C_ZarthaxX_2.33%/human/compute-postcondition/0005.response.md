To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze what the loop does step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.
   - `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - For each `i`, it updates `ones[i]` and `sum[i]` based on the value of `nums[i - 1]`.

3. **Updates in the Loop**:
   - `ones[i]` is updated to `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`. This means `ones[i]` keeps a running count of how many 1's have been encountered in `nums` up to index `i - 1`.
   - `sum[i]` is updated to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`. This means `sum[i]` keeps a running total of the sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, but each element is decremented by 1 before being added.

After the loop completes, the `ones` and `sum` lists will reflect the cumulative counts and sums as described.

**Output State**:
- `ones[i]` will contain the number of 1's in `nums` from index 0 to `i - 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `sum[i]` will contain the sum of elements in `nums` from index 0 to `i - 1`, with each element decremented by 1, for each `i` from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`ones` is a list where `ones[i]` is the count of 1's in `nums` from index 0 to `i - 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. `sum` is a list where `sum[i]` is the sum of elements in `nums` from index 0 to `i - 1`, with each element decremented by 1, for each `i` from 1 to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
