Reasoning: The provided program is intended to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a 2-row grid given specific movement rules. The logic in the function `func_1` seems to be flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The robot starts at (1, 1). The program initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`, which seems correct for the starting position.

2. **Loop Through Columns**: The program iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow points right (`row1[j] == '>'`), it checks if this is the last column (`j == n - 1`). If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move down to the second row and reach the last column.
     - If the arrow points left (`row1[j] == '<'`), it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` because the robot cannot move left from the first column. It then checks if the corresponding arrow in the second row points right (`row2[j] == '>'`). If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to the second row.
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow points right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it checks if this is the last column (`j == n - 1`). If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` again, which is redundant because it's already `True`.

3. **Final Check**: After the loop, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends `'YES'` to the results list; otherwise, it appends `'NO'`.

The issue lies in the logic for handling the robot's movement:
- The program does not correctly account for the robot's ability to move between rows and columns. It only checks if the robot can move to the second row and then reach the last column, but it does not handle the robot's ability to move back and forth between rows and columns effectively.
- The program does not simulate the robot's movements step-by-step, which is necessary to correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

Given the provided test cases and the expected output, the program does not correctly handle all scenarios. For example, in the third test case, the robot can move from (1, 1) to (2, 1), then to (2, 2), then back to (1, 2), then to (1, 3), and finally to (2, 3) and (2, 4). However, the program incorrectly determines that the robot cannot reach (2, 4).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
