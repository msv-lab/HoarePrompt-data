Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two players, Bodya and Sasha, who compete based on scores derived from a list of positions and values. For each test case, it determines the winner (either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or a 'Draw') after a specified number of iterations, `k`, by calculating the maximum possible scores each player can achieve. The function outputs the result for each test case.**
