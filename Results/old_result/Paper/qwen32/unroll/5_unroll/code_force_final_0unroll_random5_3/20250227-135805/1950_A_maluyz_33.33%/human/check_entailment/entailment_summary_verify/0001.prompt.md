You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three integers, and 'NONE' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
- **Stair**: The digits satisfy the condition \( a < b < c \).
- **Peak**: The digits satisfy the condition \( a < b > c \).
- **Neither**: If neither of the above conditions is met.

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair**: The program correctly checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if true.
   - **Peak**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b`. This condition is true if `b` is the largest of the three numbers, which can mean that `a < b > c` (peak) or `a == b > c` or `a < b == c`. However, the program does not explicitly check if `a < b > c` (peak), so this condition is not sufficient to identify a peak. It might incorrectly classify cases where `b` is the largest but `a` is not strictly less than `b` or `b` is not strictly greater than `c`.
   - **Neither**: The program checks other cases and prints "NONE". However, the condition `a == b == c` is redundant because if `a == b == c`, the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` will also be true, leading to incorrect classification as "PEAK" instead of "NONE".

### Issues Identified:
- The condition for a peak (`max(a, b, c) == b`) is too broad and can incorrectly classify cases.
- The condition `a == b == c` is redundant and can lead to incorrect classification due to the broader peak condition.

### Correct Approach:
- **Stair**: Check `a < b < c`.
- **Peak**: Check `a < b > c`.
- **Neither**: If neither of the above conditions is met.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the broad and incorrect condition for identifying a peak and the redundant condition for checking if all digits are equal.

Correctness: **False**
