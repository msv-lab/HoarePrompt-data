Correctness: **False**

Let's analyze the given program and see why it is incorrect.

### Analysis of the Program

The program is supposed to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions, and then output this value modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The expected value is expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the program should compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates the expected value incorrectly. The expected value for each pair being chosen is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\), where \(m\) is the number of friend pairs and \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs.
   - The program calculates \(c\) as the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct. However, it then incorrectly uses this value to compute the sum of friendship values.
   - The sum of friendship values should be calculated by considering the contribution of each friend pair over the \(k\) excursions. The contribution of a friend pair with initial friendship value \(f\) is the sum of an arithmetic series, which is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot f\).

2. **Incorrect Loop for Sum Calculation:**
   - The program has a loop that iterates \(k\) times, which is inefficient and incorrect for this problem. The correct approach is to calculate the expected value directly using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Summation:**
   - The program incorrectly accumulates the sum \(s\) in the second loop. It should use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the expected value directly.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach involves the following steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Possible Pairs:**
   \[
   \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Probability of Choosing a Friend Pair:**
   \[
   P = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Expected Value for Each Friend Pair:**
   - For each friend pair with initial friendship value \(f\), the expected contribution to the sum over \(k\) excursions is:
   \[
   \text{Contribution} = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot P \cdot f
   \]

4. **Sum the Contributions of All Friend Pairs:**
   \[
   \text{Total Contribution} = \sum_{\text{all friend pairs}} \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot P \cdot f \right)
   \]

5. **Compute the Result Modulo \(10^9 + 7\):**
   - Compute the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Use the formula to compute the total expected value and take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the excursions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
