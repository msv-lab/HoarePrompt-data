The code snippet provided is just reading an integer value from the input and assigning it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases that follow. The values of `x_i` and `y_i` for each test case are not yet read or processed by this code snippet.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, after executing the provided code snippet, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**
