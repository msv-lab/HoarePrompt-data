The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` can be converted to an integer and if that integer is greater than 0. The variable `final` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop will iterate over `range(int(n))`, meaning `n` must be a string that can be successfully converted to an integer.
2. The loop will execute if `int(n)` is greater than 0, as `range(0)` would result in no iterations.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be a string representation of a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a string representing a positive integer, `final` is an empty list**
