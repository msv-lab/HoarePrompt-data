Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the game's final score if both players play optimally. Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by sorting the array and then iterating through it to find the smallest missing non-negative integer. However, the logic is flawed and does not account for the optimal moves by Alice and Bob.

2. **Ignoring Optimal Play**: The program does not simulate the optimal moves by Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program simply calculates the MEX of the sorted array without considering the turns and strategies of the players.

3. **Inconsistent Logic**: The program includes logic that increments `cur` when `num > cur + 1`, but this does not correctly simulate the game's progression or the players' strategies.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Duplicates**: The program counts the occurrences of each number but does not use this information to simulate the game's optimal play effectively.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to analyze the frequency of each number and simulate the game based on the players' strategies. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            if num < S:
                freq[num] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for i in range(S):
            if freq[i] == 0:
                break
            if freq[i] % 2 == 1:
                mex = i + 1
        print(mex)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the frequency of each number in the array and determines the MEX based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob.
