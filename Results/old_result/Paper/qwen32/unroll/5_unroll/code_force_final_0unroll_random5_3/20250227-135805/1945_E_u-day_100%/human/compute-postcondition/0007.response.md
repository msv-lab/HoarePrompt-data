To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `low + 1 < high` is true. Let's analyze the variables involved in this condition:

- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to `n`.

For the loop to execute, `low + 1` must be less than `high`. Therefore, `1 < high` must be true, which implies that `high` must be greater than 1.

Since `high` is set to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `st`) are not directly involved in the loop condition, so we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` is -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set**
