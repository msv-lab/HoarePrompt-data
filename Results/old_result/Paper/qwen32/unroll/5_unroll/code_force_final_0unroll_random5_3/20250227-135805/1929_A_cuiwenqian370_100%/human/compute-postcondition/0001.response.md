The code snippet reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This means `data` will be a list of strings, where each string is one of the integers from the input.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n (2 <= n <= 100), and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is one of the integers from the input.**

In natural language: The variable `data` now holds a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input. The initial state of `array` remains unchanged.
