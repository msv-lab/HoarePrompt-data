### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

The problem states that we need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, with the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

The program provided does not actually implement the correct logic to solve this problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates a `curr` variable by summing up the differences between each element and the last element of the list. This doesn't take into account the requirement of pouring water from smaller indices to larger indices.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic in the code does not ensure that water can be distributed correctly according to the problem's constraints. It simply checks if the sum of differences is zero, which is not a valid check for the problem's requirements.

3. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve checking if the prefix sums up to the required amount at each step. Specifically, after the i-th step, the sum of the first i elements should be equal to i * (total_sum / n), where total_sum is the sum of all elements in the list and n is the number of containers. This ensures that the water can be evenly distributed according to the problem's constraints.

### Example Analysis:
For the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]):
- The correct approach would check if the prefix sums are valid:
  - After 1st step: 4 == 4 (1 * 4)
  - After 2nd step: 4 + 5 == 8 (2 * 4)
  - After 3rd step: 4 + 5 + 2 == 11 (not equal to 12, so invalid, but the correct program would continue checking)
  - After 4th step: 4 + 5 + 2 + 1 == 12 (4 * 4)
  - After 5th step: 4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 == 15 (5 * 4)

Since the prefix sums do not match the expected values at each step, the program should return "NO". However, the given program might not correctly identify this.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
