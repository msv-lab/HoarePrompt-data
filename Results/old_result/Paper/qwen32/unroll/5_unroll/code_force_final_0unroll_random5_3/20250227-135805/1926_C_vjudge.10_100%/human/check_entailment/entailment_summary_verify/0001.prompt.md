You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The task requires us to compute the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases. The program needs to handle up to 10,000 test cases, with each `n` being as large as 200,000. Given the constraints, an efficient approach is necessary.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes an array `values` of size `2 * 10^5 + 1` (200,001) to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to each integer `i`.
   - `inf` is set to `2 * 10^5 + 1` to ensure the array can handle the largest possible `n`.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The program iterates through each integer `i` from 1 to `inf - 1`.
   - For each `i`, it converts `i` to a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts it back to an integer, and adds it to `sum_value_digits`.
   - The cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `i` is stored in `values[i]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

### Correctness Check

- **Precomputation Accuracy:** The program correctly computes the digit sum for each integer and stores the cumulative sum in the `values` array. This ensures that for any `n`, the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` can be retrieved in constant time.
- **Efficiency:** Precomputing the cumulative sums up to `2 * 10^5` ensures that each test case is handled in constant time, making the program efficient enough to handle up to 10,000 test cases within the time limit.
- **Output:** The program outputs the correct cumulative sum of the digit sums for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem by precomputing the cumulative sums of the digit sums and efficiently handling each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
