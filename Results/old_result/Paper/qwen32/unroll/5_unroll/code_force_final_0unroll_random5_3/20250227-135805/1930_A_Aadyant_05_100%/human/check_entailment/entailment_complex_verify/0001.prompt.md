You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The next line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), the number of test cases.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: `final` is a list of sums of elements at even indices of the sorted lists from each iteration. `n` remains unchanged as the input string.
    #
    #Since the specific values of `n` and the inputs for `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the structure of the `final` list in terms of the operations performed.
    #
    #Output State:
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: `final` is a list of sums of elements at even indices of the sorted lists from each iteration. `n` remains unchanged as the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). The function then prints the sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the score by performing `n` moves where each move involves selecting two numbers from the list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both numbers from the list. Since we need to maximize the score and we are adding the smaller of the two numbers each time, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest numbers together.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes a score `s` to `0`.
   - It reads the list of integers, converts them to integers, and sorts them.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list, adding every second element (starting from the first) to the score `s`. This effectively pairs the smallest numbers together.
   - The score for each test case is appended to the `final` list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the score for each test case.

### Correctness Check

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy:
- By sorting the list, the smallest numbers are at the beginning.
- By adding every second element starting from the first, the program is effectively pairing the smallest numbers together, which maximizes the score.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program expects the input to be provided in a specific format, but it does not handle the input correctly. It reads `n` and then reads two lines for each test case, which is incorrect. It should read `n` and then a single line with `2n` integers.
   
2. **Variable Naming:**
   - The variable `a` is read but not used. This can be removed.
   
3. **Code Efficiency:**
   - The program can be made more efficient by removing unnecessary variables and simplifying the input reading process.

### Corrected Input Handling

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        list2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list2.sort()
        s = sum(list2[i] for i in range(0, len(list2), 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a critical issue with input handling and can be simplified. However, the core logic of sorting and summing every second element is correct. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect** due to improper input handling.

Correctness: **False**
