Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The task requires splitting the array into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty, defined as the sum of penalties of each subarray, is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

However, the given program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference for each test case. This does not take into account the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the total penalty.

The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal way to split the array to achieve the minimum penalty, which is not implemented in the provided code.

Correctness: **False**
