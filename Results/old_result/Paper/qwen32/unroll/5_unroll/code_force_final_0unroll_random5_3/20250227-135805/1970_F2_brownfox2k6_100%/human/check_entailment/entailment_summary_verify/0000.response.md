### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying several critical issues with the provided code snippets. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the given program is incorrect based on the problem description and the function summaries:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Movement Handling**: `func_1` correctly updates the coordinates of an object based on the direction provided (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - **Boundary Checks**: The function does not check if the movement results in the object going out of the grid boundaries. This is crucial to ensure that players and balls remain within the field.
   - **Entity Interaction**: The function does not handle interactions with other entities such as Bludgers, goals, or other players. For example, it does not check if a player moves to a cell containing a Bludger (which would result in elimination) or a goal (which would result in a score).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Elimination Handling**: `func_2` correctly identifies players on the same cell as the Bludger, eliminates them, and prints the appropriate message.
   - **Sorting**: The function sorts the players being eliminated alphabetically, which is required by the problem description.
   - **Missing Functionalities**: 
     - **Goal Scoring**: The function does not handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into a goal, which would require updating the score and resetting the Quaffle's position.
     - **Quaffle Handling**: The function does not handle the catching, carrying, or throwing of the Quaffle.
     - **Final Score Output**: The function does not handle the final score output at the end of the game.

3. **Overall Missing Functionalities**:
   - **Action Handling**: The provided code does not handle all types of actions such as catching (`C`), throwing (`T`), and moving (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - **Score Tracking**: The code does not keep track of the scores for each team.
   - **Quaffle Management**: The code does not manage the Quaffle's position, including its initial placement and movement when thrown or caught.
   - **Final Output**: The code does not print the final score at the end of the game.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, the original assessment is correct. The provided code snippets do not fully implement the problem description and are missing several critical functionalities required to correctly simulate the game and produce the required output.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
