### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the program provided, using the annotations and the original assessment to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines follow, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Outputs**:
   - For each test case, the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the expected value in its simplest form.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: The modulus value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`: The modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children. This is used to compute the probability of selecting any specific pair of children.
   - `s = 0`: This will store the sum of the expected friendship values.
   - `a = 0`: This will store the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

2. **Processing Friendships**:
   - The program iterates over the `m` pairs of friends and sums their initial friendship values into `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Sum**:
   - The program then iterates `k` times, each time updating `s` with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to update `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a specific pair and the increase in friendship value over `k` excursions.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: The program uses modular arithmetic correctly for the modulus `M`, but the formula itself is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly compute the expected value, we need to consider:
- The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions is `k * (k + 1) / 2` (since the friendship value increases by 1 each time it is selected).
- The expected value for each pair of friends is their initial value plus the expected increase.
- The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs, weighted by their probability of being selected.

### Correct Formula:
The expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions is `k * (k + 1) / 2`. Therefore, the expected value for a pair with initial friendship value `f_i` is `f_i + k * (k + 1) / 2`. Since the probability of selecting any specific pair is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, the contribution of each pair to the total expected value is `(f_i + k * (k + 1) / 2) / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`. Summing this over all pairs and taking the result modulo `M` gives the correct answer.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**

The program's formula for updating `s` is incorrect, leading to an incorrect calculation of the expected value.
