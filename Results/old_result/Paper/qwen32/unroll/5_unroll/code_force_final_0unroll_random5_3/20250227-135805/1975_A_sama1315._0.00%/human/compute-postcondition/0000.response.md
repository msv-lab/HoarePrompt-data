The provided code snippet is:
```
input = sys.stdin.read
```

The impact of this code is that it reassigns the variable `input` to the function `sys.stdin.read`. This means that `input` will now refer to the function that reads from the standard input, instead of the built-in `input()` function. However, this change does not affect the initial state of the list `arr` or the integer `n`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.read`.**
