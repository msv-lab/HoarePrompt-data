Reasoning:
The given program attempts to determine whether it is possible to sort the array using the specified operation. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. The program uses a function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted. This function is defined after the loop and is used correctly to check the sorted state of the list.
2. The main logic of the program is flawed. The program iterates through the list and checks if the list is sorted using `func_1`. If it is not sorted, it checks if the current element and the previous one are out of order and if the previous one is greater than or equal to 10. If these conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the previous element into its digits.
3. However, the logic for splitting the numbers and inserting them back into the list is incorrect. The program only performs the operation once per iteration and does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split or where the split operation needs to be repeated multiple times.
4. The program does not handle the case where the split operation causes the list to become sorted in a subsequent iteration.
5. The program does not correctly handle the case where the list is already sorted initially.

Let's consider the second test case in the example:
Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```
For the second test case, the program will check if the list `[12, 28, 5]` is sorted, which it is not. It will then check if `12` and `28` are out of order, which they are not. It will then check if `28` and `5` are out of order, which they are. However, it will not split `28` into `2` and `8` because `28` is not greater than `5`. The program will then print `NO`, which is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed and does not cover all cases.

A correct solution would need to repeatedly apply the split operation until no more splits can be made or until the list is sorted. The current program does not implement this logic correctly.

Correctness: **False**
