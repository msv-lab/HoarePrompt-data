The provided task involves a `for` loop that iterates over the `results` list. The loop head only contains the variable `result`, which is used to iterate over each element in the `results` list. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `results` list itself to ensure that the loop can execute.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `results`, so `results` must be a list with at least one element for the loop to execute.
- The other variables (`index`, `array`, `t`, `data`, and `func_1(array)`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element. The other variables can remain as described in the output state.

State: **`results` is a list with at least one element**
