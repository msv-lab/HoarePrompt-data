To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c` (Alice) or simply removing them from `a` (Bob). The goal is to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` at the end of the game when both players play optimally.

### Optimal Strategy
- **Alice's Goal:** Maximize the MEX of `c`.
- **Bob's Goal:** Minimize the MEX of `c`.

### MEX Calculation
The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. For example, the MEX of `[0, 1, 3]` is `2`.

### Steps in the Program
1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, read the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the array `N`. This helps in easily identifying the smallest integers that are missing.

3. **Tracking Elements:**
   - Initialize `cur` to `-1` to track the current MEX.
   - Use a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each element in `N`.

4. **Determining MEX:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
       - If `num > cur + 1`, then the MEX is `cur + 1` (since `cur + 1` is missing).
       - Otherwise, update `cur` to the current number and increment its count in `M`.
   - If all elements up to `cur` are present in the array, check if the sum of counts of elements in `M` equals `S`. If so, increment `cur` by 1.
   - Finally, check if any integer `i` up to `cur` has a count less than or equal to `i`. If so, set `cur` to `i` and break.

5. **Output:**
   - Print the final value of `cur` as the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis
The provided program attempts to determine the MEX by sorting the array and tracking the counts of elements. However, there are some issues with the logic:

1. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program increments `cur` only when it encounters a new unique element or when a gap is found. This is correct for determining the MEX in a sorted list.
   
2. **Final Check:**
   - The final check where it verifies if the sum of counts equals `S` and increments `cur` if true seems unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The MEX should be determined based on the presence of integers in the sorted array, not the sum of counts.
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where all elements are the same or where the array is already sorted in a way that the MEX is not straightforward.

### Conclusion
The program's logic for determining the MEX is flawed due to the unnecessary final check and incorrect handling of certain edge cases. Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
