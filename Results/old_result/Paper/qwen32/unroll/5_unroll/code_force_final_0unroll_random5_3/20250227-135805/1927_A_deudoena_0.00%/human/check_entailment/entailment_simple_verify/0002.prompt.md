You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

    inpstr = input()

        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the given program and the problem requirements step by step.

The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The strategy to solve this problem should involve identifying the first and last black cells and calculating the segment length that includes all black cells.

Here is the provided program:

```python
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
```

Let's break down the program:
1. `inpstr = input()`: This line reads the input string which represents the strip of cells.
2. `ind1 = 0` and `ind2 = 0`: These variables are initialized to 0.
3. The first `for` loop finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' (black) and stores it in `ind1`.
4. The second `for` loop finds the index of the last occurrence of 'B' by iterating from the end of the string and stores the distance from the end in `ind2`.
5. The length of the segment that needs to be painted white is calculated as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` and printed.

However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the segment length. The correct way to calculate the length of the segment that includes all black cells is by using `ind2` as the index from the end, which should be converted to the actual index from the start. The correct calculation should be `ind1 + ind2 + 1`.

The correct code should look like this:
```python
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(ind1 + ind2 + 1)
```

Given the incorrect calculation in the provided program, the program is not correct.
