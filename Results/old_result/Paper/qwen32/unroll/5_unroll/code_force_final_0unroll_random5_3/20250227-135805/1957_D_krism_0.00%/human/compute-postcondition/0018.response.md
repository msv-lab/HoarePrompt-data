To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand how the variable `ans` is calculated based on the given initial state.

### Breakdown of the Initial State:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **n**: An integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. **a**: A list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
4. **arr**: A list of integers read from the input.
5. **prefix**: A list of length \(\text{len(arr)} + 1\) where the \(i+1\)th element is the XOR of the first \(i\) elements of `arr`.
6. **pre**: A list of 32 sublists, each containing \([ \text{count of 0s}, \text{count of 1s} ]\) for each bit position across the `prefix` array.
7. **suf**: A list of 32 sublists, each containing \([0, 0]\) for each bit position.
8. **ans**: The accumulated value based on the counts of 0s and 1s.

### Calculation of `ans`:

The variable `ans` is calculated based on the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position across the `prefix` array. Specifically, for each bit position (from 0 to 31), the contribution to `ans` is determined by the number of 0s and 1s at that bit position.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prefix Calculation**:
   - The `prefix` list is constructed such that `prefix[i+1]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`.
   - For example, if `arr = [a1, a2, a3]`, then `prefix = [0, a1, a1^a2, a1^a2^a3]`.

2. **Pre Calculation**:
   - The `pre` list is a list of 32 sublists, each containing the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position across the `prefix` array.
   - For each bit position \(b\) (from 0 to 31), `pre[b]` is \([ \text{count of 0s at bit position b}, \text{count of 1s at bit position b} ]\).

3. **Suf Calculation**:
   - The `suf` list is initialized with all zeros and is used to store cumulative counts of 0s and 1s from the end of the `prefix` array.
   - This list is typically used to help in the calculation of `ans` by considering suffixes of the `prefix` array.

4. **Ans Calculation**:
   - The variable `ans` is accumulated based on the counts of 0s and 1s.
   - For each bit position \(b\), the contribution to `ans` is calculated using the counts of 0s and 1s at that bit position.
   - The exact formula for `ans` is not provided in the initial state, but generally, it involves some combination of the counts of 0s and 1s, possibly weighted by the bit position.

### Output:

Given that the exact formula for `ans` is not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of its calculation based on the counts of 0s and 1s.

Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated value based on the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position across the prefix array)**
