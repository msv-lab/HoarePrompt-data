The provided code snippet only reads input from the standard input but does not process or modify any variables. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged, and no new variables are introduced or modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **The function receives multiple test cases. For each test case, it is given an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin is facing up and "D" indicates a coin is facing down. `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.read`.**
