Let's go through the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field `N` and `M`.
   - It reads the field configuration, identifying positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It correctly identifies goals for both teams and stores their positions.
   - It correctly identifies players and stores their initial positions.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - The program defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map actions ('L', 'R', 'U', 'D') to their respective coordinate changes.
   - For each move, the program updates the position of the player based on the action.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the new position of a player after a move.

3. **Throwing the Quaffle:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle, the program checks if the player's position is in the goals of the opposing team.
   - If the player is in a red goal, it increments the blue team's score and prints "BLUE GOAL".
   - If the player is in a blue goal, it increments the red team's score and prints "RED GOAL".
   - However, the program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, which is a requirement.

4. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all moves, the program prints the final score of the red and blue teams.

### Issues Identified

- **Quaffle Reset Position:**
  - After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field, which is not handled in the current program.
  - This is a critical part of the problem statement that ensures the game continues correctly after a goal.

### Conclusion

The program handles most of the problem requirements correctly, but it fails to reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. This omission means that the game state is not correctly maintained, which could lead to incorrect results for subsequent moves.

**Correctness: False**

The program is almost correct but lacks the necessary step to reset the Quaffle's position after a goal, which is a crucial part of the game rules according to the problem statement.
