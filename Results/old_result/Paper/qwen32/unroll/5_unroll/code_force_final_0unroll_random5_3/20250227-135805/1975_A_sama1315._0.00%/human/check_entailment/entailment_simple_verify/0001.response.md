### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the logic of `func_1`. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is sorted or not and does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through the specified operation to achieve a sorted order. Specifically, the operation allows for splitting the array into a prefix and suffix and swapping them, which can potentially sort the array even if it is not initially sorted.

Let's break down the issues and provide a correct approach:

1. **Operation Analysis**:
   - The operation involves splitting the array into two parts: a prefix `x` and a suffix `y`, and then swapping these parts to form `y + x`.
   - To determine if the array can be sorted using this operation, we need to check if there exists a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that:
     - The suffix `y` is non-decreasing.
     - The prefix `x` is non-decreasing.
     - The last element of `y` is less than or equal to the first element of `x`.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find a valid split point in the array where the above conditions hold.
   - We can iterate through the array to find such a split point.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if arr[0:i] is non-decreasing
        if not all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i - 1)):
            continue
        # Check if arr[i:] is non-decreasing
        if not all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i, n - 1)):
            continue
        # Check if last element of arr[0:i] is <= first element of arr[i:]
        if i == 0 or arr[i - 1] <= arr[i]:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'
```

### Evaluation with Annotations:

Let's use the annotations to evaluate the behavior of the corrected `func_1`:

- **State before function call**: `arr` is a list of positive integers with length `n` such that `2 <= n <= 50`.
- **Logic**:
  - Iterate through each possible split point `i` in the array.
  - Check if `arr[0:i]` is non-decreasing.
  - Check if `arr[i:]` is non-decreasing.
  - Check if the last element of `arr[0:i]` is less than or equal to the first element of `arr[i:]`.
  - If all conditions are satisfied for any `i`, return 'Yes'.
  - If no valid split point is found, return 'No'.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided `func_1` is incorrect. The corrected version of `func_1` properly checks for the conditions necessary to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the assessment correctly identifies this issue.)
