### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly implements the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob to find the MEX of the array `c`.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them (Bob).
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it attempts to determine the MEX based on the counts of elements in the sorted array. Let's break down the code and its annotations:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted, which helps in determining the MEX more easily.

3. **Tracking Counts:**
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in the sorted array `N`.

4. **Determining MEX:**
   - The code iterates through the sorted array to determine the smallest integer `cur` such that the number of elements in the list less than or equal to `cur` is at least `cur + 1`.

#### Issues:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Fully Implemented:**
   - The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob explicitly. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX based on the counts of elements in the sorted array.
   - Alice and Bob's strategies are not considered. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The code does not account for these strategic choices.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - Alice and Bob will pick `1` alternately, resulting in `c = [1, 1, 1, 1]`. The MEX should be `0`.
     - The code might output `4` because it does not simulate the turns.
   - **Case 2:** `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
     - The MEX should be `1` if both play optimally.
     - The code might output `4` because it does not simulate the turns.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not address the strategic interaction between Alice and Bob.
- The final value of `cur` is determined based on the counts of elements in the sorted array, which does not account for the optimal moves of the players.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not account for their optimal strategies. Therefore, it does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` as required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
