Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges. For each edge, it stores the vertices and the weight.
2. **Graph Representation:** The graph is represented using an adjacency list.
3. **Edge Sorting:** The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights.
4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):** The DSU data structure is used to detect cycles in the graph. The DSU keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.
5. **Cycle Detection:** The program iterates through the sorted edges, using the DSU to detect cycles. When a cycle is detected (i.e., two vertices are already in the same set), it checks if the minimum edge weight in the cycle is smaller than the current smallest.
6. **Cycle Reconstruction:** Once the cycle with the smallest minimum edge weight is found, the program reconstructs the cycle using a Depth-First Search (DFS).
7. **Output:** The program outputs the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the vertices in the cycle.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **DFS Function:** The DFS function `dfs` uses a global variable `graph`, which is not defined within the function. It should be passed as an argument.
2. **DFS Function:** The `node_u` and `node_v` variables used in the DFS function are also global and not passed as arguments.
3. **DFS Function:** The DFS function modifies the `path` list in place and returns it. However, the `path` list is not reset between test cases, which could lead to incorrect results.
4. **Cycle Reconstruction:** The DFS function checks if `node_v` is in the set of visited nodes to determine if a cycle has been found. This is not the correct approach for reconstructing a cycle correctly. The correct approach involves keeping track of the path from the start node to the current node and identifying the cycle when a back edge is encountered.
5. **Edge Weight Update:** The DSU's `union` method should update the minimum edge weight in the set when a new edge is added. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
