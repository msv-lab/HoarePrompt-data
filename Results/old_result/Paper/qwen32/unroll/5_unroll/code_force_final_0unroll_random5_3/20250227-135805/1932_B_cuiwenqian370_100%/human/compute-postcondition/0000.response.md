The provided code snippet only reads the input and does not process it further or modify any variables. Therefore, the variables `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not assigned any values in the given code. The input is read into the variable `input`, which is a string containing the entire input.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The variable `input` is a string containing the entire input.**
