You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). The function then prints the sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` correctly, but it incorrectly reads the subsequent inputs. It reads `a` (which is not used) and then reads the list of integers as a single string `b`. However, it does not handle the case where the number of integers `2n` is not equal to the expected number based on the problem description.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the list of integers as a single string and then splits it into a list of strings. It then converts these strings to integers. This part seems correct, but it should be ensured that the correct number of integers is read for each test case.

3. **Logic for Calculating the Score:**
   - The logic to calculate the score by summing up the minimum of each pair after sorting the list is correct. However, the program does not handle the input format correctly, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly appends the final score for each test case to the `final` list and then prints each score. However, the input reading issue could lead to incorrect scores being calculated.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    final = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        list1 = list(map(int, input[index].split()))
        index += 1
        
        list1.sort()
        s = 0
        for i in range(0, len(list1), 2):
            s += list1[i]
        final.append(s)
    
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

# Uncomment the following line to test the function
# func()
```

This corrected version properly reads the input, processes each test case correctly, and outputs the results as expected. The original program fails to handle the input format correctly, leading to potential incorrect results.
