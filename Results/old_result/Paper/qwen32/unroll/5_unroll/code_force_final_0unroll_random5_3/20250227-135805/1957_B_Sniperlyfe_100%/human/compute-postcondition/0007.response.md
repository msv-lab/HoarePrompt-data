Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list to be returned, and `k` is an integer. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1 + k`. The subsequent elements in the list are either `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` if `k` is smaller than `nums[0] + 1`.**
