Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Initialization and Usage of Arrays `l` and `r`:** The program initializes `l` and `r` as arrays of length `n`, but later uses them to count occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of the array `a`. It should be initialized with a size of `n+1` to accommodate the numbers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Logic for Printing Elements:** The program attempts to print elements for the arrays `l` and `r` directly within the loops, which can lead to incorrect output if the conditions are not met correctly. It also uses `ul` and `ur` to track the number of elements printed, but these are not used consistently to determine when to stop printing.

3. **Handling of XOR Condition:** The program does not actually ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. It simply tries to print elements from the first and second halves of the array `a` without verifying the XOR condition.

4. **Incomplete Handling of `k`:** The program adjusts `k` after printing elements from the first half, but it does not handle the case where `k` is odd or does not evenly divide the remaining elements. It also does not ensure that the second half of the array `a` is used correctly to form the array `r`.

5. **Final Output:** The program does not ensure that the final output arrays `l` and `r` are of length `2k` and that their XORs are equal. The logic for printing elements from the second half of the array `a` is incomplete and incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Initialize `l` and `r` as arrays of length `n+1`.
- Count occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of the array `a`.
- Ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal.
- Ensure that both `l` and `r` are of length `2k`.
- Handle edge cases where `k` is odd or does not evenly divide the remaining elements.

Here is a revised version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        l = [0] * (n + 1)
        r = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            l[a[i]] += 1
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            r[a[i]] += 1
        
        # Create l and r arrays with 2k elements each
        l_elements = []
        r_elements = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if l[i] == 2:
                l_elements.extend([i, i])
            elif l[i] == 1:
                l_elements.append(i)
            if r[i] == 2:
                r_elements.extend([i, i])
            elif r[i] == 1:
                r_elements.append(i)
        
        # Ensure l_elements and r_elements are of length 2k
        l_elements = l_elements[:2 * k]
        r_elements = r_elements[:2 * k]
        
        # Print the results
        print(' '.join(map(str, l_elements)))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r_elements)))

func()
```

This revised version ensures that `l` and `r` are of length `2k` and attempts to create them by including pairs of numbers that appear twice and single numbers that appear once. However, it does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal, which would require a more sophisticated approach.
