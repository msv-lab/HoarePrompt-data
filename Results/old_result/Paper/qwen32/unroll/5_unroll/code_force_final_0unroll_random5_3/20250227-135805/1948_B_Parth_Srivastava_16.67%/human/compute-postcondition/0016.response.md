Functionality: **The function reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`. It processes the list `a` by potentially splitting numbers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, appending them to a new list `c` based on certain conditions. The function then checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it appends `1` to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it modifies the list `b` as a side effect.**
