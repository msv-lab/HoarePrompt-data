In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`. The state of `t` is already provided and does not need adjustment since it is given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop head only involves `t`, and `t` is already defined and within the valid range, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not used in the loop body, so there is no state associated with `_` that needs to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
