The function `count_zero` is not correctly defined according to the problem description. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters related to the number of test cases, the number of integers in the list, the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and the list of integers itself. A correct function definition might look something like `def determine_winner(t, test_cases):` where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing `(n, m, a)` for each test case, with `n` being the number of integers, `m` being the parameter, and `a` being the list of integers.
