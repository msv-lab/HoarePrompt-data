You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns under a promotional pricing strategy. He can sell up to `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins down to `(b - k + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each.

### Key Steps to Maximize Profit
1. **Determine `k`:** The optimal `k` is the number of buns that should be sold at the promotional price. This value is constrained by the fact that `k` cannot exceed the number of buns `n` and also cannot exceed `b - a` (since the price of the `k`-th bun in promotion should be at least `a`).
2. **Calculate Profit:** 
   - If `b <= a`, it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`, since the promotional price does not offer any benefit.
   - Otherwise, the profit from the first `k` buns sold at promotional prices is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`. The sum of this series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `S = (first_term + last_term) * number_of_terms / 2`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a` is simply `(n - k) * a`.

### Program Analysis
Let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determining `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This correctly limits `k` to the number of buns `n` and ensures that the promotional price does not go below the usual price `a`.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly outputs `a * n` (all buns sold at the usual price).
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the arithmetic series sum formula and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the promotional pricing strategy.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
