### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and validate the original assessment using the provided annotations.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1\right) // \text{a[i]} * \text{a[i]}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

3. **Updating `last_year`:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year`.
   - This ensures that the next sign is considered to occur after the current one.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` (the year of the last sign's occurrence) to the results list.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the Program Before Function Call:**
  - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number of signs and their respective periodicities.

- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - The program correctly reads and processes each test case.
  - The formula used to calculate `next_year` ensures that the next sign occurs in the next possible year that is a multiple of `a[i]` and is strictly after `last_year`.

### Conclusion:

The logic and the formula used in the program are correct and accurately reflect the problem's requirements. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected, and the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
