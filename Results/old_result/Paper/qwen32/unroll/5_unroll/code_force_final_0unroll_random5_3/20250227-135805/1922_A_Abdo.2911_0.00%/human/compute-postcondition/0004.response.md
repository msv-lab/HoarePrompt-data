Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it compares three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n` to determine if a specific condition is met. It prints "YES" if the strings `a` and `b` match in a particular way and `c` does not match that way; otherwise, it prints "NO".**
