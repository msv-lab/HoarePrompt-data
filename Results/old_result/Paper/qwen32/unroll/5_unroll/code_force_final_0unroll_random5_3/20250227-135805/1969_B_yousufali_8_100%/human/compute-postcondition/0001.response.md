The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Given that the state before the loop starts is `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0**
