Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the main problems:

1. **Player Catching and Throwing the Quaffle:**
   - The program does not handle the catching and throwing of the Quaffle correctly. It does not keep track of which player is carrying the Quaffle and does not update the position of the Quaffle when a player throws it.

2. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The scoring logic is incorrect. The program only checks if the player is on a goal position after throwing the Quaffle, but it does not verify if the player is carrying the Quaffle at that time.

3. **Quaffle Reset Position:**
   - After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field. The program does not reset the Quaffle's position after a goal is scored.

4. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Messages:**
   - When a player scores in the wrong goal, the program should print the name of the team who wins one point, which is the other team. The program does not handle this correctly.

Let's consider an example to illustrate these issues:

**Example Input:**
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
B2 U
B2 U
B2 L
B2 C .Q
B2 L
B2 L
B2 T
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

In this example, the program seems to produce the correct output, but this is not due to correct logic. It is because the program incorrectly checks if a player is on a goal position after throwing the Quaffle, without verifying if the player is carrying the Quaffle. Additionally, the Quaffle's position is not reset after a goal is scored.

To fix these issues, the program needs to:
- Keep track of which player is carrying the Quaffle.
- Update the Quaffle's position when a player throws it.
- Reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
- Correctly handle the scoring logic to ensure that a player must be carrying the Quaffle to score a goal and to print the correct team name when a player scores in the wrong goal.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
