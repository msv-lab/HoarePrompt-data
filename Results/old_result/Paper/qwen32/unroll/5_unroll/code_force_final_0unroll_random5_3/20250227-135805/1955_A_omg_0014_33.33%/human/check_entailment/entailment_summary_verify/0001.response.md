### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts. There are two options:
1. Buy each yogurt at a price of `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts at a price of `b` burles.

The goal is to find the minimum cost for `n` yogurts, considering these options.

#### Program Analysis

The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Input Parsing Error**:
   - The first integer `n` read from the input is the number of test cases, not the number of yogurts. The subsequent inputs for each test case should be `n`, `a`, and `b`. The code incorrectly interprets the first input as the number of test cases and then reads `(a, b, c)` for each test case. `c` is not defined in the problem; it should be `b`.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The logic in the program is incorrect. The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the problem. It should be `b / 2`. However, even if `c` were `b`, the comparison `a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct logic should be:
     - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought using the promotion: `pairs = n // 2`.
     - Calculate the number of yogurts that will be bought at the regular price: `remaining = n % 2`.
     - The total cost is then `pairs * b + remaining * a`.

3. **Output Error**:
   - The output logic is incorrect. The program should output the total cost calculated based on the optimal strategy, not the comparison between `a * b` and `a * d`.

#### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary states:
- The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * c / 2)` based on which value is smaller.

This summary is incorrect because:
- It mentions `t` as the number of test cases, but the code reads `n` as the number of test cases.
- It uses `c` instead of `b`, and the logic for comparison is incorrect.

#### Correct Implementation

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to input parsing errors, logic errors, and output errors.

**Final: False**
