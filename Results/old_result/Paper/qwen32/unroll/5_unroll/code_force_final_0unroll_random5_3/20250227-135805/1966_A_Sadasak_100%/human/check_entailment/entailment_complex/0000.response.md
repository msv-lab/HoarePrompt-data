### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the specified operations. Let's analyze the logic and the provided states to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards) and `k` (number of cards to exchange).
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Handling Edge Case:**
   - If `k > n`, it correctly prints `n` because no operations can be performed.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number but truncates the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is done to ensure that the frequency does not exceed the number of cards that can be exchanged in one operation.
   - The returned frequency table is used to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left.

4. **Logic for Minimum Cards:**
   - The program then checks if `k` is a value in the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because having a frequency of exactly `k` does not necessarily mean that `k - 1` is the minimum number of cards left. The logic should be based on the total reduction possible from the frequencies.
   - The else clause prints `n`, which is also incorrect. The minimum number of cards left should be calculated based on the sum of the remainders after dividing each frequency by `k`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each unique card number, calculate the remainder when its frequency is divided by `k`. This remainder represents the number of cards that cannot be exchanged away.
- Sum these remainders to get the minimum number of cards that can be left.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
