arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element in each pair n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of sticks available for that test case, and the next n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) represent the lengths of the sticks.
