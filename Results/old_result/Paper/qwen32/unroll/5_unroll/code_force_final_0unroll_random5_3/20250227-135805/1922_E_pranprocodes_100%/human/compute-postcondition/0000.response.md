To determine the state needed for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop's execution depends on the value obtained from `int(input())`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer greater than 0.
2. The value of `t` given in the problem is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, which means `t` is the number of test cases.
3. Since the loop uses `int(input())` directly, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is the value of `t`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state must be adjusted such that `int(input())` returns `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is a positive integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.

The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and the input to `int(input())` is `t`**.
