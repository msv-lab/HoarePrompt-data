### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the logic of `func_1(arr)`. Specifically, the function assumes that if the array is not already sorted in non-decreasing order, it cannot be sorted by the allowed operation of swapping a prefix and suffix. This is incorrect because the operation allows for more complex rearrangements that can potentially sort the array.

To illustrate, consider the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

- **Array**: `[3, 1, 2]`
- **Operation**: Split into `x=[3]` and `y=[1, 2]`, then swap to get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.

The function `func_1(arr)` would incorrectly return "No" for this array because it is not initially sorted, but as shown, it can be sorted by the allowed operation.

The annotations in the annotated version confirm the logic flow and states of the program but do not address the core issue with the logic in `func_1(arr)`. The annotations describe the program's behavior correctly but do not challenge the flawed assumption that an unsorted array cannot be sorted by the allowed operation.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the identified flaw and the counterexample provided, the program does not correctly determine whether an array can be sorted using the allowed operation.

**Final: False**
