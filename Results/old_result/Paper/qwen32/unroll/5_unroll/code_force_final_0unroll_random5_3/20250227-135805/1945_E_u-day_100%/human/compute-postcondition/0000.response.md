The code snippet `n, k = func_1()` suggests that the function `func_1()` returns a tuple of two values which are then unpacked into the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `n` and `k` are overridden by these returned values. The variable `arr` is not affected by this code snippet.

Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific values of `n` and `k` after the execution of the code. However, we can infer that they will hold the values returned by `func_1()`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`.**
