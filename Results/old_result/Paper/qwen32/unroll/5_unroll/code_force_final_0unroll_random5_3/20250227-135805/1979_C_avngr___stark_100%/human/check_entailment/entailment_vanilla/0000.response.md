Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to distribute coins across `n` possible outcomes such that if any one of these outcomes wins, the total amount received is strictly greater than the total amount bet. The received amount for each winning outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by a given multiplier `k_i`.

### Key Points:
1. **Total Bet**: Let the total amount bet be `B = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n`.
2. **Winning Condition**: For each outcome `i`, we need `k_i * x_i > B`.

### Approach:
To satisfy the winning condition for all outcomes, we need to find bets `x_i` such that:
\[ k_i * x_i > B \quad \forall i \]
\[ B = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \]

### Simplification:
One way to ensure this is by setting each `x_i` to a value that makes `k_i * x_i` significantly larger than `B`. One possible strategy is to set `x_i` to a value that leverages the least common multiple (LCM) of all `k_i` values.

### Strategy:
1. Compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all `k_i` values.
2. Set each `x_i` to a fraction of the LCM divided by `k_i` to ensure the condition is met.

### Implementation:
The provided program includes two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
2. `func_2(numbers)`: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the program correctly implements the strategy:
- The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is computed.
- The bets `x_i` are set such that `x_i = LCM / k_i`.

This ensures that for each outcome `i`, `k_i * x_i = LCM`, which is strictly greater than `B` (the total bet) as long as `B < LCM`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the LCM and sets the bets `x_i` to ensure the winning condition is met for all outcomes. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
