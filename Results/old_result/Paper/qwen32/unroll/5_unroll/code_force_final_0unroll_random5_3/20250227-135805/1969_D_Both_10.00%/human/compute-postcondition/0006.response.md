Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, which are lists of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers representing the prices of items for Alice and Bob. The function returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of an initial `sub_summ` and the sums of the elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is non-negative.**
