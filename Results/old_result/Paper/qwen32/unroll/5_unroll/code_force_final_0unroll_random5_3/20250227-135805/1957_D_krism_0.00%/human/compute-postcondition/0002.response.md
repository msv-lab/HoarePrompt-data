The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and then stores them in a new list named `arr`. This means that `arr` will now contain the integers from the input.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged by this code snippet. The output state will reflect the new list `arr` containing the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
