You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each sublist represents a test case. The function returns a new list that is a sorted version of `arr` in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to ensure that each problem in list `a` has a difficulty that is less than or equal to the corresponding problem in list `b`. If not, we can insert new problems (each with a difficulty `w`) into list `a`, sort the list, and remove the most difficult problem to make the difficulties match the expectations.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of problems, and the lists `a` and `b` of difficulties.
3. It initializes a counter `cnt` to count the number of new problems added.
4. It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse through lists `a` and `b`.
5. If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is too difficult compared to the expected difficulty in `b`. The program then:
   - Removes the last element of `a`.
   - Inserts `b[j]` at the position `i` in `a`.
   - Increments the counter `cnt`.
   - Moves pointer `j` to the next problem in `b`.
6. If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` meets the expected difficulty, so it moves both pointers `i` and `j` to the next problems.
7. It prints the counter `cnt` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the insertion and sorting of new problems. The program is attempting to insert `b[j]` directly into `a` at position `i` and then removing the last element, which does not guarantee that the list `a` remains sorted after the insertion. The problem specifies that after inserting a new problem, the list `a` should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and the most difficult problem should be removed. The provided program does not sort the list `a` after inserting `b[j]`.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would be:
- For each problem in `b` that is less than the corresponding problem in `a`, insert a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` into `a`.
- Sort the list `a` after each insertion.
- Remove the last element from `a` after sorting.
- Count the number of insertions made.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
