Let's examine the provided Python code against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case starts with an integer `n` indicating the length of the string `s`.
   - The string `s` contains only the characters `+` and `-`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, we need to output the minimum possible penalty after optimally splitting the array `a` derived from `s`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The array `a` is derived from `s` such that `a[i] = 1` if `s[i] = '+'` and `a[i] = -1` if `s[i] = '-'`.
   - The penalty for a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.
   - The goal is to split `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized.

### Code Analysis:
Let's look at the code provided:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The line `s = int(input())` is incorrect because `s` should be the length of the string, not the string itself. The length of the string is already given by `n`, which is read in the line before.
   - The line `e = input()` correctly reads the string `s`.

2. **Counting '+' and '-':**
   - The code counts the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string `s` and stores these counts in `P` and `M` respectively.
   - However, the logic to calculate the minimum penalty is not implemented. Simply printing `P - M` does not yield the minimum penalty.

3. **Calculating Minimum Penalty:**
   - The minimum penalty requires an optimal splitting strategy. The provided code does not implement any strategy for splitting the array `a` to minimize the penalty.
   - The optimal solution involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach, which is not present in the code.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem statement. It merely counts the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters and prints that difference, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
