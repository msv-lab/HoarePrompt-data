You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a string `s` of length `k` using the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. It then prints the string `s` repeated a number of times based on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` is 1, it prints `s` repeated `n` times; otherwise, it prints `s` repeated `1` time if `n` is 1, or `2` times if `n` is greater than 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` formed from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets is a subsequence of `s`.
- The goal is to make the string `s` as short as possible.
- There can be multiple correct answers, and we can return any one of them.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **String Construction:**
   - It initializes an empty string `s`.
   - It then iterates from `97` to `k + 97` (which corresponds to ASCII values for the first `k` lowercase letters) and appends the corresponding characters to `s`. So, for `k=3`, `s` becomes `'abc'`.

3. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `n` repetitions of `s`. For example, if `n=2` and `k=1`, it prints `'aa'`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This expression evaluates to `2 * s` if `n != 1` and `1 * s` if `n == 1`.

### Correctness Check:

Let's consider the correctness of the program with the provided examples:

- **First Test Case (n=1, k=2):**
  - `s` becomes `'ab'`.
  - Since `n=1`, the program prints `'ab'`, which is correct.

- **Second Test Case (n=2, k=1):**
  - `s` becomes `'a'`.
  - Since `k=1`, the program prints `'aa'`, which is correct.

- **Third Test Case (n=2, k=2):**
  - `s` becomes `'ab'`.
  - Since `n=2`, the program prints `'abab'`, which is not correct. The expected output is `'baab'` or any other string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 from `'a'` and `'b'`.

- **Fourth Test Case (n=2, k=3):**
  - `s` becomes `'abc'`.
  - Since `n=2`, the program prints `'abcabc'`, which is not correct. The expected output is `'abcbac'` or any other string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 from `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the cases where `n > 1` and `k > 1`. It only constructs a simple repetition of the first `k` letters, which does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included.

Thus, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
