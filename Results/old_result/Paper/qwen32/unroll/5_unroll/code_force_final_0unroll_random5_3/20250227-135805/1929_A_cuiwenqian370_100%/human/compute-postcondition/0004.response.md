The code snippet initializes an empty list called `results`. None of the other variables (`array`, `data`, `t`, `index`) are affected by this code.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n (2 <= n <= 100), and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is one of the integers from the input; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
