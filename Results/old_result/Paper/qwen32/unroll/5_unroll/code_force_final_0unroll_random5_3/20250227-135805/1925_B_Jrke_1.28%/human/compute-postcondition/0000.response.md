The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates a number of times specified by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is related to the input value that `int(input())` will provide.

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. Given the context, this integer is `t`, which is the number of test cases and is already specified to be in the range 1 <= t <= 10^3.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range. Since `t` is already described as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, no further adjustment is needed for `t` itself, but we need to ensure that `int(input())` will return this value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3**
