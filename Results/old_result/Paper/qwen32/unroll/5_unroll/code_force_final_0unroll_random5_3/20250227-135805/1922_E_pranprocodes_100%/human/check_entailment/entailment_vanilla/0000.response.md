Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to generate an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Here are some key points:
- An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are in strictly increasing order.
- The array can have a length of at most 200.
- The elements of the array should be in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.
- If it's not possible to find such an array, we should output `-1`.

### Key Observations

1. **Binary Representation**: 
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the number of ways we can choose elements to form subsequences.
   - If we have an array with `n` elements where each element is either strictly less than or greater than its neighbors, the number of increasing subsequences can be related to powers of 2.
   - For example, if we have an array `[a, b, c]` where `a < b < c`, then the number of increasing subsequences is `2^3 - 1 = 7` (excluding the empty subsequence).

2. **Constructing the Array**:
   - To achieve exactly `X` increasing subsequences, we need to construct an array such that the number of subsequences matches `X`.
   - The provided program seems to try to achieve this by using a binary representation approach.

### Program Analysis

The program tries to construct the array based on the binary representation of `X`:
- It initializes `max` and `min` values to `100000000` and `-100000000`, respectively.
- It iterates while `X` is not equal to `1`, and at each step, it either appends `max` or `min` to the array `ans` based on whether `X` is even or odd.
- If `X` is even, it appends `max` and decrements `max`.
- If `X` is odd, it appends `min` and increments `min`.
- It then reverses the array and prints its length and elements.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Increasing Subsequences**:
   - The program does not correctly ensure that the array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The binary representation approach used does not guarantee that the resulting array will have the correct number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where it might be impossible to construct such an array (e.g., very large `X` values that cannot be represented by a sequence of length at most 200).

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not handle the case where it needs to output `-1` if it's impossible to find such an array.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the logic and handling of edge cases, the provided program is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
