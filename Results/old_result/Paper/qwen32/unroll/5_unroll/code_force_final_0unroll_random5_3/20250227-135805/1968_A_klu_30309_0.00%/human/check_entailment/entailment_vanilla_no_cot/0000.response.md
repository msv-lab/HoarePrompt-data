To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the function `func_1(x)` correctly identifies an integer `y` (where `1 â‰¤ y < x`) such that the value of `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.

Let's break down the logic of the function:

1. It starts from `y = x - 1` and iterates downwards to `y = 2`.
2. For each `y`, it checks if `x % y == 0`, which means `y` is a divisor of `x`.
3. If `y` is a divisor and `2 * y >= x`, it immediately returns `y`.
4. If no such `y` is found, it keeps track of the largest `y` that is a divisor of `x` and returns it at the end.

The logic seems to be based on the observation that if `y` is a divisor of `x` and `2 * y >= x`, then `gcd(x, y) = y` and `gcd(x, y) + y = 2 * y`, which is maximized. However, this logic is not entirely correct because there might be a non-divisor `y` that gives a higher value for `gcd(x, y) + y`.

Let's analyze the given example cases:

- For `x = 10`, the function returns `5` (which is a divisor and `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10`).
- For `x = 7`, the function returns `6` (which is not a divisor, but `gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7`).
- For `x = 21`, the function returns `18` (which is not a divisor, but `gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 24`).
- For `x = 100`, the function returns `98` (which is not a divisor, but `gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 198`).
- For `x = 2`, the function returns `1` (which is a divisor and `gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2`).
- For `x = 1000`, the function returns `750` (which is not a divisor, but `gcd(1000, 750) + 750 = 1750`).
- For `x = 6`, the function returns `3` (which is a divisor and `gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6`).

The function seems to work for the given examples, but it might not always return the optimal `y` for all possible values of `x`. For example, if `x = 15`, the function would return `10` (since `gcd(15, 10) + 10 = 15`), but the correct answer could be `12` (since `gcd(15, 12) + 12 = 17`).

Therefore, the function's logic is not fully reliable for all cases. It might work for some inputs but not for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
