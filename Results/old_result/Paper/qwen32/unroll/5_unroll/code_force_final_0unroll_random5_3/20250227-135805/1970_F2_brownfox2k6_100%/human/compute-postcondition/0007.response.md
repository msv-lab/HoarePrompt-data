Output State: **obj is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, where the second integer has been decreased by 1, and d is a string that can be 'U', 'L', or 'R', representing the direction of movement. The direction of movement d is 'L'.**

In simpler terms, the x-coordinate of the entity (the second element of the list `obj`) has been decreased by 1, while the y-coordinate (the first element of the list `obj`) and the direction `d` remain unchanged.
