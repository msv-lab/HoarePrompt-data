To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `inpstr` is a string containing the first line of the input, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` or 0 if 'B' is not present.
- `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` from the end or 0 if 'B' is not present.
- `outind` is 0 (though `outind` is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Length of `inpstr`**:
   - `inpstr` contains a single integer `t` as a string. Therefore, `len(inpstr)` is the number of characters in the string representation of `t`.

2. **Value of `ind1`**:
   - `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`. Since `inpstr` contains an integer `t` and not the character 'B', `ind1` will be 0.

3. **Value of `ind2`**:
   - `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` from the end. Since `inpstr` contains an integer `t` and not the character 'B', `ind2` will also be 0.

4. **Calculation of the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement calculates `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.
   - Substituting the values, we get: `len(inpstr) - 0 - 0`, which simplifies to `len(inpstr)`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the length of `inpstr`, which is the number of characters in the string representation of the integer `t`.

### Final Output:
Output: **length of `inpstr` (where `inpstr` is the string representation of the integer `t`)**
