Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to ensure that for each problem `i`, the difficulty `a_i` of the proposed problem does not exceed the expected difficulty `b_i`. We can insert new problems with difficulties `w` to achieve this, and each time we do, we remove the most difficult problem (the last in the sorted list) from the contest.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided code does not correctly implement the described logic for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Insertion and Sorting Logic**:
   - The code attempts to insert `b[j]` into `a` if `b[j] < a[i]`, but it does so inefficiently and incorrectly.
   - It removes the last element of `a` and then inserts `b[j]` at the `i`th position, which is not the correct way to simulate inserting a new problem and removing the most difficult one.
   - The list `a` is not being sorted after each insertion, which is necessary according to the problem statement.

2. **Logic for Incrementing Counters**:
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented every time `b[j] < a[i]`, but this does not accurately reflect the number of new problems added.
   - The logic for incrementing `i` and `j` is flawed. It should ensure that every `a_i` is less than or equal to the corresponding `b_i`.

3. **Unused Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program. It sorts the array in reverse order, which is not needed for this problem.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we should:
- Iterate through the lists `a` and `b`.
- If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, insert a new problem with difficulty `b[i]` and remove the most difficult problem (the last element in the sorted list).
- Sort the list `a` after each insertion.
- Count the number of insertions made.

### Correctness
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
