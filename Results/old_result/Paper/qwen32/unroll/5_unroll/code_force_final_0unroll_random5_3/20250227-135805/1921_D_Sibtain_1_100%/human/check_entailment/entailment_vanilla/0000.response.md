Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) by choosing \( n \) integers from the array \( b_i \) (renamed as \( c_i \) in the program) and arranging them to form the array \( c_i \).

### Strategy:
1. **Sorting**: To maximize the difference, one effective strategy is to pair the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( c \) and vice versa.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by sorting the array \( a \) in ascending order and the array \( c \) in descending order. It then iteratively selects the largest possible difference between elements of \( a \) and \( c \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Special Case Handling**: The program first checks if all elements in both arrays \( a \) and \( c \) are identical. If so, the maximum difference \( D \) is 0.
2. **Sorting**: The arrays \( a \) and \( c \) are sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively.
3. **Greedy Selection**: The program uses two pointers \( i \) and \( j \) to iterate through the arrays \( a \) and \( c \). For each element in \( a \), it calculates the potential differences with the current smallest and largest elements in \( c \) and selects the maximum difference.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the length of \( a \) is 1 separately to avoid unnecessary iterations.

### Correctness:
The program's approach is correct based on the problem's requirements. By sorting \( a \) in ascending order and \( c \) in descending order, and then greedily selecting the maximum possible differences, the program ensures that the total difference \( D \) is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \) and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
