### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to select an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and modify the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

Let's analyze the provided functions and their roles:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list up to a given index \( n \) are zero. It iterates through the list from index 0 to \( n-1 \) and returns `False` if any element is not zero. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list by applying the specified operation. It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) and, while the current element and its neighbors are non-zero, it modifies the elements according to the operation.
   - The operation inside the while loop is incorrect: `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` should be `list[i + 1] -= 1`, `list[i] -= 2`, and `list[i - 1] -= 1` respectively. The current implementation incorrectly multiplies the decrement by the value of `list[i - 1]`, which is not how the operation is defined.
   - After attempting to reduce the list, the function checks if all elements in the list are zero using `func_1`. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The key issue with the program is the incorrect implementation of the operation inside the while loop in `func_2`. This means that the program does not correctly simulate the intended operation, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Given the incorrect implementation of the operation, the program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.

**Correctness: False**
