Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any number that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to check if a single list is sorted. However, based on the execution summary, it seems that `func_1` is intended to check a list of lists, which is not the case here. The function `func_1` should only check if the single list `lst` is sorted.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop logic is flawed. The program tries to split numbers and check the list's sorted status, but the condition `if not func_1(list1)` is checked before attempting to split a number, and the logic for splitting numbers and adjusting the list is incorrect. The loop does not properly handle the case where multiple splits are needed, and it does not ensure that the list is fully sorted after all possible splits.

3. **No Proper Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program only attempts to split a number once per iteration and does not re-check the entire list after a split. This means that if a split creates a new number that needs to be split, this will not be handled.

4. **Incorrect Insertion of Digits**: The logic `list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)` and `list1.insert(p, a % 10)` is incorrect for splitting numbers. For example, if the number is 123, it should be split into 1, 2, and 3, but the current logic only handles two-digit numbers correctly.

5. **Output Case Insensitivity**: The program prints 'Yes' and 'No', which is correct, but the logic to determine the output is flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if the list can be sorted using the described operation.

Correctness: **False**
