The code snippet initializes a list `char_count` with 26 zeros, corresponding to the 26 lowercase Latin letters. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged as the code only affects `char_count`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.**
