Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers representing the numbers on the cards and an integer `k` representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.**
