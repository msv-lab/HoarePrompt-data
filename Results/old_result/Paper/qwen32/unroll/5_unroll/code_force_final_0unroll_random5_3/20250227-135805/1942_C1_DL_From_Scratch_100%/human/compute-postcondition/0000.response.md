The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of vertices remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5); `y` is 0; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
