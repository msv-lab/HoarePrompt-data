Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the solution to the problem described. The code only includes input reading functions (`func_1` to `func_5`) and does not contain any logic to solve the problem of rearranging the permutation and performing the binary search as specified. The program does not handle the test cases as described in the problem statement and does not produce any output, which is required for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
