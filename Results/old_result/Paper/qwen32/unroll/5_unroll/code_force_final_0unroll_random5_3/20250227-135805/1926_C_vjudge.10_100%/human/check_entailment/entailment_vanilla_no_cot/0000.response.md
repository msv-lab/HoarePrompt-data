Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n for each test case. It precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to the maximum possible value (2 * 10^5) and then uses this precomputed data to quickly answer each test case. This approach ensures that each test case can be handled within the 0.5-second time limit.
