Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, as described in the problem statement.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Total Possible Pairs**: There are `n * (n - 1) / 2` possible pairs of children.
2. **Friendship Values**: Initially, each pair of friends has a given friendship value. This value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen for an excursion.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to calculate the expected sum of the friendship values for all `k` excursions, expressed as a fraction `p/q` and then compute `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` is the modulus used for the final result.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs.
   - `s = 0` is the sum of the expected friendship values.
   - `a = 0` is used to accumulate the initial sum of friendship values of all friend pairs.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - For each of the `m` friend pairs, the program reads the pair indices and the initial friendship value, and adds the initial friendship value to `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Sum**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` is intended to calculate the expected sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.
   - Inside the loop, `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is used to update the sum `s`. However, this formula does not correctly compute the expected sum of the friendship values.

### Issues in the Program:
- The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. It does not correctly account for the incremental increase in friendship values over the `k` excursions.
- The correct approach involves calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum over `k` excursions, considering the probability of each pair being chosen and the incremental increase in their friendship values.

### Correct Approach:
- For each friend pair with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution to the total sum over `k` excursions is `f * (k + 1) / 2 + (k * (k - 1) / 2) * (1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.
- Summing this over all friend pairs and taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7` gives the correct answer.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly compute the expected sum of the friendship values as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
