Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who are interacting over a set of items with different prices for each of them. Alice aims to maximize her profit, while Bob tries to minimize it. The profit is calculated based on the prices Alice and Bob pay for the items they buy or take for free.

The key points to consider:
1. Alice can choose any subset of items to buy.
2. If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob can take all of them for free.
3. If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob can take `k` items for free and will buy the rest from Alice at Bob's prices.
4. Alice's profit is the difference between the sum of the prices Bob pays her and the sum of the prices Alice pays for the items.

### Code Analysis
Let's break down the code provided:

1. **Input Handling Functions:**
   - `func_1()` is supposed to read an integer from the input.
   - `func_2()` is supposed to read a line of integers from the input and return them as a map object.

2. **Profit Calculation Function:**
   - `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)` is supposed to calculate Alice's profit. However, the implementation does not seem correct based on the problem statement.

The current implementation of `func_3`:
- `sub_summ` is initialized to 0.
- It sums up all the values from `sec_arr`, which is not explained in the problem context.
- It then iterates over `main_ar` and adds the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` to `sub_summ` if their sum is non-negative.

### Issues in the Code
- The code does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
- The function `func_3` does not correctly calculate Alice's profit based on the problem's rules.
- There is no logic to handle the case where Alice buys fewer than `k` items or `k` or more items.
- The function `func_3` does not differentiate between the items Alice buys and the items Bob buys or takes for free.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Calculate the profit for each item as `b_i - a_i`.
2. Sort the items based on this profit in descending order.
3. If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob takes all for free, and Alice's profit is 0.
4. If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob takes `k` items with the highest profit for free, and Alice's profit is the sum of the profits of the remaining items.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the provided code, it is clear that the code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
