### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of each sign. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings, `data`, which contains all the numbers from the input.
   - The first element of `data` is the number of test cases, `T`.
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining periodicities.
   - For each periodicity `a[i]`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur after `last_year`. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which effectively finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - After processing all signs in a test case, `last_year` will be the year when the n-th sign occurs, and this value is added to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.

### Verification Against the Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
   - Calculation:
     - `last_year = 3` (first sign)
     - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4` (second sign)
     - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8` (third sign)
     - `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10` (fourth sign)
     - `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18` (fifth sign)
     - `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36` (sixth sign)
   - Output: `36`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Calculation:
     - `last_year = 1` (first sign)
     - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2` (second sign)
     - `next_year = (2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3` (third sign)
     - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4` (fourth sign)
     - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5` (fifth sign)
   - Output: `5`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `last_year = 1` (first sign)
     - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1` (second sign)
     - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1` (third sign)
     - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1` (fourth sign)
     - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1` (fifth sign)
   - Output: `5`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
   - Calculation:
     - `last_year = 50` (first sign)
     - `next_year = (50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60` (second sign)
     - `next_year = (60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 771` (third sign)
     - `next_year = (771 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 900` (fourth sign)
     - `next_year = (900 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1409` (fifth sign)
     - `next_year = (1409 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012` (sixth sign)
   - Output: `2012`

The program correctly calculates the year for each test case as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
