Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to perform the described operations on the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates over each index `i` from 1 to `n-2` (inclusive), and for each index, it performs the operation while `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation is incorrectly implemented:
     - The operation should decrement `list[i-1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i+1]` by 1.
     - However, the code incorrectly multiplies the decrements by `list[i-1]`, which is not how the problem specifies the operation should be performed.
   - After the loop, it checks if the first element is non-zero. If it is, it immediately prints 'no' and returns.
   - Finally, it uses `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Issues:
- The main issue with `func_2` is the incorrect implementation of the operation. The operation should simply decrement `list[i-1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i+1]` by 1, not multiply these decrements by `list[i-1]`.
- Another issue is that the function checks only the first element after the loop, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made entirely zero. It should use `func_1` directly after attempting all possible operations.
- The use of `print` statements within the function is not ideal for a function that should return a result, especially when multiple test cases are involved. It would be better to return 'YES' or 'NO' and handle the output outside the function.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect implementation of the operation and the improper checks, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
