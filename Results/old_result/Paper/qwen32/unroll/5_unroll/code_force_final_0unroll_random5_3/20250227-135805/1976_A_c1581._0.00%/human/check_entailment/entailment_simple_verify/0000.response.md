### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the original program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password:

1. **Condition 1: Password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.**
   - The problem statement specifies this, and the program does not explicitly handle this condition, but it assumes the input is valid (as per the problem statement).

2. **Condition 2: There should be no digit that comes after a letter.**
   - The program correctly handles this by iterating through the password and checking if a digit appears after a letter. If so, it returns "NO".
   - This is validated in the annotations where `last_digit_index` is used to track the last digit's position.

3. **Condition 3: All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.**
   - The program checks if the list of digits is sorted using `digits != sorted(digits)`.
   - This is validated in the annotations where it states that the list `digits` is sorted if this condition is not met.

4. **Condition 4: All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.**
   - Similarly, the program checks if the list of letters is sorted using `letters != sorted(letters)`.
   - This is validated in the annotations where it states that the list `letters` is sorted if this condition is not met.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case when the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly. However, the annotations and the code itself show that the program does handle these cases correctly:
- If the password consists only of digits, the `digits` list will be sorted, and the `letters` list will be empty, so the conditions are satisfied.
- If the password consists only of letters, the `letters` list will be sorted, and the `digits` list will be empty, so the conditions are satisfied.

The original assessment suggests adding explicit checks to handle these cases, but the current implementation implicitly handles them correctly due to the sorted checks and the nature of the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does correctly handle the cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
