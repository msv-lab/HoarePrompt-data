Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program's logic is based on a fixed condition that checks if the length of the array `c` is exactly 2, and if so, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2". For any other length of the array, it prints "13 0". This approach does not consider the actual values in the array or the MEX operation, which are crucial for determining the maximum sum of the array elements.

The correct solution involves calculating the MEX of different subarrays and performing the specified operation to maximize the sum of the array. The program should iterate through the array, compute the MEX for each possible subarray, and update the array elements accordingly to achieve the maximum sum. The provided program does none of this and simply outputs a hardcoded result based on the length of the array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
