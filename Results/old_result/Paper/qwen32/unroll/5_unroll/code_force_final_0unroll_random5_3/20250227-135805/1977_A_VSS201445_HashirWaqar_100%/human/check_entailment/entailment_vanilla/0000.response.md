Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if it's possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
2. **Key Observations**:
    - If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes you can have after `n` moves is `n` (if you add one cube each move).
    - If `n` is equal to or greater than `m`, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the net change in the number of cubes is always even. For example, if `n - m` is 2, it means we can add one cube and then add another cube to reach `m` from `m-2` (or remove one cube and then another to reach `m` from `m+2`).
3. **Logic in the Program**:
    - The program first reads the number of test cases.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
    - It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
    - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic derived from the observations. Therefore, it will correctly determine whether it's possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
