The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 for each test case. However, after executing this line, `n` will be assigned the value of the integer input provided, which could be any integer within the range 2 to 50 as per the precondition.

The variable `t` (the number of test cases) and the list `a` (which contains `n` integers) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, they retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the integer input provided (2 <= n <= 50); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.**
