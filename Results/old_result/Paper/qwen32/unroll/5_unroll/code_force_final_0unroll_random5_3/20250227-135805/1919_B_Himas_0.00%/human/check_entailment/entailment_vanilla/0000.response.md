Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum penalty for splitting a string `s` (consisting of '+' and '-') into non-empty subarrays. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray (where '+' contributes +1 and '-' contributes -1) multiplied by the length of the subarray. The goal is to minimize the total penalty across all subarrays.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` (which is not used in the program).
   - It then reads the string `e`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes `P` and `M` to 0. These variables are meant to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character `q` in the string `e`:
     - If `q` is '+', it increments `P`.
     - If `q` is '-', it increments `M`.
   - Finally, it prints the difference `P - M`.

### Issues with the Program

- **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**:
  - The program calculates `P - M` for each test case and prints it as the result. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the minimum penalty.
  - The correct approach involves finding an optimal way to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. This requires dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the best splits.
  
- **Unused Variable**:
  - The variable `s` (which is supposed to be the length of the string) is read but not used.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider different ways to split the array and calculate the penalty for each possible split. The optimal solution might involve dynamic programming, where we calculate the minimum penalty for each possible subarray ending at each position of the array.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not calculate the minimum penalty based on the rules provided. It simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' in the string, which is not relevant to the penalty calculation.

**Correctness: False**
