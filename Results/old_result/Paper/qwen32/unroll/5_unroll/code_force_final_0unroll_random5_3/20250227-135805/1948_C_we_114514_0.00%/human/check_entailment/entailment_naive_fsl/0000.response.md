Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for the robot's movement. Specifically, the logic for moving the robot and checking if it can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. The code does not account for the robot's ability to move up or down after its initial move and then follow the arrow in the new cell. The code only considers moving right along the arrows in the first row and then moving right along the arrows in the second row, which is not sufficient to cover all possible paths the robot can take.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
><<>
><<>
```
In this case, the robot can start at (1, 1), move left to (1, 0) (which is not possible, but let's consider the logical flow), then move right to (1, 1), then move down to (2, 1), then right to (2, 2), then up to (1, 2), then right to (1, 3), then down to (2, 3), then right to (2, 4). This path should result in "YES" because the robot can reach (2, 4). However, the given code will not recognize this path and will incorrectly output "NO".

The code needs to be modified to properly simulate the robot's movements according to the problem description, considering all possible moves (left, right, up, down) and following the arrows accordingly.
