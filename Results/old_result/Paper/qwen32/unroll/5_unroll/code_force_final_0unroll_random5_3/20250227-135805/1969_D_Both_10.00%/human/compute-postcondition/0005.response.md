Output State: **The program returns `sub_summ` which is the sum of the initial `sub_summ` and the sums of the elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is non-negative.**

This means that the final value returned is the result of adding the initial value of `sub_summ` to the sum of all non-negative sums of the tuples in `main_ar`.
