Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. However, the current implementation does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Splitting Strategy**: The program splits the string `s` by the character `'-'` and calculates the length of the resulting parts. This approach does not correspond to an optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty. The optimal strategy involves finding a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties of the resulting subarrays is minimized.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates a count of how many times the balance (sum of `+1` and `-1` values) goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This count does not represent the minimum penalty as described. The penalty is the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays multiplied by their lengths.

3. **Correct Approach**: To find the minimum penalty, one would need to consider all possible ways to split the array and calculate the total penalty for each split. An optimal approach might involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers the cumulative sum and possible splits to minimize the total penalty.

Given the above points, the current implementation does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
