Precondition: **Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), where a is the frequency of launching fireworks for the first installation, b is the frequency of launching fireworks for the second installation, and m is the time each firework is visible in the sky. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases.**
