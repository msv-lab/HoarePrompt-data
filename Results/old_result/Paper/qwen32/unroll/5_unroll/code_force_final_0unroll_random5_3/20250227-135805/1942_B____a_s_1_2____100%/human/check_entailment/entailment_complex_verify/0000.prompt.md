You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, a permutation p of length n is printed where each element p[i] is calculated as mex - a[i] starting from i = n-1 to i = 0, and mex is updated to be the minimum of its current value and p[i]. The value of t, n, and the list a remain unchanged across different test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints a permutation `p` of length `n` for each test case, where each element `p[i]` is determined by the formula `mex - a[i]`, starting from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`, and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged across different test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Recap
Farmer John provides an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
The task is to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` that satisfies this condition.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

### Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized to a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
   - `mex` is then updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

### Potential Issues
- The loop iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, which is not the natural way to construct a permutation based on the MEX condition.
- The `mex` is updated to the minimum value of `mex` and `p[i]`, which may not correctly maintain the MEX property for the constructed `p`.

### Testing the Program
Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Example 1
**Input**:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0 1 4 2 3 
0 1 2 3 4 
2 0 1 
```

#### Analysis of Example 1
- For the first test case, the output `0 1 4 2 3` seems correct.
- For the second test case, the output `0 1 2 3 4` is the identity permutation, which is valid.
- For the third test case, the output `2 0 1` is also valid.

However, let's consider a more complex edge case to ensure the program handles all scenarios correctly.

#### Edge Case
**Input**:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Expected Output**:
```
0 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**:
- For `i = 3`, `mex = 4`, `p[3] = 4 - 3 = 1`, `mex = min(4, 1) = 1`.
- For `i = 2`, `mex = 1`, `p[2] = 1 - 2 = -1`, `mex = min(1, -1) = -1` (Invalid as `p` should be a permutation of `0, 1, 2, 3`).

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly handle the MEX condition and may produce invalid permutations in certain cases. Specifically, the reverse iteration and the way `mex` is updated do not guarantee that `p` will be a valid permutation that satisfies the given condition for all possible inputs.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

The program fails to construct a valid permutation `p` for all potential cases, especially when the MEX value is not correctly maintained throughout the construction process.
