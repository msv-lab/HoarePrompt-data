You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n\) and \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix XOR:**
   The prefix XOR is calculated correctly, but the logic for counting valid tuples seems flawed. The code does not correctly use the prefix XOR to compute \(f(x, y)\), \(f(y, z)\), and \(f(x, z)\).

2. **Incorrect Use of Bitwise Operations:**
   The code attempts to use bitwise operations to count the number of valid tuples, but the logic for this is not correct. The nested loops and bitwise operations do not correctly reflect the required comparison \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

3. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Tuples:**
   The logic for counting valid tuples is not correctly implemented. The code seems to be attempting to use a prefix sum-like approach to count the number of valid tuples, but this approach is incorrect for the given problem.

4. **Debugging Statements:**
   The code contains debugging statements (`print` statements) that do not contribute to the correctness of the solution and should be removed.

### Example of Incorrectness:

For the input:
```
1
3
6 2 4
```

The correct output is `4`, but the provided program does not produce this output. The program seems to be using an incorrect approach to count the number of valid tuples.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve calculating the prefix XOR values and then iterating through all possible tuples (x, y, z) to check the condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(prefix[-1] ^ v)
    ans = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(x, n + 1):
            for z in range(y, n + 1):
                fx_y = prefix[y] ^ prefix[x - 1]
                fy_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[y - 1]
                fx_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[x - 1]
                if fx_y ^ fy_z > fx_z:
                    ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the number of valid tuples by iterating through all possible (x, y, z) and checking the condition. However, this approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\), which is not efficient for large inputs (as specified in the problem description).

Given the issues in the provided program and the need for a more efficient solution, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
