To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and understand how it processes the input values. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - `n` is the length of the list `p`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` with the condition that no integer `i` is at position `i` in the list.
   - The inner `while` loop iterates over the list `l` (which is the same as `p` in the problem description).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `l[i]` is equal to `i + 2` and the next element `l[i + 1]` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - If this condition is met, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it prints `3`.

Given the conditions, we can infer the following:
- The loop will print `2` if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in the list such that the first element is `i + 2` and the second element is `i + 1`.
- If no such pair is found, it will print `3`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of the lists `p` for each test case, we cannot determine the exact output for each test case. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the possible outputs for each test case.

Output State: **For each test case, the output will be either `2` or `3` based on the presence of the specific pair `(i + 2, i + 1)` in the list. The state of `t`, `n`, and `p` remains unchanged except for the output printed for each test case.**

However, if we need to strictly follow the format and provide a generalized output state, we can say:

Output State: **For each test case, the output will be either `2` or `3`.**
