a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. b is a list of strings where each string represents a row in the field, and each row contains M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where M is the number of columns in the field, 3 <= M <= 99, and M is odd. Each pair of characters can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0" to "R9" or "B0" to "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, or ".Q" for the Quaffle. The list b is followed by an integer T (0 <= T <= 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, and T lines each containing an action as described in the problem statement.
