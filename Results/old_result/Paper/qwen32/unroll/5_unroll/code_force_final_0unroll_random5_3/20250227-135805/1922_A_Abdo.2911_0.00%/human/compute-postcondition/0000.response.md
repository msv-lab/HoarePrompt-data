The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
