The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list `out`. No other variables are affected or modified by this code. Therefore, the initial state remains largely unchanged except for the addition of the `out` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7; `num` is a string read from input; `out` is an empty list.**
