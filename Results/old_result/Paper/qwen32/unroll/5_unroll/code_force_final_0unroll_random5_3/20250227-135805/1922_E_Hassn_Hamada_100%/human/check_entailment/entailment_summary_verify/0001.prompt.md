You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns the tuple (0, 0).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`, which is the number of increasing subsequences required.

2. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - The program calls the function `func_1` with `n-1` and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences required.
   - The function uses a loop to determine the size of the sequence and the value to append to the sequence.
   - The function recursively calls itself to adjust the number of subsequences until the required number is achieved.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence.
   - It then prints the sequence itself.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the logic inside the function is not clearly explained or correct for achieving this goal.
   - The function uses bitwise operations and conditions that do not seem to directly relate to generating an increasing subsequence with the exact count `X`.
   - The base case `if number == 0: return (0, 0)` does not contribute to the sequence generation.
   - The loop and conditions inside `func_1` do not ensure that the sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Sequence Generation Logic**:
   - The logic to generate the sequence is flawed. It does not ensure that the sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence generated by the function does not seem to follow any clear pattern that guarantees the exact count of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output**:
   - The output of the program does not match the expected output for the given examples.
   - The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to generate such a sequence (it should return `-1`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic inside `func_1` is flawed and does not ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences. The program also does not handle the case where it is impossible to generate such a sequence.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
