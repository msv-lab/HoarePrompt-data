The provided code snippet is a function definition, but it does not contain any executable code that would change the initial state of the variables. The function `Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y` is defined, but it is not executed. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**
