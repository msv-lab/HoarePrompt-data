Precondition: **Each test case contains integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m (0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)), and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions respectively. The next m lines contain three integers each: a_i, b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) representing a pair of friends and f_i (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9) representing their initial friendship value. All pairs of friends are distinct. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
