To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`. This implies that the loop will execute based on the value of `test_cases`.

### Analysis:
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, a)`.
- The loop head uses `range(test_cases)`, which expects an integer, but `test_cases` is a list.

### Adjustment:
- The `range()` function requires an integer argument representing the number of iterations. Therefore, we need to adjust `test_cases` to be the number of test cases in the list, not the list itself.
- Let's denote the number of test cases as `num_test_cases`. This should be the length of the `test_cases` list.

### Corrected State:
- `test_cases` should be the number of test cases, i.e., `num_test_cases`.
- `results` is an empty list and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`test_cases` is the number of test cases (an integer), `results` is an empty list**.

To make it more precise:

State: **`test_cases` is `num_test_cases` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `results` is an empty list**.
