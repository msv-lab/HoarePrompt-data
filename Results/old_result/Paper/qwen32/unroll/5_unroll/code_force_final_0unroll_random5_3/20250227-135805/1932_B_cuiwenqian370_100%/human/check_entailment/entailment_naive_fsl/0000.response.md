Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and why it works:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs after the last year and at a multiple of its periodicity.
   - It updates `last_year` to this new year.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as:
- When all signs have the same periodicity.
- When the periodicities are different and vary widely.
- When the number of signs `n` is 1, which means only one sign needs to be considered.

The example inputs provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program, and no potential edge cases or incorrect scenarios were identified. Therefore, the program is correct.
