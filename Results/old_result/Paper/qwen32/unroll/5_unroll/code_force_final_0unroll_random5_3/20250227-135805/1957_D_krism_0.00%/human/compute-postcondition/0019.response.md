Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but is expected to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `a`, and the list `a` itself which contains `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values in the list `a`.**
