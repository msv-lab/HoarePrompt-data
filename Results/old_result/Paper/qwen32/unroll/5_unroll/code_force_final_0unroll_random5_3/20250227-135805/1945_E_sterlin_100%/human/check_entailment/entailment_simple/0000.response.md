### Reasoning:

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found using a modified binary search. The goal is to ensure that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will correctly identify `x` as `p_l` at the end of the search.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p`.

2. **Mapping Indices**:
   - It creates a dictionary `num_indx` that maps each number in `p` to its index (1-based).

3. **Binary Search Preparation**:
   - It initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n`.
   - It performs a binary search on `p` to find the position where `x` would be located if `p` were sorted.

4. **Determining Swaps**:
   - If `p[left]` equals `x`, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not seen during the binary search, it swaps `p[left]` with `x` (i.e., it places `x` at the position where `p[left]` was).
   - If `x` is seen but `p[left]` is not `x`, it performs two swaps:
     - First, it finds an unseen number and places `x` at its position.
     - Then, it places `x` at the `left` position.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of swaps performed and the indices of the elements involved in the swaps.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already at the correct position (`p[left] == x`), requiring 0 swaps.
- If `x` is not seen during the binary search, it correctly identifies the need for 1 swap to place `x` at the `left` position.
- If `x` is seen but `p[left]` is not `x`, it correctly identifies the need for 2 swaps to place `x` at the `left` position.

The program adheres to the problem constraints and correctly implements the logic to ensure that after at most 2 swaps, the binary search will correctly identify `x` as `p_l`.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: True**
