Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1` is defined after it is used**: The function `func_1` is called before its definition, which will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Handling of Quaffle**: The program does not properly handle the Quaffle's position. The Quaffle should move to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, but the program does not update the Quaffle's position in the `players` dictionary.

3. **Incorrect goal scoring logic**: The program checks if the player's position is in the goals list, but it does not account for the player carrying the Quaffle. The Quaffle must be with the player for a goal to be scored.

4. **Printing the correct team's goal**: The program prints the correct team's goal based on the player's position, but it does not account for the player carrying the Quaffle. If a player scores in their own goal, the other team should be credited with the point.

Here is a revised version of the program that addresses these issues:
```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle = None  # To keep track of who is carrying the Quaffle

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle = (x, y)  # Initial position of the Quaffle
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        if mo[0] == quaffle:
            quaffle = func_1(quaffle, mouvements[mo[1]])
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        if players[mo[0]] == quaffle:
            quaffle = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quaffle == mo[0]:
            if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                if mo[0][0] == 'R':  # mo[0] is a red player
                    pointsb += 1
                    print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                else:  # mo[0] is a blue player
                    pointsr += 1
                    print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            # Move the Quaffle to the middle of the field
            quaffle = ((m + 1) // 2 - 1, (n + 1) // 2 - 1)

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```
This revised program correctly handles the Quaffle's position, checks if the player carrying the Quaffle is at a goal, and correctly updates the score based on which team's goal is scored.
