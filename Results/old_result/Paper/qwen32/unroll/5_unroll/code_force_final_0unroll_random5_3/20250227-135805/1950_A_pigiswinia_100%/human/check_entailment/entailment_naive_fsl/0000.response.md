Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's the breakdown:

- It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR".
- It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK".
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it outputs "NONE".

The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the given constraints (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9) and correctly categorizes them into "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
