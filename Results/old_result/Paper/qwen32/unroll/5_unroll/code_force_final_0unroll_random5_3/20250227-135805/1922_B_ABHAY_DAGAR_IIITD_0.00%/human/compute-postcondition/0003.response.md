The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, which is used to iterate over the `results` list. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. The initial state of `results` being a list containing the calculated results for each test case does not inherently prevent the loop from executing, but to ensure the loop executes, we must confirm that `results` has at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list containing the calculated results for each test case and must have at least one element, `test_cases` remains unchanged**
