### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed explanation of the logic behind the program and seems to be correct in its reasoning. However, there is an issue with the annotated code and the state descriptions provided, which might lead to confusion.

Let's break down the code and the annotations to ensure correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in the containers `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1(nums)`:**
   - **Calculate Total and Mean:**
     - `total = sum(nums)`: This correctly calculates the total amount of water in the current test case.
     - `mean = total // n`: This correctly calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - **Check Cumulative Difference:**
     - `curr` is initialized to 0.
     - The loop iterates through each container, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
     - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means there is not enough water in the previous containers to balance out the deficit in the current container, so it returns 'NO'.
     - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

The logic is based on the idea that if the cumulative difference `curr` never goes negative, it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers end up with the mean amount of water.

### Issues with the Annotations:

The annotations provided have some inaccuracies:
- **State Description Before Function Call:**
  - The annotation incorrectly states that `nums` is a list of lists. In reality, `nums` is a list of integers representing the water amounts for a single test case.
- **State Description Inside Function:**
  - The annotation incorrectly states that `nums` is a list of lists inside `func_1(nums)`. It should be a list of integers.
  - The annotation also incorrectly states that `n` is the number of test cases in `nums`. In reality, `n` is the number of containers in the current test case.

### Conclusion:

The logic of the program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided in the original assessment. The annotations have some inaccuracies but do not affect the correctness of the logic itself.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
