To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the given loop and the conditions provided.

The loop iterates over each test case in `nums`. For each test case, it calculates the difference between the sum of the elements in the test case and the `mean`. This difference is added to `curr`. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the function immediately returns 'NO'.

Given that the sum of all integers within all inner lists of `nums` is perfectly divisible by `n`, and `mean` is the integer value of this total sum divided by `n`, the sum of the elements in each test case minus the `mean` should balance out to zero across all test cases. This means that the positive and negative differences should cancel each other out, keeping `curr` from going negative.

If `curr` does not go negative during any iteration, the loop completes all iterations without returning 'NO'. Therefore, the final value of `curr` should be 0, as the positive and negative differences balance out.

Since the problem does not specify any changes to `nums`, `total`, or `mean`, these variables remain unchanged. The only variable that changes within the loop is `curr`, which should be 0 after the loop completes.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. `total` is the sum of all integers within all inner lists of `nums`. `mean` is the integer value of `total` divided by `n`. `curr` is 0.**
