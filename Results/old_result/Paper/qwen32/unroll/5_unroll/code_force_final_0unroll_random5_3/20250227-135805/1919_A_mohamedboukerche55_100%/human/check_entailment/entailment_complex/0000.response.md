To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the game rules and the strategy that the program uses to determine the winner.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Game Mechanics**: 
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - Each player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins) loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key observation is that the game essentially revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation:
- **Even Total Coins (`a + b` is even)**:
  - If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure that he is the one to make the last move.
  - For instance, if Alice swaps wallets, Bob also swaps. If Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. This way, Bob ensures that Alice is the one who faces a situation where both wallets have 0 coins, making Alice lose.

- **Odd Total Coins (`a + b` is odd)**:
  - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob to face the even total situation after her first move.
  - Alice can start by swapping if `a` and `b` are unequal, or not swapping if they are equal. This ensures that after her move, the remaining coins are even, putting Bob in the losing position as per the previous point.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of coins (`a + b`). If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", and if the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy derived from the game mechanics.

**Correctness: True**
