The code snippet initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `arr` or `data` as they remain unchanged. The only variable that is modified is `index`, which is set to 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 0.**
