Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of distributing bets in a game such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`.

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b` by using the formula `|a * b| / gcd(a, b)`. The `gcd` function computes the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2(numbers)`**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers by iteratively applying the `func_1` function. It starts with the first element of the list and then computes the LCM of the current result with the next element in the list. The final result is the LCM of all elements in the list.

3. **Main Program**: For each test case, the program reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`. It then calculates the LCM `m` of the multipliers using `func_2`. The program then distributes the bets by dividing `m` by each multiplier `k_i` to get the bet `c_i` for the i-th outcome. If the sum of all bets `c_i` is less than `m`, the program outputs the bets; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

However, there is a mistake in the comments and the explanation of `func_2`. The comments state that `func_2` returns the sum of all elements in the list, but it actually returns the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in the list. This is consistent with the implementation of `func_2` and the use of `func_1` to compute the LCM.

The logic of the program is correct in terms of using the LCM to distribute the bets. The LCM ensures that each bet `c_i = m // k_i` is an integer, and the sum of the bets is strictly less than `m` because `m` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all `k_i`.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
