Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic implemented in the program is flawed.

The program calculates the sum of differences between each non-zero element and the last element of the list. However, this does not accurately reflect the feasibility of redistributing water such that all containers have the same amount. The correct approach involves checking if, at any point while iterating through the containers, the cumulative sum of water up to that point can be evenly distributed among the containers seen so far.

A correct solution would involve iterating through the list of containers, maintaining a running sum of the water in the containers and checking if this running sum can be evenly divided by the number of containers processed so far. If at any point the running sum is not divisible by the number of containers, it means that it is impossible to distribute the water evenly up to that point, and the answer should be "NO".

Given the current logic, the program will incorrectly determine the possibility of equal distribution of water in the containers.

Correctness: **False**
