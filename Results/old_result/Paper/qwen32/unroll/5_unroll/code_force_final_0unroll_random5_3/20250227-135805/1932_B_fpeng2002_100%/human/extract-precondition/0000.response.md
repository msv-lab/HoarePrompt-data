Precondition: **The function takes no input parameters directly but will be provided with input through standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is given at the beginning of the input.**
