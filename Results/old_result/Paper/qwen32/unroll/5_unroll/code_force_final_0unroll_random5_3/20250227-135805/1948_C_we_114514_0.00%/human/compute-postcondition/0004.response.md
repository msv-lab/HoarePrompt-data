Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether a certain condition is met based on the characters in `row1` and `row2`.**
