Reasoning:  
The provided Python program contains a few issues that lead to incorrect behavior based on the problem description. Here are the key points:

1. **Global Variable `soma`**: The variable `soma` is used to accumulate the sum of digits across all test cases. However, `soma` should be reset to 0 for each test case to ensure that the sum from one test case does not affect the next.

2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: The outer loop should iterate `N` times, where `N` is the number of test cases. Inside this loop, `soma` should be reset for each test case.

3. **Range of Inner Loop**: The inner loop should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive), not from 0 to `n-1`. This is because the problem description specifies that the integers from 1 to `n` are written on the board.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    soma = 0
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

Since the original program does not correctly handle the test cases as described, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
