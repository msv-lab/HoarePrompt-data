To determine the output state, we need to analyze the loop and how it modifies the variables. Here's the loop in question:

```python
for i in range(size - overlap):
    sequence.append(i + overlap)
```

Given the initial state:
- `number` is 10
- `sequence` is [3, 5, 2]
- `size_overlap` is (3, 0)
- `size` is 3
- `overlap` is 0

Let's break down the loop:
- `size - overlap` is `3 - 0`, which equals 3.
- The loop will iterate 3 times, with `i` taking values 0, 1, and 2.
- In each iteration, `i + overlap` (which simplifies to `i` since `overlap` is 0) is appended to the `sequence`.

Let's go through each iteration:
1. When `i` is 0, `0 + 0` (which is 0) is appended to `sequence`. So, `sequence` becomes [3, 5, 2, 0].
2. When `i` is 1, `1 + 0` (which is 1) is appended to `sequence`. So, `sequence` becomes [3, 5, 2, 0, 1].
3. When `i` is 2, `2 + 0` (which is 2) is appended to `sequence`. So, `sequence` becomes [3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 2].

The variables `number`, `size_overlap`, `size`, and `overlap` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **number is 10, sequence is [3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 2], size_overlap is (3, 0), size is 3, overlap is 0.**
