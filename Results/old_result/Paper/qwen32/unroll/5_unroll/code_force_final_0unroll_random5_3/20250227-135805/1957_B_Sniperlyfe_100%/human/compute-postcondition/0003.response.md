To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the values of `i` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will start with `i` initialized to 1 and will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1, the loop will not execute because the range `range(1, 1)` is empty.

3. **Initial State of `i`**: The loop initializes `i` to 1, so we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts. The state of `i` before the loop starts is irrelevant to the loop's execution, as it is set within the loop head.

4. **Adjust `n`**: To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1. The initial state given is `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, so we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

5. **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `k`, and `nums` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are part of the initial state provided.

Given the above reasoning, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n` zeros with `nums[0]` set to `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1`. `k` is decreased by `nums[0]`.**
