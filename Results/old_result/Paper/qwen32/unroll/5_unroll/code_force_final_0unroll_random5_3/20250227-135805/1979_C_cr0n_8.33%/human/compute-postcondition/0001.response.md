The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
