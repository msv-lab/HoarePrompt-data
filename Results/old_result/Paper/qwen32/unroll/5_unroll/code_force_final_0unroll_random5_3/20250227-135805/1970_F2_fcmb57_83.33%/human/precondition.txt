This problem does not match the provided function definition `def add(a, b):`. The function definition seems irrelevant to the problem description provided. However, based on the problem description, the input variables can be described as follows: N and M are integers representing the dimensions of the field where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented by a 2D list (or list of lists) of strings, where each string is either "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". There are P players for each team (1 ≤ P ≤ 10) and exactly one Quaffle, which can optionally be accompanied by one Bludger. T is an integer representing the number of steps in the game (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000). The subsequent T lines describe actions taken by entities in the field, where each action is a string containing a pair of characters representing the entity and a character or string representing the action.
