You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of children, pairs of friends with their initial friendship values, and a number of excursions. It calculates and prints a result based on these inputs, specifically the value of `s % M` after performing certain computations involving the number of children, pairs of friends, their friendship values, and the number of excursions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines follow, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Outputs**:
   - For each test case, the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the expected value in its simplest form.

### Program Analysis
The program attempts to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: The modulus value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`: The modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children. This is used to compute the probability of selecting any specific pair of children.
   - `s = 0`: This will store the sum of the expected friendship values.
   - `a = 0`: This will store the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

2. **Processing Friendships**:
   - The program iterates over the `m` pairs of friends and sums their initial friendship values into `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Sum**:
   - The program then iterates `k` times, each time updating `s` with a formula that seems incorrect based on the problem description.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to update `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a specific pair and the increase in friendship value over `k` excursions.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: The program uses modular arithmetic correctly for the modulus `M`, but the formula itself is flawed.

### Correct Approach
To correctly compute the expected value, we need to consider:
- The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions is `k * (k + 1) / 2` (since the friendship value increases by 1 each time it is selected).
- The expected value for each pair of friends is their initial value plus the expected increase.
- The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs, weighted by their probability of being selected.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
