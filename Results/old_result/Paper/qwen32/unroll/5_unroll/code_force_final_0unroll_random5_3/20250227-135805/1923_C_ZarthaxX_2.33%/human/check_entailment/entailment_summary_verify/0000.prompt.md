You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and `q`, an array `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function determines for each query whether a specific condition is met within the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for checking if a subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that meets the conditions is flawed.

Let's analyze the logic in the program:

1. **Condition 1**: The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of array `b`.
2. **Condition 2**: Each element in the subarray should be different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. **Condition 3**: All elements in `b` should be positive.

The program calculates `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` to determine if the subarray can be transformed into `b`. However, the logic used to check these conditions is incorrect.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
1
5 1
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
YES
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
- The subarray is `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`.
- We can create array `b` as `[2, 1, 2, 3, 6]`.
- The sum of both arrays is `13`.
- Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
- All elements in `b` are positive.

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs `NO` because its logic does not correctly determine that a valid `b` can be constructed for this subarray.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
- The logic `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not accurately check if a valid `b` can be constructed.
- The program does not correctly account for the possibility of transforming the subarray into `b` while satisfying all conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
