Let's carefully analyze the program and the given function summary to verify the correctness of the solution. We'll follow the steps outlined in the task and provide a detailed reasoning.

### Problem Analysis Recap
The problem requires determining if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is "good" based on the following conditions:
1. The sum of the subarray equals the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. Each element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

### Key Observations Recap
- The smallest possible sum of `b` with length `m` is `m` (when all elements are 1).
- For a subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray must be at least `m` (the length of the subarray).
- If the subarray contains any element `1`, we can decrease it to `2` in `b` and decrease the sum of `b` by `1` while keeping the sum of `a` unchanged. Thus, we need `sum(subarray) - (number of 1s in the subarray) >= length of the subarray`.

### Program Analysis
The program constructs two prefix arrays:
- `ones[i]` which is the count of `1`s in the subarray from index `1` to `i`.
- `sum[i]` which is the sum of the subarray from index `1` to `i` minus the number of elements in the subarray (essentially, the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray).

For each query, it calculates:
- `onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`: the number of `1`s in the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]`.
- `sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`: the adjusted sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]`.

The condition checked is:
- `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`
- This simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`, or `sumInRange - onesInRange >= r - l + 1`.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary correctly describes the logic of `func_1`:
- It processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `q`, the array `c`, and the queries.
- It calculates the prefix arrays `ones` and `sum`.
- For each query, it checks if the adjusted sum condition is met and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Code Review
Let's verify the logic in the code:
1. **Prefix Array Calculation:**
   - `ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`: This correctly counts the number of `1`s up to index `i`.
   - `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`: This correctly calculates the adjusted sum up to index `i`.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`.
   - The condition `sumInRange - onesInRange >= r - l + 1` is checked. This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of `1`s is at least the length of the subarray, which is necessary for the subarray to be "good".

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
