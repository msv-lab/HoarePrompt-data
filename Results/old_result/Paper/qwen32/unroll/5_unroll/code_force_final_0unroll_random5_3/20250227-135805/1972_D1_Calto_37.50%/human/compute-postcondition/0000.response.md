In the provided `while` loop statement:

```
while b:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `b` is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, and a zero integer is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the initial state where `a` and `b` are positive integers, `b` is already a non-zero integer. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop executes at least once.

State: **a and b are positive integers**
