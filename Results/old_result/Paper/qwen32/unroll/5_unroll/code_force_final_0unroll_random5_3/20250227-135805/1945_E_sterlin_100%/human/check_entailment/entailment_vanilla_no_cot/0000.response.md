Correctness: **False**

The provided code snippets (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) are utility functions for reading input, but they do not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires implementing a strategy to rearrange the permutation using at most two swaps so that the binary search algorithm will correctly identify the position of `x`. The provided code does not include any logic for performing these swaps or for implementing the binary search that checks if the permutation is correctly set up. Therefore, the program is incomplete and incorrect based on the problem description.
