You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

        print(*p)
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, a permutation p of length n is printed where each element p[i] is calculated as mex - a[i] starting from i = n-1 to i = 0, and mex is updated to be the minimum of its current value and p[i]. The value of t, n, and the list a remain unchanged across different test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it accurately reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the problem's description.

### Problem Recap:
- Given an integer array `a` of length `n`, we need to find a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` such that `a[i] = MEX(p[0], p[1], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- The program is supposed to output any valid permutation `p` for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The given program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order and calculates the permutation `p` in the following way:
1. It initializes `mex` to `n` (which is the highest possible value for MEX initially).
2. For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
3. It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's examine if the algorithm correctly constructs the permutation `p`:
- The key point here is how the `mex` is updated. The `mex` should always be the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in `p`.
- By iterating backwards and updating `mex` to the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`, the program ensures that `mex` always reflects the smallest integer not yet used in `p` up to that point.
- This approach correctly calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, which is consistent with the problem's definition of `a[i]`.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the first test case from the problem statement:
- `n = 5`
- `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`

1. Initialize `mex = 5`.
2. For `i = 4`, `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
3. For `i = 3`, `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
4. For `i = 2`, `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
5. For `i = 1`, `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
6. For `i = 0`, `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.

The resulting `p` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the example output.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the array `a`.
