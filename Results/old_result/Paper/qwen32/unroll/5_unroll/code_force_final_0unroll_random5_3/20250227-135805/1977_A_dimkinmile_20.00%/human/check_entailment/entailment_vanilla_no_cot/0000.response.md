Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in `func_1()` is flawed because it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to determine if the exact number of cubes `m` can be achieved.

The correct condition should be that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the total number of moves (`n`) must be able to account for the difference (`m`) by adding and removing cubes in pairs. If the difference is odd, it is impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1()`:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and that `n` is at least `m` (since you cannot have more cubes than moves).
