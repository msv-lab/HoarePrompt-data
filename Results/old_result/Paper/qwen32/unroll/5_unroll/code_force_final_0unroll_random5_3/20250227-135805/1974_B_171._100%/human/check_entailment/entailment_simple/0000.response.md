**Reasoning:**

The provided program correctly implements the decoding process described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The function `func_1(encoded)` is responsible for decoding the encoded string `b`.
   - It first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart (i.e., the character at the mirrored position from the end of `r`).
   - Using this mapping, it decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped counterpart.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded string for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the program prints each decoded string.

The program correctly handles the constraints and performs the decoding as required. The use of a dictionary for the mapping ensures efficient character replacement during the decoding process.

**Correctness: True**
