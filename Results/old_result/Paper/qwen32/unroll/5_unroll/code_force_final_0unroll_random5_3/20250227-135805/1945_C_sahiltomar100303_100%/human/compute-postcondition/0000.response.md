Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial conditions for each test case (n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1') remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms: The variable `t` now holds the integer value of the user's input. All other initial conditions for the test cases remain the same.
