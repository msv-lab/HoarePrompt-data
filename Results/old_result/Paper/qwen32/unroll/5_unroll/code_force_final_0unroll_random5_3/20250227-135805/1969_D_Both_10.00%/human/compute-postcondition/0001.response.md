The only object in the loop head is the variable `val_a`, which iterates over `sec_arr`. For the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one tuple. The state of `main_ar` and `sub_summ` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers; `sec_arr` must have at least one tuple; `sub_summ` is 0**
