Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires finding the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems such that their total difficulty sums up to `x`. The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of these `n` sub-problems.

### Analysis of the Program
The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. It reads the values of `x` and `n`.
2. It calculates the integer division `k = x // n` which represents the average difficulty of the sub-problems.
3. If `k` is 1, it directly prints 1 because the only way to split `x` into `n` parts is if each part has a difficulty of 1.
4. Otherwise, it finds the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` and prints it as the answer.

### Correctness of the Program
The key idea here is to find the largest possible divisor of `x` that can be used as the difficulty of the sub-problems, ensuring that the number of sub-problems `n` can accommodate this difficulty without exceeding the total difficulty `x`.

#### Key Points:
- **GCD Insight**: The maximum possible balance (GCD) of the sub-problems' difficulties is a divisor of `x`.
- **Feasibility**: The divisor must be such that it can be used to form `n` sub-problems without exceeding the total difficulty `x`. This is ensured by the condition that the divisor must be less than or equal to `x // n` (average difficulty per sub-problem).

#### Verification with Examples:
1. **Test Case 1**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - `k = 10 // 3 = 3`
   - The largest divisor of 10 that is ≤ 3 is 2.
   - Possible sub-problems: [4, 2, 4] (GCD = 2)
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - `k = 5 // 5 = 1`
   - Since `k` is 1, the only possible sub-problems are [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (GCD = 1)
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - `k = 420 // 69 = 6`
   - The largest divisor of 420 that is ≤ 6 is 6.
   - Possible sub-problems: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] (GCD = 6)
   - Output: 6 (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) by identifying the largest feasible divisor of `x` that can be used to form `n` sub-problems without exceeding `x`.

Correctness: **True**
