### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b1, b2, ..., bk` such that their concatenation equals the original array `a`.**
2. **Calculate the penalty for each subarray `bi` as `|sum(bi)| * len(bi)`.**
3. **Find the minimum possible total penalty.**

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. **Reads the input and processes each test case.**
2. **Splits the string `s` by `'-'` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts.**
3. **Calls `func_1` with the original string and the calculated length.**

The function `func_1`:
1. **Iterates through each character in the string.**
2. **Maintains a `balance` that increases with `'+'` and decreases with `'-'`.**
3. **Counts the number of times the `balance` goes negative and resets it to zero.**
4. **Adds 1 to the count if the `balance` is positive at the end of the loop.**

#### Key Issues in the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Understanding of the Splitting Logic**: The original assessment claims that the program splits the string by `'-'`, which is not the core issue. The issue is the logic for optimal splitting based on the balance of `'+'` and `'-'`.
2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not calculate the penalty as described in the problem statement. However, it does not fully explain why the function's logic is incorrect.
3. **Lack of Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not implement an optimal strategy for splitting the string to minimize the total penalty.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This does not reflect the actual penalty calculation as described in the problem statement. The function does not consider the length of the subarrays or the sum of their elements.
- **Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The program does not consider all possible splits and calculate the penalties accordingly. An optimal strategy would involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the minimum penalty.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
10
--+++++++-
```
The optimal split would be:
- `b1 = [-1, -1]` with penalty `|sum(b1)| * len(b1) = 2 * 2 = 4`
- `b2 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with penalty `|sum(b2)| * len(b2) = 7 * 0 = 0`
- `b3 = [-1]` with penalty `|sum(b3)| * len(b3) = 1 * 1 = 1`
- `b4 = [1, 1]` with penalty `|sum(b4)| * len(b4) = 2 * 0 = 0`

The total penalty would be `4 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5`, but the provided program does not yield this result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program does not implement an optimal strategy for splitting the string and calculating the penalties. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
