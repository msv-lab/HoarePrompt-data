To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it accurately reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the problem's description.

### Problem Recap:
- Given an integer array `a` of length `n`, we need to find a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` such that `a[i] = MEX(p[0], p[1], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- The program is supposed to output any valid permutation `p` for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The given program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order and calculates the permutation `p` in the following way:
1. It initializes `mex` to `n` (which is the highest possible value for MEX initially).
2. For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
3. It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's examine if the algorithm correctly constructs the permutation `p`:
- The key point here is how the `mex` is updated. The `mex` should always be the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in `p`.
- By iterating backwards and updating `mex` to the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`, the program ensures that `mex` always reflects the smallest integer not yet used in `p` up to that point.
- This approach correctly calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, which is consistent with the problem's definition of `a[i]`.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the first test case from the problem statement:
- `n = 5`
- `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`

1. Initialize `mex = 5`.
2. For `i = 4`, `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
3. For `i = 3`, `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
4. For `i = 2`, `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
5. For `i = 1`, `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
6. For `i = 0`, `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.

The resulting `p` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the example output.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
