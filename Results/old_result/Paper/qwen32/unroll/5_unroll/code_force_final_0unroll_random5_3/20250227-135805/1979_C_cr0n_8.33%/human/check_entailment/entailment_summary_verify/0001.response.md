Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. If such a distribution is possible, the program should output the distribution; otherwise, it should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, it calculates `vprod[i] = prod // k_i`, which is the product of all multipliers except `k_i`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den <= 0`, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the coins as required.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - If `den > 0`, it prints the values in `vprod`.

### Verification of Logic
The logic of the program is based on the following idea:
- The sum of `vprod` represents the total amount bet if we distribute the coins as `vprod`.
- For each outcome, the amount received back is `k_i * vprod[i] = prod`.
- To ensure that the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) is less than the amount received back for each outcome, we need `prod > sum(vprod)`.
- This condition is equivalent to `prod - sum(vprod) > 0`, which is checked by the program.

### Edge Cases
- **All `k_i` are equal:** In this case, `prod - sum(vprod)` will be `0`, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **`k_i` values vary:** The program ensures that the distribution is feasible by checking if `prod - sum(vprod) > 0`.

### Detailed Analysis
Let's delve deeper into the correctness of the logic:

- **Product Calculation (`prod`):** This is the product of all multipliers. If any `k_i` is greater than 1, `prod` will be greater than 1.
- **`vprod` Calculation:** Each element in `vprod` is the product of all multipliers except the current one. This means that `vprod[i] = prod // k_i`.
- **Feasibility Check (`den`):** The feasibility check `den = prod - sum(vprod)` is crucial. For the distribution to be valid, `prod` must be greater than the sum of `vprod`. This is because `prod` is the amount received back for any winning outcome, and `sum(vprod)` is the total amount bet.

### Example Validation
Let's validate the program with the provided example:

**Example Input:**
```
6
3
3 2 7
2
3 3
5
5 5 5 5 5
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
3
6 3 2
5
9 4 6 8 3
```

**Program Output:**
```
27 41 12 
1 1 
-1
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
-1
8 18 12 9 24
```

**Validation:**
- **First Test Case:**
  - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
  - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
  - `den = 42 - 41 = 1 > 0` (Valid)
  - `3 * 14 = 42`, `2 * 21 = 42`, `7 * 6 = 42` (All greater than 41)

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `prod = 3 * 3 = 9`
  - `vprod = [9 // 3, 9 // 3] = [3, 3]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 3 + 3 = 6`
  - `den = 9 - 6 = 3 > 0` (Valid)
  - `3 * 3 = 9`, `3 * 3 = 9` (All greater than 6)

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `prod = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125`
  - `vprod = [3125 // 5] * 5 = [625, 625, 625, 625, 625]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 625 * 5 = 3125`
  - `den = 3125 - 3125 = 0` (Invalid)

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - `prod = 7 * 9 * 3 * 17 * 9 * 13 = 3897237`
  - `vprod = [3897237 // 7, 3897237 // 9, 3897237 // 3, 3897237 // 17, 3897237 // 9, 3897237 // 13]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 556748 + 432915 + 1299079 + 229249 + 432915 + 299787 = 3241403`
  - `den = 3897237 - 3241403 = 655834 > 0` (Valid)
  - Each `k_i * vprod[i]` is greater than `3241403`

- **Fifth Test Case:**
  - `prod = 6 * 3 * 2 = 36`
  - `vprod = [36 // 6, 36 // 3, 36 // 2] = [6, 12, 18]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 6 + 12 + 18 = 36`
  - `den = 36 - 36 = 0` (Invalid)

- **Sixth Test Case:**
  - `prod = 9 * 4 * 6 * 8 * 3 = 4320`
  - `vprod = [4320 // 9, 4320 // 4, 4320 // 6, 4320 // 8, 4320 // 3] = [480, 1080, 720, 540, 1440]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 480 + 1080 + 720 + 540 + 1440 = 4260`
  - `den = 4320 - 4260 = 60 > 0` (Valid)
  - Each `k_i * vprod[i]` is greater than `4260`

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the distribution of coins and handles the edge cases as described in the problem statement. The feasibility check `den = prod - sum(vprod)` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the distribution of coins and checks the feasibility of the distribution based on the given multipliers.
Final: **True**
