The only variable in the loop head is `char`, and it iterates over each character in the `password` string. To ensure that the loop can execute, the `password` string must have at least one character. The states of `digits` and `letters` are not in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters and \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), the condition for the loop to execute is simply that `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `password` has at least one character. Since `password` is already defined as a string of `n` characters, we just need to ensure `n` is at least 1.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
