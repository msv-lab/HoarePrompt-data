Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if we can redistribute water in the containers such that each container has the same amount of water. The key observation is that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, meaning there exists a target amount of water `mean` such that each container should hold `mean` units of water.

The program uses a greedy approach to check if it's possible to achieve this target amount by ensuring that at no point during the traversal from the first container to the last do we have a deficit that cannot be resolved by the water available in the previous containers.

### Program Analysis
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and their respective water amounts `nums`.
2. **Function `func_1(nums)`**:
   - **Calculate Total and Mean**: It calculates the total amount of water and the mean amount of water per container.
   - **Initialize Cumulative Difference (`curr`)**: It initializes `curr` to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean.
   - **Iterate and Update `curr`**: It iterates through each container, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - **Check for Deficit**: If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to balance out the deficit in the current container, so it returns 'NO'.
   - **Return Result**: If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

### Function Summary Validation
The function summary correctly describes the logic of `func_1`. The function checks whether it's possible to redistribute water such that all containers have the same amount by ensuring that the cumulative difference never goes negative.

### Correctness Evaluation
The original assessment is correct. The logic used in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. Here's why:

- **Cumulative Difference Check**: The cumulative difference `curr` ensures that at any point, the water in the containers to the left can be redistributed to meet the mean requirement for the containers seen so far.
- **No Negative Deficit**: If `curr` never becomes negative, it means we can redistribute water to balance out any deficits encountered during the traversal.
- **Redundant Check**: The check `if total % n != 0` is redundant since the problem guarantees that the sum of water is divisible by `n`.

### Final Evaluation
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be redistributed equally among the containers. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
