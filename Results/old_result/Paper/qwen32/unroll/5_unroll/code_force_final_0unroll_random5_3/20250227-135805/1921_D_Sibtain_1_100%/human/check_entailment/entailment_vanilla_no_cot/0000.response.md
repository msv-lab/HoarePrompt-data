Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the total difference D. The approach used in the program does not ensure that the maximum possible difference is achieved for all input cases.

Here are the issues with the program:
1. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` has all identical elements and the array `c` has all identical elements but different from `a`. The check `if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):` is correct, but it does not cover all edge cases where maximizing the difference is trivially zero.
2. The sorting and comparison logic is flawed. The program sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order, but then it incorrectly tries to pair elements from the start and end of both arrays in a way that does not guarantee the maximum difference. Specifically, the loop logic `(i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)` and the subsequent comparisons do not maximize the difference correctly.
3. The program does not consider the possibility of pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `c` and vice versa to maximize the difference, which is the correct strategy.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Sort array `a` in ascending order.
- Sort array `c` in ascending order.
- Pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `c` and the largest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `c` to maximize the absolute differences.
- Sum up these maximum differences to get the result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        c.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            ans += max(abs(a[i] - c[m - n + i]), abs(a[i] - c[i]))
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum possible difference is calculated by optimally pairing elements from `a` and `c`.
