Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description at all. The problem description asks for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that scans subfolders in the current directory, checks if their names fall within a specified range, and then generates corresponding `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files for each `.html` file found in those subfolders. 

However, the given program defines a completely different function `func_1()` that reads input, counts occurrences of '1' in a string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. This program has no relation to the problem description provided. Therefore, it is incorrect.
