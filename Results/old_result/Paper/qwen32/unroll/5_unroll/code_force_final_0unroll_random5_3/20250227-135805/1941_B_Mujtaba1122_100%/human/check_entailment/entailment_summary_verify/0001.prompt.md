You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` as input, where `n` is the length of the list and is between 3 and 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list by potentially reducing the values of elements from index 1 to `n-2` based on the values of their neighboring elements. After modifying the list, it checks a condition using another function `func_1`. If the condition is met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The final state of the program involves the list being potentially modified and a printed message indicating whether the condition was met.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if we can make all elements of an array equal to zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and then:
1. Decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1.
2. Decrease \( a_i \) by 2.
3. Decrease \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.

### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1`
This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It iterates through the array and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
This function attempts to apply the described operation to make all elements zero. It iterates through the array from the second element to the second-to-last element (i.e., indices 1 to \( n-2 \)).

For each element at index \( i \):
- It repeatedly applies the operation as long as \( a_i > 1 \) and both \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0.
- The operation is applied by reducing \( a_{i+1} \) by \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \) by \( 2 \times a_{i-1} \), and \( a_{i-1} \) by \( a_{i-1} \).

However, there are several issues with this approach:
1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The operation should decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1, \( a_i \) by 2, and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, not by the value of \( a_{i-1} \).
2. **Early Termination**: The function prints "no" and returns as soon as it encounters a non-zero element after the first index, which is incorrect. It should continue processing the rest of the array.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The function does not ensure that the operation can be applied in a way that eventually makes all elements zero. It only checks if the operation can be applied repeatedly until \( a_i \le 1 \), which is not sufficient.
4. **Output Handling**: The function prints "YES" or "NO" directly, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the operation and does not ensure that all elements can be made zero. It also handles output in a way that is not suitable for multiple test cases.
