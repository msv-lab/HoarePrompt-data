Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code snippets `func_1` and `func_2` do not fully implement the problem description. Let's break down the missing functionalities and issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for moving an object (player or ball) in the grid based on the direction provided (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - It correctly updates the coordinates of the object based on the direction.
   - However, it does not check for boundaries or other entities (like Bludgers or goals) that could affect the movement or result in a goal or elimination.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and eliminates them.
   - It updates the player's coordinates to `[-1, -1]` to indicate elimination.
   - It prints the elimination event in the required format.
   - However, it does not handle the cases where a player scores a goal, throws the Quaffle, or catches a ball. It also does not update the score or handle the Quaffle's movement or placement after a goal.

3. **Missing Functionalities**:
   - **Goal Scoring**: The code does not check if a player has thrown the Quaffle into a goal and update the score accordingly.
   - **Quaffle Handling**: The code does not handle catching, carrying, or throwing the Quaffle.
   - **Boundary Checks**: The code does not check if a player or ball is moving out of the grid boundaries.
   - **Final Score Output**: The code does not print the final score at the end of the game.
   - **Sorting of Elimination Events**: The code sorts the eliminated players but does not handle the case where multiple players are eliminated in the same step.

Given these issues, the provided code does not fully implement the problem description and cannot handle all the cases as required. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
