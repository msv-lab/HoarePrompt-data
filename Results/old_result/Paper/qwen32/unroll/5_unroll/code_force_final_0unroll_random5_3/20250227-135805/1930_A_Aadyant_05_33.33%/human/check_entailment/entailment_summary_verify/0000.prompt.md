You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then computes the sum of every other element from the sorted list of integers (starting from the first element) and prints this sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

The provided program follows the problem description correctly and handles all potential cases as expected. Here’s a breakdown of the code and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `a` (which is `2n` as per the problem) and the list of integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we pick pairs, we are always picking the smallest available pairs first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

3. **Pair Selection**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and picks every second element starting from the first element. This effectively picks the smallest elements in each pair, which aligns with the strategy to maximize the score.
   - For example, if the sorted list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the program will pick `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(5, 6)`, adding `1 + 3 + 5 = 9` to the score. However, since the problem requires picking the minimum of each pair, the correct pairs to pick for maximum score would be `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(5, 6)` which results in `1 + 3 + 5 = 9` but the correct minimums to add are `1 + 3 + 5 = 9` which is the sum of the first `n` elements in the sorted list.

4. **Output**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the selected elements (which are the minimums of each pair) and appends the result to the output list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The program correctly implements the strategy of always picking the smallest available pairs to maximize the score, and it handles multiple test cases as required by the problem description. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is correct.
