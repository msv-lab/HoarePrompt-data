Precondition: **No specific variables are present in the function signature for `func_5`. This function is not directly related to the core logic of the problem but seems to be a utility function to read input.** 

However, if we consider the context of the problem and the typical usage of such a function, we can infer that it might be used to read a line of input, which could be split into components. Therefore, an appropriate precondition for a function that reads and splits input could be:

Precondition: **The input is a line of space-separated values.**
