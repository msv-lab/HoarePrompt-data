#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters "U" and "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `s` for each test case remain unchanged; `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` is odd or even.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: results is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` is odd or even. The variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `s` for each test case also remain unchanged. The loop has printed each element of the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the count of "U" in the string `s` is odd. If it is, the function outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".
