The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The precondition describes several variables and their relationships, but these do not affect the output of the `print(-1)` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, `vals`, `prod`, `vprod`, and `den`.

Here is the breakdown:
- `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, `vals`, `prod`, `vprod`, and `den` are all defined with specific relationships and values, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print(-1)` statement directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Thus, the output of the code snippet is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
