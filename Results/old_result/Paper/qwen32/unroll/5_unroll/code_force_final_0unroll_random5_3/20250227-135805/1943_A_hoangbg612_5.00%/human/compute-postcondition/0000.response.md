Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4; `T` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
