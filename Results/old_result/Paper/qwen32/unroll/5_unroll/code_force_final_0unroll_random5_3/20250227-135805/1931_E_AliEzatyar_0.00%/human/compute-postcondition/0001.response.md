To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i`, `len(num)`, and the range parameters.

The `for` loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range function produces at least one value. The range function `range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1)` will produce values starting from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which means `len(num)` must be greater than `0`.

Here are the adjustments needed:
- `num` must be a list with at least one element.
- `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1` at the start of the loop.

Since `counter` is not part of the loop head and does not affect whether the loop will execute, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one test case, `counter` is 0**
