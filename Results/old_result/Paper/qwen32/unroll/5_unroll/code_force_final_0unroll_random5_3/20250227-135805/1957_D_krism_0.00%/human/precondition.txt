The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
