### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the given program using the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an integer array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation to split any element `a_i` (if `a_i >= 10`) into its digits and insert those digits in the same position in the array.
- The goal is to determine if we can make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using this operation any number of times.

#### Program Code Analysis:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
```

#### Annotations Recap:
- The annotations describe the program's state at key points.
- The function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The current logic only splits an element if the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than or equal to 10. This is incorrect. The transformation should be applied to any element that is at least 10, and it should be done iteratively.
   
2. **Iterative Transformation**:
   - The program only attempts to transform the array once and checks if it is sorted. It should repeatedly apply the transformation until no more transformations can be made or the array becomes sorted.
   
3. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is correctly defined to check if the array is sorted, but the logic for transformation is flawed.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where the transformation does not help in sorting the array.

#### Corrected Version:
The original assessment suggests a corrected version that repeatedly applies the transformation until no more transformations can be made and then checks if the array is sorted. This is the correct approach.

#### Evaluation:
The original program does not correctly implement the transformation logic and does not handle the problem requirements fully. The suggested corrected version addresses these issues and correctly determines if the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
