### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Logic to Check if the Array Can Be Sorted:**
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted.
   - It then iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (i.e., from the last element to the second element).
   - If it finds an element `arr[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i]`, it attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting list (digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`) is sorted.
   - If the resulting list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such pair, `ans` remains `True`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" if `ans` is `True` and "NO" if `ans` is `False`.

### Issues with the Logic:

- The logic has a critical flaw in how it handles the splitting and checking of the array:
  - The program only checks if splitting `arr[i-1]` and appending `arr[i]` results in a sorted list. However, this does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation.
  - For example, consider the array `[28, 5]`. The program will check if splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and appending `5` results in a sorted list (`[2, 8, 5]`), which it does not. So, it will incorrectly conclude that the array cannot be sorted.
  - However, the correct approach would involve checking if the entire array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation, not just checking a single pair at a time.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
