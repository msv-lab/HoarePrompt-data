You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be reduced to all zeros by applying specific operations: subtracting twice the current element from the next element and the current element from the element after next, while ensuring no element becomes negative. It outputs 'YES' if the list can be reduced to all zeros, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n - 1\)) and then:
- Decrease \(a_{i-1}\) by 1.
- Decrease \(a_i\) by 2.
- Decrease \(a_{i+1}\) by 1.

The key aspect is to see if we can reduce the array to all zeros using this operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case, reads the array, and then attempts to reduce the array to zeros by iterating through the array and applying the operation. However, the implementation is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The program incorrectly applies the operation by setting `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`. This logic does not match the problem's operation, which requires decreasing `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1. Instead, the program is essentially trying to force `b[i]` to zero by subtracting it from `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` and then setting `b[i]` to zero.

2. **Negative Values Check**: The program checks for negative values in the array, but it does so incorrectly. If `b[i]` is negative, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop. However, negative values can occur due to the incorrect logic of the operation, not necessarily because it's impossible to make the array zero.

3. **Final Check**: After processing the array, the program checks if the last two elements (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are zero. If not, it prints "NO". This is also incorrect because the logic to reduce the array is flawed, and it may incorrectly conclude that it's impossible even when it's possible.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
