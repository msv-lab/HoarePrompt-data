To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a).
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each test case, the code reads `n` and `num_list`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each number in `num_list` using a dictionary `num_of_lens`.
   - It calculates the number of combinations of three numbers (`cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`) and adds it to `res` if the count of any number is 3 or more.
   - It also calculates the number of combinations of two numbers from the current number and all previously processed numbers (`cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`) and adds it to `res` if the count of any number is 2 or more.
   - `total_count` keeps a running total of all counts processed so far.
   - After processing each test case, the result `res` is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output State**:
   - After all test cases are processed, `results` will contain the results for each test case in the order they were processed.
   - `test_cases` remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of iterations.

Given the above explanation, the output state will be:

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the calculated results for each test case, and `test_cases` remains unchanged.**
