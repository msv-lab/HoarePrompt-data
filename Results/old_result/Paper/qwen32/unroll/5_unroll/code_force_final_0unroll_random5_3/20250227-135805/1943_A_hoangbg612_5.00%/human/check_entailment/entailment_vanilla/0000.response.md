Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step:

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and deleting them.
   - Alice adds her chosen element to array `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - The optimal strategy involves both players playing optimally to achieve their respective goals.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted to facilitate the MEX calculation.

3. **Tracking MEX:**
   - `cur` is initialized to -1 and will track the current MEX.
   - `M` is a dictionary that counts occurrences of each number in the array.

4. **MEX Calculation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array:
     - If the current number is greater than `cur`:
       - If the current number is greater than `cur + 1`, it means `cur + 1` is the MEX, so it breaks the loop.
       - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to the current number and increments its count in `M`.
     - If the current number is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `n`, it means all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present, so `cur` is incremented.
   - Finally, it checks if any number `i` in the range `[0, cur)` has a count less than or equal to `i`, and if so, it updates `cur` to `i`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the MEX is greater than the highest number in the array.
   - The program does not correctly account for the optimal moves by Alice and Bob.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly in terms of input/output structure, but the core logic for determining the MEX is incorrect.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the MEX under optimal play by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
