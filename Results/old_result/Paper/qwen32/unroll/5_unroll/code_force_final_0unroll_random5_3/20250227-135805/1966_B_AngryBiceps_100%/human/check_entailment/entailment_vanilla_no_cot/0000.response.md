To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using the given operation. The operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Color Row or Column:** If there is a row or column where all squares are the same color, it can potentially help in making the entire grid the same color.
2. **Contradictory Rows/Columns:** If there is a row or column where all squares are the same color but this color differs from another row or column where all squares are the same color, it might be impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

### Program Analysis:
The program checks two specific conditions:
1. If the first and last rows are completely the same color but different from each other.
2. If the first and last columns are completely the same color but different from each other.

If either of these conditions is true, the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

### Correctness Check:
The conditions checked by the program are not sufficient to determine the possibility of making the entire grid the same color. Here are some edge cases and scenarios where the program might fail:

1. **Grid with Multiple Rows and Columns of Same Color:**
   - Consider a grid where the first row and last row are the same color, but there are other rows that are different. The program might incorrectly output "YES" when it should be "NO".

2. **Grid with Mixed Patterns:**
   - Consider a grid where no single row or column is completely the same color, but it's still possible to make the entire grid the same color through multiple operations. The program might incorrectly output "NO" when it should be "YES".

### Example:
Consider the following grid:
```
WBB
BBW
BWB
```
- The first and last rows are not the same color, and neither are the first and last columns. However, it's possible to make the entire grid the same color through multiple operations. The program will output "YES" which is correct.

However, consider this grid:
```
WBB
BBW
BBW
```
- The first and last rows are not the same color, and neither are the first and last columns. But it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. The program will output "YES" which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all possible scenarios and edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
