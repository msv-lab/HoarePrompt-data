### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the program and its annotations to ensure it meets all the specified conditions for a strong password.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly identifies the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the password string.

2. **Password Validation (function `func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each password.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates over the password:
     - If a character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If a character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - It then iterates over the password again to ensure no digit comes after a letter:
     - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found (`last_digit_index`).
     - If it encounters a letter after a digit, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If all checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

### Annotations and States:
- The annotations confirm the state of the program at various points, ensuring that:
  - `digits` and `letters` lists are correctly populated.
  - `last_digit_index` correctly tracks the last digit's position.
  - The sorted checks for `digits` and `letters` are correctly performed.

### Testing the Program:
- **Test Case 1: `12ac`**
  - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - No digit after a letter.
  - Result: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2: `123wa`**
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['w', 'a']` (not sorted)
  - Result: `NO` (Correct, due to unsorted letters)

- **Test Case 3: `allllmost`**
  - Digits: `[]` (sorted, trivially)
  - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - No digit after a letter.
  - Result: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4: `ac123`**
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digit after a letter.
  - Result: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5: `011679`**
  - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `[]` (sorted, trivially)
  - No digit after a letter.
  - Result: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for checking whether a password is strong according to the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and examples correctly. The annotations and states provided in the annotated version of the code confirm that the program behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
