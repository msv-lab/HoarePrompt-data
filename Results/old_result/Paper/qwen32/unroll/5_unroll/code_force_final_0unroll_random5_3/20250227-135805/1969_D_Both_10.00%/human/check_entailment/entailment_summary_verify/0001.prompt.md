You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function takes two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers. It calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and adds to this the sum of the elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is non-negative. The function returns this calculated sum.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who are interacting over a set of items with different prices for each of them. Alice aims to maximize her profit, while Bob tries to minimize it. The profit is calculated based on the prices Alice and Bob pay for the items they buy or take for free.

The key points to consider:
1. Alice can choose any subset of items to buy.
2. If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob can take all of them for free.
3. If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob can take `k` items for free and will buy the rest from Alice at Bob's prices.
4. Alice's profit is the difference between the sum of the prices Bob pays her and the sum of the prices Alice pays for the items.

### Code Analysis
Let's break down the code provided:

1. **Input Handling Functions:**
   - `func_1()` is supposed to read an integer from the input.
   - `func_2()` is supposed to read a line of integers from the input and return them as a map object.

2. **Profit Calculation Function:**
   - `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)` is supposed to calculate Alice's profit. However, the implementation does not seem correct based on the problem statement.

The current implementation of `func_3`:
- `sub_summ` is initialized to 0.
- It sums up all the values from `sec_arr`, which is not explained in the problem context.
- It then iterates over `main_ar` and adds the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` to `sub_summ` if their sum is non-negative.

### Issues in the Code
- The code does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
- The function `func_3` does not correctly calculate Alice's profit based on the problem's rules.
- There is no logic to handle the case where Alice buys fewer than `k` items or `k` or more items.
- The function `func_3` does not differentiate between the items Alice buys and the items Bob buys or takes for free.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Calculate the profit for each item as `b_i - a_i`.
2. Sort the items based on this profit in descending order.
3. If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob takes all for free, and Alice's profit is 0.
4. If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob takes `k` items with the highest profit for free, and Alice's profit is the sum of the profits of the remaining items.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the provided code, it is clear that the code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
