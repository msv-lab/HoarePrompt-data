### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations provided.

#### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. To maximize this beauty, arranging the array in either ascending or descending order would indeed maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is because sorting ensures the largest possible differences between adjacent elements.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - **Sorting**: The function sorts the array. This is a correct approach since sorting the array will maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Beauty Calculation**: The function initializes `beauty` to 0 and then iterates through the sorted array, adding the absolute difference between each consecutive pair of elements to `beauty`. Since the array is sorted, `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` is simply `array[i] - array[i - 1]` (because `array[i] >= array[i - 1]` after sorting).
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the computed `beauty`, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This is the correct approach to compute the maximum beauty.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads input from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and the elements of each array. It correctly processes each test case by reading the length of the array and the array elements.
   - **Beauty Calculation**: For each test case, it calls `func_1(array)` to compute the maximum beauty of the array. This is correct as `func_1` correctly computes the maximum beauty.
   - **Output**: It stores the result for each test case in a list and prints the results after processing all test cases. This is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
  - Before `func_1` is called, `array` is a list of integers with length `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and each element in the array is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
  - After sorting in `func_1`, `array` is a sorted list of integers, and `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
  - In `func_2`, the state of variables like `index`, `results`, `array`, `t`, and `data` is correctly described.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and computing the sum of consecutive differences. It handles multiple test cases and processes the input/output as specified in the problem description. The annotations provide a clear and accurate description of the program's behavior at key points.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
