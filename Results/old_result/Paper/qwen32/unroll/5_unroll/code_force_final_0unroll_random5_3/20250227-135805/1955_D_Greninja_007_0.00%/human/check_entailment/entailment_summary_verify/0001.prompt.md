You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

            matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])
        window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1

        good_subarrays += 1
    return good_subarrays



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in list `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element in the subarray and in list `b` is at least `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
1. We need to find subarrays of length `m` in array `a`.
2. A subarray is considered "good" if it can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.
3. We need to count how many such "good" subarrays exist in `a`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, array `a`, and array `b`.
2. **Counting Frequencies:** The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the first subarray of length `m` in `a`.
3. **Initial Matching Calculation:** It calculates the initial number of matches between the first subarray and `b` using the minimum of the counts of each element.
4. **Sliding Window:** The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a`. For each new element added to the window, it updates the match count and checks if the current window is "good".
5. **Final Check:** It performs a final check after the loop to account for the last subarray.

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Initial Setup:** The initial setup correctly counts the frequencies and matches for the first subarray.
2. **Sliding Window Mechanism:** The sliding window mechanism correctly updates the match count as it slides through the array. It ensures that the match count is updated by considering the element that is removed from the window and the element that is added to the window.
3. **Final Check:** The final check ensures that the last subarray is considered.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Elements Match:** If all elements in `b` match the first `m` elements of `a`, the program should correctly identify it.
- **No Elements Match:** If no elements in `b` match any elements in `a`, the program should correctly identify that there are no good subarrays.
- **Multiple Matches:** If there are multiple subarrays that can be rearranged to match `b`, the program should correctly count all of them.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of "good" subarrays in `a` for each test case. It efficiently handles the sliding window updates and correctly counts the matches.
