### Reasoning:
The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly 1 cube in each move. To determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between `n` and `m`.

Here's the analysis:
- If `n` is the total number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes, we need to consider that each move can either increase or decrease the number of cubes by 1.
- To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of such changes is required to go from 0 cubes to `m` cubes or from some other number of cubes to `m` cubes.
- Additionally, `n` must be at least `m` because if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves (since each move can only add or remove 1 cube).

The provided code correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It then checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
The code correctly implements the logic described above and adheres to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
