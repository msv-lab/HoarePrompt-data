The only variable in the loop head is `val_b`, which is an element of `main_ar`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `main_ar` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The variable `sec_arr` and `sub_summ` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`**
