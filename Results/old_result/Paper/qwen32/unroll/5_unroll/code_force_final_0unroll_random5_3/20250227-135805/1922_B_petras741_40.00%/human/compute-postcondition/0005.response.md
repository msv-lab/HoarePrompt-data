Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of sticks and their corresponding exponents. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to select three sticks that can form a triangle based on their lengths, which are determined by the exponents provided. If there are fewer than three sticks, it outputs 0 for that test case.**
