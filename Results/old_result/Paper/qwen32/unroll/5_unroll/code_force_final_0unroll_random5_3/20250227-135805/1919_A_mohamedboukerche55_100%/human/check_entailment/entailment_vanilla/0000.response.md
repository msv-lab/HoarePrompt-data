To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the game rules and the provided solution.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**: Alice starts with `a` coins and Bob with `b` coins.
2. **Turns**: Players alternate turns.
3. **Moves**:
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - They must then remove one coin from their current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Insight:
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation:
- When `(a + b)` is even, Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves until the last coin. Since Alice starts, Bob will take the last coin and Alice will be unable to make a move, thus Bob wins.
- When `(a + b)` is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, ensuring she wins.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, and checks if `(a + b)` is even or odd. If even, it prints "Bob", otherwise it prints "Alice".

This logic aligns perfectly with the key insight derived above.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner by checking the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets and applying the optimal strategy derived from the game rules.
Correctness: **True**
