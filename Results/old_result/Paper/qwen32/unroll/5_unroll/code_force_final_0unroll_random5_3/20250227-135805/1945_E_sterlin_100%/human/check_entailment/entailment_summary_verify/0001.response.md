### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not contain any logic to perform the necessary swaps or to implement the binary search algorithm. The functions `func_1` through `func_5` are utility functions for reading input, but they do not address the core problem of rearranging the permutation and performing the binary search.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Missing Core Logic:**
   - The code does not include any logic to determine which swaps (if any) are necessary to make the binary search successful.
   - There is no implementation of the binary search algorithm that will find the number `x` after the swaps.

2. **Incomplete Implementation:**
   - The functions provided (`func_1` to `func_5`) are solely for reading input and do not contribute to solving the problem.
   - The problem requires specific actions (swaps) and a subsequent binary search, which are entirely absent from the provided code.

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary for `func_5` is incorrect. It states that `func_5` returns a list of strings, but the actual implementation of `func_5` in the given code does not exist. The code only defines `func_5` to return the result of `input().split()`, which indeed returns a list of strings. However, this function is not used anywhere in the provided code.

### Conclusion:

Given that the provided code is incomplete and does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
