The code assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `j`. The length of `arr` is `n`, so `j` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr), `n` is the length of `arr`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`.**
