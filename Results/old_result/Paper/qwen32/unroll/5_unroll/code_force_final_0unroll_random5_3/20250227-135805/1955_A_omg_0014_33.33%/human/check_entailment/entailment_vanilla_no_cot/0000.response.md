Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that affect its correctness:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program reads `n` (the number of test cases) and then expects each subsequent line to contain three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the problem description specifies that the input for each test case contains `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The variable `c` in the code should be `b` according to the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is not necessary and incorrect. Instead, it should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`) with the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

3. **Incorrect Comparison and Output**: The program compares `a * b` (which is incorrect as explained above) with `a * d` (which is also incorrect). It should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying as many pairs at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurts
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost by considering how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts need to be bought at the regular price.
