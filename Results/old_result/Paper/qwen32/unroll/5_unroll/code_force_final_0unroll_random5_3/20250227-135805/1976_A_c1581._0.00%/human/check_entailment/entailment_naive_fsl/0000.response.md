Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly. The function `func_1` does not check if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order when they are the only characters in the password. However, the code does check for the conditions involving both letters and digits, and it handles the case where a digit comes after a letter correctly.

Let's consider the following test cases:

1. **Password with only digits**: "12345" should return "YES" because the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Password with only letters**: "abcde" should return "YES" because the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Password with only digits but not sorted**: "54321" should return "NO" because the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Password with only letters but not sorted**: "edcba" should return "NO" because the letters are not sorted in non-decreasing order.

The current implementation does not explicitly check these conditions for passwords consisting only of digits or only of letters. However, it implicitly handles the case where the password consists only of digits or only of letters because the `sorted` function will return the same list if the list is already sorted, and the conditions for digits coming after letters are not violated in these cases.

To ensure correctness, we can add explicit checks for these conditions. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits and digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters and letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))
```

In this corrected version, we added checks to ensure that the digits and letters are sorted only if they are present in the password. This ensures that passwords consisting only of digits or only of letters are handled correctly.
