The provided code snippets seem to be parts of a larger program that simulates the Quidditch match described in the problem statement. However, the provided code is incomplete and lacks the main logic for handling the game's events, such as catching the Quaffle, throwing it, scoring goals, and keeping track of the score. Let's analyze the provided functions and their potential correctness based on the problem description.

### Function 1: `func_1(obj, d)`
This function appears to move an object (`obj`) in one of four directions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`). The object is represented by a list or array with two elements, presumably the row and column indices on the field.

- **Reasoning:**
  - The function correctly updates the row and column indices based on the direction provided.
  - It assumes that `obj` is a mutable list or array, which is necessary for the changes to persist outside the function.

### Function 2: `func_2(t)`
This function appears to handle the elimination of players due to contact with the Bludger. It checks if any player's position matches the Bludger's position and eliminates them.

- **Reasoning:**
  - The function iterates over all players and checks if their position matches the Bludger's position.
  - If a match is found, it adds the player to an `out` list and sets the player's position to `[-1, -1]` (presumably marking them as eliminated).
  - It then prints the elimination event for each player in the `out` list, sorted alphabetically.
  
### Missing Parts:
- **Initialization:** The code does not show how the field, players, Quaffle, and Bludger are initialized.
- **Action Handling:** There is no code to handle player actions such as catching the Quaffle, throwing it, or scoring goals.
- **Goal Checking:** There is no code to check if the Quaffle is in a goal and to update the score accordingly.
- **Score Tracking:** There is no code to keep track of the score for each team.
- **Main Loop:** There is no main loop to process each step of the game.

### Conclusion:
While the provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) seem to correctly handle the movement of an object and the elimination of players due to the Bludger, the overall program is incomplete and lacks the necessary logic to fully simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the provided code cannot be considered correct without the missing parts.

**Correctness: False**
