Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Counting fireworks from each installation**:
   - The program calculates `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`. This counts the number of fireworks launched by the first and second installations within the first `m` minutes and adds 2. The addition of 2 is not justified and does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Overlap not considered**:
   - The original program does not account for the overlap in visibility times between fireworks from the two installations. For example, if a firework from the first installation is launched at time `x` and a firework from the second installation is launched at time `y`, both fireworks could be visible simultaneously if `|x - y| <= m`. The program does not handle this overlap scenario.

3. **Correct approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a period that includes the LCM. We also need to account for the overlap in visibility times. The corrected program should calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the first `m` minutes and subtract the overlap in visibility times.

The corrected version of the program, as suggested in the original assessment, properly handles the overlap and calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Final: **False**
