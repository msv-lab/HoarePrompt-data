The function evaluates multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of lists with distinct integers. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to rearrange the lists such that all lists are identical except for the first element, which is unique to each list. It prints 'yes' if such a rearrangement is possible and 'no' otherwise.
