The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and `q`, an array `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function determines for each query whether a specific condition is met within the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
