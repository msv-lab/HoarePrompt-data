Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `X` (2 <= X <= 10^18). For each test case, it calculates the number of iterations required to reduce `X` to 1 using a specific set of operations and generates a sequence of numbers corresponding to those operations. The function outputs the number of iterations and the sequence for each test case.**
