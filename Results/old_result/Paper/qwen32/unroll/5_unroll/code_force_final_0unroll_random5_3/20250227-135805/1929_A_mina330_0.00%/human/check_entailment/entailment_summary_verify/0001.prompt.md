You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, and prints this sum. After processing each test case, the function does not retain any of the intermediate results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. The beauty of the array is given by:

\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

The expression simplifies to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 + a_{n-1} - a_2 + a_{n-2} - a_3 + \ldots \]

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the largest elements are placed in the odd positions (considering 1-based indexing) and the smallest elements are placed in the even positions. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

However, the provided program does not follow this optimal strategy. Instead, it sorts the array and then sums up the differences between the largest and smallest elements in a specific pattern:

```python
for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
    kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
```

This loop calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements in the first half of the sorted array and the corresponding elements in the second half. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty of the array.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
