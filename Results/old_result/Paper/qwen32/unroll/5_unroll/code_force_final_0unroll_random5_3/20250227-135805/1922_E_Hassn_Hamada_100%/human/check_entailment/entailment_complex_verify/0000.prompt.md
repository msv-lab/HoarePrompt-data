You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns the tuple (0, 0).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences, but the implementation seems to have issues. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Function Signature and Return Values**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list in place and return nothing (`None`), but it has a return statement that returns a tuple `(0, 0)` when `number == 0`. This return value is not used anywhere, and it can be removed.

2. **Logic for Generating the Sequence**:
   - The logic for generating the sequence seems complex and not straightforward. The use of bitwise operations and the recursive calls might not be generating the correct sequence for all values of `X`.
   - The assertion `assert number >= 0` is fine, but it does not handle the case where `number` could be zero, which should be a valid input scenario.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, if `X = 2`, the expected output is an array of length 1, but the program might not generate this correctly.
   - The program might not handle very large values of `X` correctly, as the logic seems to rely on a specific pattern that might not scale well.

4. **Testing Specific Cases**:
   - Let's test the program with `X = 2`. The expected output is `1\n0`, but the program might not generate this correctly.
   - Testing with `X = 5` should produce an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences, but the provided output `3\n0 1 0` does not seem to meet this requirement.

Given these points, the program does not appear to be correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
