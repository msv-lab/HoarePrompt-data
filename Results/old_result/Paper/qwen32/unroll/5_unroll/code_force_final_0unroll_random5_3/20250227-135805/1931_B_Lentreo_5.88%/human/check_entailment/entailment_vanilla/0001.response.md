Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem states that we have `n` containers of water, and the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. The goal is to determine if we can make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.

### Key Points:

1. **Equal Distribution**: Since the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water for each container is `total_water / n`.
2. **Pouring Operation**: Water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

### Strategy:

To achieve the equal distribution, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference between the actual water in the containers and the target water level is zero by the end of the sequence. This is because the pouring operation can only move water from left to right, and the cumulative difference must balance out.

### Provided Program Analysis:

Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly implements the strategy:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program initializes `last` to the last element of the list and then calculates `curr` by summing up `i - last` for each `i` in `nums`. This does not correctly check the cumulative difference needed to balance the water levels.
2. **Misunderstanding the Target**: The program does not calculate the target water level (`total_water / n`) and does not check if the cumulative difference from the target is zero.
3. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `if i != 0` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct logic of the problem.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Calculate Target**: Compute the target water level `target = total_water / n`.
2. **Check Cumulative Difference**: Iterate through the list and maintain a running cumulative difference between the actual water and the target water. If the cumulative difference is zero by the end, it is possible to balance the water levels.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the water levels can be balanced. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
