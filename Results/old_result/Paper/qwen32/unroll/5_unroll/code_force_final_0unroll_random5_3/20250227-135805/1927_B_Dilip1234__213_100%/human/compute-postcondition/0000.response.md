The code snippet `s = ''` initializes the variable `s` to an empty string. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the trace `a` corresponds to a valid string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. `s` is an empty string.**
