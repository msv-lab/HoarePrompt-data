To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, inf):`, which involves the variable `i` and the constant `inf`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop will start with `i` initialized to 1 and will continue as long as `i` is less than `inf` (which is 200001). Therefore, the loop will execute at least once if `i` is initialized to 1.

2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. The constant `inf` is already defined and cannot be changed.

3. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop executes, `i` must be initialized to a value that satisfies the loop condition (`i < inf`). Since `i` starts from 1 in the `range(1, inf)`, no adjustment is needed for `i` itself as it is correctly set to start from 1. However, we should confirm that `inf` is correctly set to 200001 to ensure the loop can run as expected.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `inf`, and `values` are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted in this context. However, they are part of the initial state description.

Given the above points, the state does not need any adjustment for `i` or `inf` to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute as long as `i` starts from 1 and `inf` is 200001.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1**
