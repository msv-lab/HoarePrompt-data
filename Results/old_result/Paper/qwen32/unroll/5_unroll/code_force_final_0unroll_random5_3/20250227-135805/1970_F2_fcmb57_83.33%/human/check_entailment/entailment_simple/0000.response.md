### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It parses the field to identify players, goals, and the Quaffle's initial position. It also sets the initial position of the Bludger if present.
   - It correctly initializes the scores for both teams and the middle position of the field.

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The program handles player movements using the `func_1` function, which correctly updates the player's position based on the direction specified in the input.
   - It checks for collisions with the Bludger. If a player and the Bludger are on the same cell after a move, the player is eliminated. The program prints the elimination event and updates the Quaffle's position if the eliminated player was carrying it.

3. **Catching and Throwing the Quaffle**:
   - The program correctly handles catching the Quaffle by updating the Quaffle's carrier.
   - When a player throws the Quaffle, the program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If it is, the program updates the score for the opposing team and resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field. It also prints the goal event.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding a point to the opposing team.
   - The program handles the case where multiple players are eliminated at the same time, printing the elimination events in alphabetical order.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the main events of the game in the correct order and prints the final score at the end.

### Issues:
- There is a typo in the code: `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` in the catch action handling.
- The program does not handle the case where the Quaffle is caught by a player who is already carrying another ball (though the problem guarantees this will not happen).

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning and the identified issues, the program is mostly correct but contains a critical typo. Therefore, the correctness assessment is:

**Correctness: False**
