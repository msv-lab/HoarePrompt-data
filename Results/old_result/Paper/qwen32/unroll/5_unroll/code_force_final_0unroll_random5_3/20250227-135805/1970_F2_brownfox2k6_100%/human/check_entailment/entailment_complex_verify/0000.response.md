Let's carefully evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the program code, and the annotations.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The code correctly initializes the field and reads the initial positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - It also reads the number of steps and the actions for each step.

2. **Movement Handling (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` correctly updates the coordinates of an entity based on the direction provided (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - The annotations confirm that `func_1` updates the coordinates correctly.

3. **Elimination Handling (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` correctly identifies players that are on the same cell as the Bludger and marks them as eliminated.
   - It prints the elimination events in the required format.
   - The annotations confirm that `func_2` handles eliminations correctly.

4. **Action Handling:**
   - **Catch (`C`)**: The code updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - **Throw (`T`)**: The code updates the `carry` variable to `None` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If it is, it updates the score and resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field.
   - **Movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`)**: The code moves the player, the Quaffle, or the Bludger based on the action. It then checks for eliminations by calling `func_2`.

5. **Boundary Checks:**
   - The code does not explicitly check for boundary conditions, but since the problem guarantees valid actions, this is not an issue.

6. **Final Score Output:**
   - The code prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description

- **Goal Scoring:** The code correctly checks if the Quaffle is in a goal after it is thrown and updates the score accordingly.
- **Quaffle Handling:** The code correctly handles catching, carrying, and throwing the Quaffle.
- **Elimination Events:** The code correctly identifies and prints elimination events.
- **Final Score Output:** The code correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.
- **Sorting of Elimination Events:** The code sorts the eliminated players alphabetically, as required.

### Conclusion

The code implements all the required functionalities as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles movements, scoring, eliminations, and outputs the final score. The annotations confirm that the code behaves as expected at key points.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
