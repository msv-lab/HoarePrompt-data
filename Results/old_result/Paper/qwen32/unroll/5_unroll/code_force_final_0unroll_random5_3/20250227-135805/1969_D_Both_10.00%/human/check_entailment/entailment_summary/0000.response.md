Let's analyze the given Python program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice and Bob are buying items from a shop.
- Alice wants to maximize her profit, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- Alice's profit is calculated as the difference between what Bob pays her for the items he buys and what Alice spends on the items she buys.
- Bob can take up to `k` items for free if Alice buys at least `k` items.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each with:
- `n`: number of items
- `k`: maximum number of items Bob can take for free
- `a`: list of prices Alice pays
- `b`: list of prices Bob pays

The goal is to determine Alice's maximum profit.

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Reads an integer from standard input (the number of test cases `t`).
   - Output: Correctly reads and returns the integer from the input.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Reads a line from standard input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object.
   - Output: Correctly reads and returns a list of integers from the input.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, then reads the lists `a` and `b`.
   - `a` is negated to facilitate the use of a min-heap as a max-heap.
   - The items are paired and sorted by Bob's price (`b`), in ascending order.
   - The first `k` items are pushed into a heap (`k_arr`), and the remaining items are stored in `arr`.
   - The program calculates the initial `sub_sum` by adding the negated prices from `k_arr` and the non-negative sums of `a + b` from `arr`.
   - It then iteratively updates `sub_sum` by removing the least profitable item from `k_arr` and adding the next item from `arr` if it's more profitable.
   - The maximum profit (`max_value`) is updated whenever a higher profit is found.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
   - Computes the sum of the first elements (negated Alice's prices) of `sec_arr` and adds the sum of `a + b` for each tuple in `main_ar` where `a + b` is non-negative.
   - Output: Correctly calculates the sum as described.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit Alice can achieve by considering all possible subsets of items she can buy and the optimal choices Bob can make. The use of a heap ensures efficient selection of the least profitable items to be removed from the subset of items Alice buys.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided logic and function descriptions.

**Correctness: True**
