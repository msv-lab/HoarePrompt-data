Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an integer array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation to split any element greater than or equal to 10 into its digits, inserting the digits in the same position.
- The goal is to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using this operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program processes each test case in the `func_1` function.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and checks if an element is greater than 10.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it attempts to split it into its digits.
   - The digits are then inserted into a new list `c` based on some conditions.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the new list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.
   
4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints "YES" if the corresponding value in `b` is `1` and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The logic for splitting elements and inserting digits into `c` is flawed.
  - The program does not always correctly handle the insertion of digits and the conditions for sorting.
  
- **Handling of Initial Elements:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the first element of the array when it is greater than 10.
  
- **Sorting Check:**
  - The program checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing, but it does not account for the possibility of further splits that could lead to a sorted array.
  
### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if it is possible to sort the array using the described operation. It fails to handle some edge cases and does not ensure that the array can be sorted through multiple splits.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
