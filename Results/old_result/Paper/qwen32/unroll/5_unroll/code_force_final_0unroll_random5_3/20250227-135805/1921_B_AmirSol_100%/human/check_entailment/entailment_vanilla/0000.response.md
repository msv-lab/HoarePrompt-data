Reasoning:
To determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (s1) into the desired state (s2), we need to consider the number of cats that need to be added and the number of cats that need to be removed.

1. **Counting Cats to Add**: We iterate through the boxes and count how many boxes in the desired state (s2) are empty ('0' in s1 but '1' in s2). This gives us the number of cats that need to be added.

2. **Counting Cats to Remove**: Similarly, we count how many boxes in the initial state (s1) have a cat ('1' in s1 but '0' in s2). This gives us the number of cats that need to be removed.

3. **Calculating Minimum Operations**: The critical insight is that the number of operations needed is the maximum of the two counts above. This is because we can move any cat that needs to be removed to a box that needs a cat in one operation, but if there are more cats to add than to remove (or vice versa), the extra operations will be determined by the larger count.

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by calculating `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` and then returning the maximum of the two.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
