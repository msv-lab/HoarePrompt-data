In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `inf` and `values` are used outside the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that the loop will execute `t` times, the only state we need to ensure is that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The values of `inf` and `values` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted in the context of making sure the loop runs.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where `values[0]` is 0 and `values[i]` for i from 1 to 200000 is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to i**
