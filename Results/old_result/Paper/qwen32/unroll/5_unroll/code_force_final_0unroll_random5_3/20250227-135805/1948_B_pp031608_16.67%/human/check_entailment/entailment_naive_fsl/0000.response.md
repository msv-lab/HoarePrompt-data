Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation and sorting logic as described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Transformation Logic**:
   - The code attempts to split an element if it is greater than 10 and if the previous element is greater than the current element. However, this logic is flawed. The transformation should be applied to any element that is at least 10, and the transformation should be done iteratively until no more transformations can be made that would help in sorting the array.
   - The transformation logic should be applied to any element that is at least 10, not just when the previous element is greater than the current element.

2. **Lack of Iterative Transformation**:
   - The code only attempts to transform the array once and checks if it is sorted. However, the problem allows for multiple transformations to be applied until the array is sorted or it is determined that it cannot be sorted.
   - The code should repeatedly apply the transformation until no more transformations can be made or the array becomes sorted.

3. **Incorrect Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called without being defined in the provided code snippet. It seems like it should be a function to check if the array is sorted, but it is used incorrectly in the context of the transformation logic.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where the transformation does not help in sorting the array.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        transformed = False
        i = 0
        while i < len(arr):
            if arr[i] >= 10:
                # Split the number into its digits
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                arr = arr[:i] + digits + arr[i+1:]
                transformed = True
            else:
                i += 1
        if not transformed:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version repeatedly applies the transformation until no more transformations can be made and then checks if the array is sorted.
