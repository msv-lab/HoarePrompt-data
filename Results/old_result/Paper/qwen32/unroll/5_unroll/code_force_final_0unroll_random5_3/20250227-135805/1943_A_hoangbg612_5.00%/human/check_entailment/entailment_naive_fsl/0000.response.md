Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly implements the strategy for the game between Alice and Bob to determine the final score based on the MEX of the array `c`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:** The code correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `N` itself.
2. **Sorting:** The array `N` is sorted, which is a step that might be used to facilitate the process of finding the MEX.
3. **Tracking MEX:** The code uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of each number in the array `N`.
4. **Determine MEX:** The code iterates through the sorted array to determine the MEX of the array `c` as elements are optimally chosen by Alice and Bob.

#### Issues:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Fully Implemented:**
   - The current strategy does not fully account for the optimal moves of both Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The provided code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob explicitly, which could lead to incorrect results.
   - The code simply calculates the MEX based on the sorted array and counts, which does not consider the strategic choices made during the game.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider an array where all elements are the same, e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. In this case, Alice will pick `1` and append it to `c`, and Bob will also pick `1` and remove it from `a`. This process will continue until `a` is empty, and `c` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. The MEX of this array is `0`, but the code might not handle this correctly.
   - Another edge case is when the array contains consecutive numbers, e.g., `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. Here, the MEX should be `4` if both play optimally, but the code might not correctly simulate this scenario.

#### Incorrect Case:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
- **Expected Output:** `1` (since Bob can always pick the smallest number, and Alice will be forced to pick the next smallest, leading to `c = [1, 0, 3, 2]` or a similar permutation, and the MEX is `1`).
- **Actual Output:** The code might output `4` because it does not simulate the turns and just calculates the MEX based on the sorted array.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly simulate the game and might not handle all edge cases as expected. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

If the code were to correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and account for their optimal strategies, it would be considered correct. However, as it stands, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
