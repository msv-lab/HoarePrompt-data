The given initial state describes a list that has undergone certain modifications, specifically that elements from index 1 to n-2 may have been reduced to 0 or other values, while the first and last elements remain unchanged unless they were part of the reduction operations. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('YES')`.

This means that the output of the `print` statement is not dependent on the state of the list or the result of `func_1(list, n)`. The `print` statement will output the string 'YES' as it is written.

Output: **YES**
