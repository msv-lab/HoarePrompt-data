To determine what will be printed by the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of `_min_edge` and `res`.

1. **_min_edge**: This variable holds the smallest edge weight in any connected component of the graph. Since the exact values of the edges in the graph are not provided, we can only describe `_min_edge` as the smallest edge weight found in the connected components.

2. **res**: This variable holds the result of the `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` function call. The `dfs` function likely performs a Depth-First Search starting from `node_u` (which is one of the nodes of the edge with the smallest weight in the connected component). The second argument `-1` usually represents the parent node (indicating no parent in the initial call), and the third argument `[]` is an empty list that gets populated during the DFS traversal with some result (likely the path or some other information from the traversal).

Since the exact graph structure, the edge weights, and the result of the DFS are not provided, we can only describe `_min_edge` and `res` in general terms based on the given information.

Output: **_min_edge (where _min_edge is the smallest edge weight in any connected component), len(res) (where res is the result of the dfs(node_u, -1, []) function call)**
