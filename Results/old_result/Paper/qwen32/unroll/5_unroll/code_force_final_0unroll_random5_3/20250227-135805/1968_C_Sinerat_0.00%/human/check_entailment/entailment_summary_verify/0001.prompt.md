You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it constructs and prints an array `a` of length `n` where the first element is 500 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in the input array `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program in the context of the problem requirements.

The problem requires us to find an array `a` such that:
1. Each element `a_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (inclusive).
2. For each `i` from 2 to `n`, `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

The program provided initializes the first element of `a` to 500 and then iteratively sets each subsequent element to the sum of the previous element and the corresponding `x` value. Let's check if this approach satisfies the problem conditions:

1. **Range of `a_i`**: The first element `a[0]` is set to 500, which is within the allowed range. For the subsequent elements, since `x_i` is at most 500, the maximum possible value of `a_i` is `500 + 500 = 1000`. This is also within the allowed range of 1 to 1,000,000,000. Thus, the range condition is satisfied.

2. **Modulo Condition**: The program sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. We need to check if this satisfies `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`. Let's see:
   - `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`
   - Therefore, `a_i % a_{i-1} = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) % a_{i-1}`
   - Since `(a[i-1] % a[i-1]) = 0`, the equation simplifies to `x[i-1] % a_{i-1}`.
   - For the condition to be satisfied, `x[i-1]` must be equal to `x[i-1] % a_{i-1}`. This is true if `x[i-1] < a[i-1]`.
   - Given that `a[0] = 500` and `x_i <= 500`, the condition `x[i] < a[i-1]` holds for the first iteration. For subsequent iterations, `a[i-1]` is at least 500, and `x[i-1]` is at most 500, so `x[i-1] < a[i-1]` continues to hold.

Thus, the program satisfies both conditions of the problem. Let's verify this with a few test cases to ensure correctness.

Let's run the program with the provided example input to check its output:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
