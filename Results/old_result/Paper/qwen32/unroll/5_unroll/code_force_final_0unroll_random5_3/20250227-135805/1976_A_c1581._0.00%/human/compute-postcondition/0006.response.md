To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the logic of the loop:

1. The loop iterates over each character in the `password` string along with its index `i`.
2. If the character `char` is a digit, it updates `last_digit_index` to the current index `i`.
3. If the character `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1 (meaning a digit was encountered before), the function immediately returns 'NO'.

This loop essentially checks if there is any lowercase letter in the `password` that appears after a digit. If such a letter is found, the function terminates early and returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without finding such a letter, the function does not return 'NO', and we need to determine the final state of the variables.

Since the problem specifies that we need to describe the output state only if the loop completes all iterations, we assume that no lowercase letter appears after a digit in the `password`.

Given this, the final state of the variables would be:
- `password` remains unchanged.
- `digits` remains unchanged.
- `letters` remains unchanged.
- `last_digit_index` will be the index of the last digit in the `password` string, or -1 if there are no digits in the `password`.

Since we don't have a specific `password` to determine the exact `last_digit_index`, we describe it in a general form.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string or -1 if there are no digits.**
