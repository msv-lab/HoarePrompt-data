Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles cases where two of the digits are the same but not all three. Specifically, the condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary and incorrectly excludes valid "STAIR" or "PEAK" cases where two digits are equal but not all three. For example, the input `1 1 2` should output "STAIR" because `1 < 1 < 2` is not true, but `1 == 1 < 2` is a valid "STAIR" condition. Similarly, `2 2 1` should output "PEAK" because `2 == 2 > 1` is a valid "PEAK" condition. The condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is also not sufficient to correctly identify "PEAK" cases, as it does not ensure that `a < b > c`.

Here are some test cases that demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `1 1 2`  
  Expected Output: `STAIR`  
  Actual Output: `NONE`
- Input: `2 2 1`  
  Expected Output: `PEAK`  
  Actual Output: `NONE`
- Input: `1 2 2`  
  Expected Output: `STAIR`  
  Actual Output: `NONE`
- Input: `2 1 1`  
  Expected Output: `PEAK`  
  Actual Output: `NONE`

These cases show that the program does not handle all potential inputs as specified in the problem description.
