You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is described by N lines of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where each pair can be ".." (empty cell), "R0" to "R9" (red player), "B0" to "B9" (blue player), "RG" (red goal), "BG" (blue goal), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). There is exactly one Quaffle, zero or one Bludger, and between one and five goals for each team. The number of players (P) for each team is between 1 and 10. The next line contains an integer T (0 <= T <= 10000) representing the number of steps in the game. The following T lines each describe an action in the format specified in the problem description.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (x + dx, y + dy), where x and y are both equal to a, and a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. dx and dy are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, representing the number of lines (N) and the number of columns (M) in the field, respectively. Both `a` and `b` are odd integers within the range of 3 to 99. The function returns a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`, where `x` and `y` are both equal to `a`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state and are thus unknown.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns (x + dx, y + dy), where x and y are both equal to a, and a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. dx and dy are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
