### Reasoning

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicity of each sign.

Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates from the second sign to the n-th sign. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur after the last sign's occurrence year.
   - The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that it finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it joins the results (the final `last_year` for each test case) into a single string with newline characters and writes it to standard output.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - First sign: `last_year = 3`
  - Second sign: `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
- **Output:**
  ```
  36
  ```

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for the given test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles multiple test cases, reads input correctly, processes each test case as described, and outputs the correct results.

**Correctness: True**
