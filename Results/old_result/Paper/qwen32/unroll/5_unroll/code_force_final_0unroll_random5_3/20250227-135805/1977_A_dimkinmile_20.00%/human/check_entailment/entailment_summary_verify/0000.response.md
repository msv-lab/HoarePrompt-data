Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from zero cubes.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Operations**: Each operation either adds 1 cube or removes 1 cube.
3. **Parity Consideration**: The key observation is the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves:
   - If `n` (number of moves) is even, the net effect can be to either increase or decrease the number of cubes by an even number.
   - If `n` is odd, the net effect can be to either increase or decrease the number of cubes by an odd number.

### Conditions for Possible Outcomes

- **If `m` is 0**:
  - If `n` is even, it's possible to end up with 0 cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs.
  - If `n` is odd, it's impossible to end up with 0 cubes since the net effect will always be odd.
  
- **If `m` is non-zero**:
  - If `n` is at least `m` and `n - m` is even, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes.
  - If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes since we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
  - If `n - m` is odd, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes since the net effect will always be odd.

### Analysis of the Program

The provided program checks only if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" or "No" based on this condition. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n - m`.

### Correct Logic

The correct logic should be:
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, print "Yes".
- Otherwise, print "No".

### Original Assessment

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the program's logic. The program does not consider the parity of `n - m` and thus fails to handle several valid cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
