### Reasoning:

The program aims to simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the number of test cases `T` and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Sorting:** The list `a` is sorted. Sorting helps in efficiently determining the smallest missing number (MEX) by iterating through the sorted list.

3. **Tracking Elements:** The program uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number in `a` as it iterates through the sorted list.

4. **Determining MEX:**
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, representing the current maximum number encountered.
   - As it iterates through the sorted list, it updates `cur` to the current number if it's greater than `cur` and checks if any gap exists between `cur` and the next number. If a gap is found, it breaks out of the loop as the MEX would be the next integer.
   - If no gaps are found and all numbers up to `cur` are present, it checks if the sum of counts of elements in `M` equals `n`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 because all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present, and the next integer is the MEX.
   - Finally, it checks if any number `i` in the range from 0 to `cur` has a count less than or equal to `i`. If such a number is found, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that `cur` is the smallest number not present in `c`.

5. **Output:** The program prints the value of `cur` for each test case, which represents the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Evaluation:

The program's logic correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. The sorting and counting mechanism ensures that the smallest missing non-negative integer is accurately found. The conditions checked during the iteration correctly simulate the game's outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
