The code snippet creates a list named `sum` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input, where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; The array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**
