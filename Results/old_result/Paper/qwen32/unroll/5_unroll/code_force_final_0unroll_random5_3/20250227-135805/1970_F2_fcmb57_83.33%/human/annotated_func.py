#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is described by N lines of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where each pair can be ".." (empty cell), "R0" to "R9" (red player), "B0" to "B9" (blue player), "RG" (red goal), "BG" (blue goal), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). There is exactly one Quaffle, zero or one Bludger, and between one and five goals for each team. The number of players (P) for each team is between 1 and 10. The next line contains an integer T (0 <= T <= 10000) representing the number of steps in the game. The following T lines each describe an action in the format specified in the problem description.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (x + dx, y + dy), where x and y are both equal to a, and a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. dx and dy are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field and `b` is a tuple representing a change in coordinates (dx, dy). The function returns a new tuple representing the updated coordinates by adding `dx` and `dy` to `a`. However, the provided annotations and return postconditions contain inaccuracies since `a` is not split into `x` and `y`, and `b` should be unpacked correctly. Given the actual code, the function seems to intend to return `(a + dx, a + dy)`, but the input parameters do not align with the described functionality.
