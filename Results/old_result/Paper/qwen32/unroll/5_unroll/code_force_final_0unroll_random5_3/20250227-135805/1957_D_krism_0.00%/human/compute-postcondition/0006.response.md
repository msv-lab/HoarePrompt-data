To determine the exact output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.

2. **Variable `n`:** An integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - This variable indicates the number of integers in the list `a`.

3. **List `a`:** A list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - This list is not directly used in the provided code snippet.

4. **List `arr`:** A list of integers read from the input.
   - The elements of this list are unspecified in the initial state, but we know it is a list of integers.

5. **List `prefix`:** A list of length `len(arr) + 1` where the \(i+1\)-th element is the XOR of the first \(i\) elements of `arr`.
   - This list is constructed based on the XOR operation on the elements of `arr`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The code snippet is:
```python
print(arr, prefix)
```

### Determining the Output:

1. **List `arr`:**
   - Since the exact values of the elements in `arr` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as a list of integers read from the input.
   - Let's denote the elements of `arr` as `[arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[len(arr) - 1]]`.

2. **List `prefix`:**
   - The `prefix` list is constructed such that the \(i+1\)-th element is the XOR of the first \(i\) elements of `arr`.
   - Specifically:
     - `prefix[0]` is `0` (by convention or initial value).
     - `prefix[1]` is `arr[0]`.
     - `prefix[2]` is `arr[0] ^ arr[1]`.
     - `prefix[3]` is `arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2]`.
     - And so on...

### Output Description:

Given the above, the output of the `print` statement will be the list `arr` followed by the list `prefix`.

- **`arr`:** The list of integers read from the input.
- **`prefix`:** The list where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements of `arr` up to that point.

Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the structure of `prefix` in terms of `arr`.

Output: **[arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[len(arr) - 1]], [0, arr[0], arr[0] ^ arr[1], arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2], ..., arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[len(arr) - 1]] (where arr is the list of integers read from the input and prefix is the list of cumulative XORs of the elements of arr)**
