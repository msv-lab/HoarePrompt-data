The code provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `N` is an input integer.**
