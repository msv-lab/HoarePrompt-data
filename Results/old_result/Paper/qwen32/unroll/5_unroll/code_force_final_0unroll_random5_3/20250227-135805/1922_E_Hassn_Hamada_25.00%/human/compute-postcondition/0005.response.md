To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This condition checks if \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1\) is less than or equal to `number`.

Given the initial state:
- `number` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000).
- `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.
- `size` is 1.

Let's break down the condition with the initial value of `size` (which is 1):
- `(1 << size + 1) - 1` translates to `(1 << 2) - 1`, which is \(2^2 - 1 = 3\).
- The condition then becomes `3 <= number`.

Since `number` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, it will certainly be greater than or equal to 3 for a significant portion of its range (from 3 to 1000). However, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure that `number` is at least 3.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `number` to ensure it is at least 3.

State: **`number` must be at least 3, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size` is 1**
