You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string `ans` which is a rearrangement of the characters in `s` based on the balance of parentheses up to each position in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads a single line of input which is the balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is called with the input string `s`.
   - `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty string, which will be used to build the final result.
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized with the key-value pair `{0: 0}`. This dictionary will store the balance of the prefix at each position.
   - The program then iterates through each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is `'('`, it increments the balance by 1.
     - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the balance by 1.
     - The balance at each position `i + 1` is stored in the dictionary `d`.
   - The entry for the last position `n` is removed from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is unnecessary because the balance at the last position is not needed for the final result.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values in ascending order. If two balances are the same, the positions are sorted in descending order.
   - The characters from the original string `s` are appended to `ans` in the order determined by the sorted dictionary `d`.

3. **Output:**
   - The final result `ans` is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Correctness Analysis:

- The program correctly computes the balance of the prefix at each position.
- The sorting step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules defined in the problem statement.
- The removal of the last balance entry is not necessary for correctness but does not affect the result.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
