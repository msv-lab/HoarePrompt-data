### Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX of the resulting array and Bob trying to minimize it. The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players.

Let's break down the issues:
1. **Sorting the array**: Sorting the array does not necessarily help in determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.
2. **Tracking frequencies**: The program tracks the frequency of each number in the array, but it does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal moves.
3. **Logic for determining `cur`**: The logic used to determine the final value of `cur` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the logic is incorrect:
- The program increments `cur` to the next missing number in the sorted array, but it does not account for the fact that Bob will try to minimize the MEX.
- The program checks if the sum of the frequencies of the numbers equals `S` (the size of the array) and increments `cur` if true, but this does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.
- The program checks for the presence of numbers with a frequency of 1 and sets `cur` to the second smallest such number, but this also does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
