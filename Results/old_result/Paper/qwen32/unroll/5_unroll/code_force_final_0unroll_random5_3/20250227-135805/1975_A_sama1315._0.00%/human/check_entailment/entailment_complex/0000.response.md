Reasoning:
The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The program is designed to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the given array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It uses a generator expression within the `all` function to check if every element is less than or equal to the next element. If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - The second return statement is redundant because the first `return 'Yes'` statement will always be executed if the array is sorted. The second statement is essentially a fallback, but it's not necessary since the first condition already covers all cases where the array is sorted.
   - The function returns 'No' if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second element.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `arr`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results, each on a new line.

**Correctness Analysis**:
- The problem statement asks if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing prefix-suffix swaps. However, the provided solution only checks if the array is already sorted. It does not consider whether the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.
- The allowed operation is to swap any prefix with its suffix. This operation can only change the order of elements but not their values. Therefore, the array can be sorted through such operations if and only if there exists a point in the array where the suffix can be moved to the front to make the entire array sorted.
- The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Thus, the program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
