Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight that if the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins, and if it is odd, Alice wins, aligns with the optimal strategy derived from the game rules. The annotated code confirms that the program reads the inputs correctly, computes the sum, checks its parity, and prints the correct winner for each test case.

Final: **True**
