t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and a list a. For each tuple, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and a is a list of n integers such that -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for each test case.
