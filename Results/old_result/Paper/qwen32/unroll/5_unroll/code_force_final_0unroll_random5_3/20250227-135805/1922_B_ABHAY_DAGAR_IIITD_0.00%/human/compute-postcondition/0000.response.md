Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with n being an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a being a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list. The `test_cases` variable remains unchanged as it was not modified by the provided code snippet.
