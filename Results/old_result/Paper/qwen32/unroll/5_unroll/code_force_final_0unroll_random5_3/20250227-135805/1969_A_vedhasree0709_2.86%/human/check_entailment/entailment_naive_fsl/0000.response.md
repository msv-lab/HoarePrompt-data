Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Program Output:**
```
2
```

Explanation of the example:
- Friend 1's best friend is Friend 2.
- Friend 2's best friend is Friend 3.
- Friend 3's best friend is Friend 4.
- Friend 4's best friend is Friend 1.

To have at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends. The program incorrectly outputs 2 for this case, which is not sufficient.

The program's logic is based on a very specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) that does not cover all scenarios. It fails to account for more general cases where the best friend relationships do not follow this specific pattern.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
