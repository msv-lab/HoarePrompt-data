### Reasoning:

The provided program and its annotated version appear to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the code and annotations to ensure everything aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then correctly parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the `last_year` and at a multiple of its periodicity `a[i]`.
   - It updates `last_year` to this new year.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The annotations confirm these steps and state that the program correctly handles all edge cases, such as when all signs have the same periodicity, when the periodicities are different and vary widely, and when the number of signs `n` is 1.

### Annotations Validation:

The annotations provide a detailed state of the program at key points, which align with the described logic. Specifically, the annotations mention:
- The state of variables like `input`, `data`, `index`, `T`, and `results` throughout the execution.
- The final `last_year` values for each test case are correctly appended to the `results` list.
- The output state matches the expected results for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Given the thorough analysis of the program and the annotations, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
