### Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR".
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it outputs "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case based on the conditions checked.

### Verification with Example:
Given the example input:

```
7
1 2 3
3 2 1
1 5 3
3 4 1
0 0 0
4 1 7
4 5 7
```

The program would produce the following output:

```
STAIR
NONE
PEAK
PEAK
NONE
NONE
STAIR
```

This matches the expected output as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the required logic and produces the correct output for the given problem description and example.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks the conditions for "STAIR", "PEAK", and "NONE" and prints the appropriate output for each test case.
Correctness: **True**
