You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: A series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case, based on whether the condition `curr == 0` is met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the sum of differences between each non-zero element and the last element of the list equals zero. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the issue:

The program attempts to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by checking if the cumulative difference between each element and the last element is zero. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the requirement that water can only be poured from an earlier container to a later container (i.e., i < j).

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the flaw:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The total amount of water is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is divisible by 3, so the target amount of water for each container is 2. However, it's impossible to redistribute the water such that each container has exactly 2 units of water using the allowed operation (pouring water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index).

**Program Output:**
The program would output "YES" for this test case, which is incorrect.

Here's why the program is incorrect:
- The program checks if the cumulative difference between each element and the last element is zero, which is not a valid check for the problem's requirements.
- The program does not simulate the process of pouring water from earlier containers to later containers to see if the target state can be achieved.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that at each step, we can pour water from earlier containers to later containers to reach the target amount of water in each container. The correct approach involves checking if the prefix sum of the array can be adjusted to match the target value for each container.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        prefix_sum = 0
        can_balance = True
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += nums[i]
            if prefix_sum > target * (i + 1):
                can_balance = False
                break
        print('YES' if can_balance else 'NO')

```

This corrected program correctly checks if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has the same amount of water by ensuring that the prefix sum at each step does not exceed the expected cumulative sum for that point.
