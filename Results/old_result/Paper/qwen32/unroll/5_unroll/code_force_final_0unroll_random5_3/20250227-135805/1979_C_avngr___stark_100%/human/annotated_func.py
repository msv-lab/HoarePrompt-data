#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers with at least one element.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: `result` is the sum of all elements in `numbers`.
    return result
    #The program returns the sum of all elements in the list `numbers`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers with at least one element and returns the sum of all elements in the list.
