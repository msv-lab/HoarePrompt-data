Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of pairs) and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list, picking every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...). This ensures that the smaller element of each pair is chosen for the score, as the list is sorted.
   - These chosen elements are summed up to get the final score for each test case.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the score for each test case.

This approach is optimal because sorting the list ensures that the smallest possible numbers are always paired together, maximizing the sum of the minimums. Therefore, the program is correct.
