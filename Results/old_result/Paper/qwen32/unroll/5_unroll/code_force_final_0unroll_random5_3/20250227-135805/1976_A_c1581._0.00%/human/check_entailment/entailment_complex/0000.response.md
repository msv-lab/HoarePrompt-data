### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as per the problem description.

1. **Digit and Letter Separation and Checking Order:**
   - The function `func_1` separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It checks if there is any letter that comes after a digit. If so, it immediately returns "NO".
   - This ensures that all digits come before any letters, satisfying the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

2. **Sorting Check:**
   - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either of these lists is not sorted, the function returns "NO".

3. **Return "YES":**
   - If all the conditions are satisfied (digits before letters, both lists sorted), the function returns "YES".

### Verification Against the Example:

Let's verify the function with the provided examples:

1. **Password "12ac":**
   - Digits: [1, 2], Letters: [a, c]
   - Digits are sorted, Letters are sorted, and all digits come before letters.
   - Output: "YES"

2. **Password "123wa":**
   - Digits: [1, 2, 3], Letters: [w, a]
   - Digits are sorted, but letters are not sorted.
   - Output: "NO"

3. **Password "allllmost":**
   - Digits: [], Letters: [a, l, l, l, l, m, o, s, t]
   - Letters are sorted.
   - Output: "YES"

4. **Password "ac123":**
   - Digits: [1, 2, 3], Letters: [a, c]
   - Digits are sorted, Letters are sorted, but there are digits after letters.
   - Output: "NO"

5. **Password "011679":**
   - Digits: [0, 1, 1, 6, 7, 9], Letters: []
   - Digits are sorted.
   - Output: "YES"

The function correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if a password is strong according to the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
