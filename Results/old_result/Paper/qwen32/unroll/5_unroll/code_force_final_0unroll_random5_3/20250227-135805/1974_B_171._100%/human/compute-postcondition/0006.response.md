Output State: **The program returns a string `decoded` of length `n` where each character is the reverse counterpart of the corresponding character in `encoded` as per `char_map`.**

This means that each character in the `decoded` string corresponds to a character in the `encoded` string, transformed according to the mapping defined in `char_map`. Since `char_map` maps each unique character in `encoded` to its reverse counterpart in the sorted list `unique_chars`, the `decoded` string is essentially the `encoded` string with each character replaced by its mapped value.
