Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to verify strong passwords as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then interprets the first element as the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1(password)` is called for each password.
   - Inside `func_1`, two lists, `digits` and `letters`, are initialized to store digits and letters separately.
   - The program iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - The variable `last_digit_index` keeps track of the last position of a digit in the password.
   - The program iterates over the password again:
     - If a digit is found, it updates `last_digit_index`.
     - If a letter is found after a digit (`last_digit_index` is not -1), it immediately returns "NO" because this violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
   - After checking the order of digits and letters, the program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order and if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Verification Against the Problem Statement:

- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
  - The program does not explicitly check this condition, but since the input is assumed to be valid, we can assume this condition is met.
  
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
  - The program correctly implements this by tracking the last digit's position and checking if any letter appears after it.
  
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The program correctly checks this by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.
  
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The program correctly checks this by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem statement for verifying strong passwords. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
