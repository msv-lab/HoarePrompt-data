You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

    #State: For each test case, it prints 'YES' if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the given constraints (bullets and time), otherwise it prints 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `healths`, `positions`, `monsters`, `total_bullets_used`, and `success` are in their final states after processing all test cases, but since they are loop variables, their specific values are not preserved outside the loop. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases, and the input values for each test case are processed independently.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of monsters `n`, a maximum number of bullets `k`, a list of monster healths, and a list of their positions. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters using the bullets within the time constraints based on their positions and healths, and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining whether you can kill all monsters before they reach your character. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that you can distribute your bullets among multiple monsters in each second, and it does not correctly calculate the time available to kill each monster.

Here’s a detailed explanation of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Time Available**: The program calculates the time available to kill a monster as the absolute value of its position. However, this does not account for the fact that the monster's position changes each second. For example, a monster at position -3 will take 3 seconds to reach you, but during those 3 seconds, you can fire bullets at it each second.

2. **Incorrect Bullet Distribution**: The program sums up the total bullets needed to kill all monsters and checks if this sum is less than or equal to the total time available. However, it does not consider that you can distribute your bullets across multiple seconds. For example, if you have 3 bullets and two monsters, each requiring 2 bullets to kill, the program would incorrectly conclude that you cannot kill both monsters because 4 bullets are needed, but you can actually kill one monster in the first 2 seconds and the other in the next 2 seconds.

3. **No Consideration of Bullet Limit per Second**: The program does not take into account the limit `k` on the number of bullets you can fire per second. It simply checks if the total number of bullets needed is less than or equal to the total time available, without considering how many bullets you can fire in each second.

### Counterexample

Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 1
1 1
-1 1
```

- **Monsters**: 
  - Monster 1: Health = 1, Position = -1
  - Monster 2: Health = 1, Position = 1

- **Analysis**:
  - Monster 1 will reach you in 1 second.
  - Monster 2 will reach you in 1 second.
  - You can kill both monsters in 1 second by firing 1 bullet at each monster.

The program will incorrectly conclude that you cannot kill both monsters because it will sum the bullets needed (2) and compare it to the total time available (1), which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the process of firing bullets and moving monsters over time, ensuring that you do not exceed the bullet limit per second and that you kill all monsters before they reach you. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_survive(n, k, healths, positions):
    monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
    for position, health in monsters:
        distance = abs(position)
        while health > 0:
            if k == 0:
                return False
            health -= k
            distance -= 1
            if distance < 0:
                return False
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if can_survive(n, k, healths, positions):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version properly simulates the process of firing bullets and moving monsters, ensuring that you do not exceed the bullet limit per second and that you kill all monsters before they reach you.
