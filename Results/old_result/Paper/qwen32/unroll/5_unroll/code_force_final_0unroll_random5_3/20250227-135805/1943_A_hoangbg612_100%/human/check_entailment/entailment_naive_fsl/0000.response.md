Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for the given problem. Specifically, the strategy used by the program to determine the final score (MEX) does not account for the optimal moves by both players.

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the MEX by iterating through the sorted list and keeping track of the smallest missing number. However, it does not correctly simulate the turns between Alice and Bob and does not account for the optimal strategies each player would use.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should aim to leave the smallest possible numbers for Bob to remove.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should aim to remove the smallest numbers that Alice leaves.
   - The provided program does not simulate this back-and-forth strategy and instead calculates a MEX based on a single pass through the sorted list.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Consider the case where the array `a` contains repeated elements. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice and Bob take turns removing elements in an optimal manner.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a test case:

**Test Case**:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Explanation**:
- Alice starts by picking `0`, then `1`, and then `2`.
- Bob picks one of the remaining `2` and `3`.
- The final array `c` will be `[0, 1, 2]` or `[0, 1, 3]`, both of which have a MEX of `2`.

**Program Output**:
- The program might output `1` or some other incorrect value because it does not simulate the optimal turns between Alice and Bob.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the final score based on optimal play by both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
