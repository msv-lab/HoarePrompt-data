The provided code snippet only includes the assignment `input = sys.stdin.read`. This line of code does not affect the `array` variable or any other variables that were previously defined. It simply reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`, which is a function that reads all input until EOF (End of File) is reached. Since no further operations are performed on `array` or any other variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **array is a list of integers with length n (2 <= n <= 100), and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The built-in `input` function is now `sys.stdin.read`.**
