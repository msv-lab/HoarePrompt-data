Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it processes the list of integers using an undefined function `func_1` and stores the result. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.**
