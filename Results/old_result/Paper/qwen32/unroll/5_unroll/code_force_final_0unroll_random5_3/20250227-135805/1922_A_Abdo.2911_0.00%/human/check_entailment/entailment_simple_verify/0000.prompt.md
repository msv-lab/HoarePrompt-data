You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it constructs a template based on the strings `a` and `b`. The template construction rules are:
- If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the corresponding character in the template is the same lowercase character.
- If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, the corresponding character in the template is the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`, since they are different).

After constructing the template, the program checks:
- Whether both `a` and `b` match the template.
- Whether `c` does not match the template.

### Correctness Check

Let's go through the logic of the program and see if it handles all edge cases and matches the problem description.

#### Template Construction
The template construction is done correctly. If characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the lowercase character to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`).

#### Matching Check
The program then checks if `a` and `b` match the template:
- If the template character is lowercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to the template character.
- If the template character is uppercase, it checks if neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of the template character.

Next, it checks if `c` does not match the template:
- If the template character is lowercase, it checks if `c[i]` is not equal to the template character.
- If the template character is uppercase, it checks if `c[i]` is not equal to the lowercase version of the template character.

### Edge Cases
Let's consider a few edge cases:
1. **All characters in `a` and `b` are the same:**
   - Template will be all lowercase.
   - `c` can be different or same, but if it's same, it will not match.
2. **All characters in `a` and `b` are different:**
   - Template will be all uppercase.
   - `c` can be any combination, but if it matches the lowercase version of any character in the template, it will not match.
3. **Mixed characters in `a` and `b`:**
   - Template will have a mix of lowercase and uppercase.
   - `c` must not match the template exactly as described.

### Conclusion
The program correctly constructs the template and checks if `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. It handles all edge cases as per the problem description.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly constructs the template based on the rules provided and checks if `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. It handles all edge cases, including when all characters in `a` and `b` are the same, all are different, or mixed.
