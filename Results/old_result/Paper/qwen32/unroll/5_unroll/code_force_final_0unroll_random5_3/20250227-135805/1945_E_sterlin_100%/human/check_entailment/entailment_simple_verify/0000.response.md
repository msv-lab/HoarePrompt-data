### Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the provided code does not implement the solution to the problem. Let's analyze the annotated code to understand its behavior and validate if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading Functions (`func_1` to `func_5`)**:
   - These functions are utility functions to read input in different formats. They are correctly implemented and used to read the number of test cases, the values of `n` and `x`, and the permutation `p`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The annotated code reads the input and processes each test case individually.
   - It creates a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index.
   - It initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n` (the length of the permutation).
   - It performs a binary search-like process to narrow down the range where `x` might be located.
   - If `p[left]` is equal to `x`, it outputs `0` because no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not seen during the binary search process, it outputs `1` and suggests a swap to bring `x` to the position where `p[left]` is currently located.
   - If `x` is seen but `p[left]` is not equal to `x`, it performs two swaps to position `x` correctly.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is modified to work with the unsorted permutation. The loop continues until `right - left` is 1, and it updates `left` or `right` based on the comparison of `p[mid]` with `x`.
   - The `seen` list keeps track of which elements have been encountered during the binary search process.

4. **Output**:
   - The code correctly outputs the number of swaps needed (0, 1, or 2) and the indices of the elements to swap.

### Validation:
- The annotated code correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. It handles the test cases as specified and produces the required output.
- The logic for determining the swaps is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the provided code does correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct number of swaps and the indices of the elements to swap.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
