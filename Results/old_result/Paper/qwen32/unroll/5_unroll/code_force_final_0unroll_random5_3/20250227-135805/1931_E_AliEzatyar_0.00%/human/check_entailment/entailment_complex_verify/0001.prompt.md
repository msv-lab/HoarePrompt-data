You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers n and m, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers and a list of integers. It returns the count of trailing '0' strings from the end of the list, but due to the current implementation, it always returns 0 regardless of the input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Analysis of the Problem

The problem involves a game between Sasha and Anna. The game rules are as follows:
1. Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number (leading zeros are discarded).
2. Sasha concatenates two numbers in any order and inserts the result back into the list.
3. The game ends when only one number remains in the list.
4. Sasha wins if this number is not less than \(10^m\).

### Analysis of the Program

The given program attempts to determine the winner based on the number of digits in the numbers and the number of trailing zeros in the numbers. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \(n\) and the integer \(m\).
   - It then reads the list of integers as strings.

2. **Calculating Total Digits and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in all numbers.
   - It calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and stores these counts in a list `zeros`.

3. **Sorting and Summing Trailing Zeros:**
   - The list `zeros` is sorted in descending order.
   - The program sums every other element in this sorted list starting from the first element. This sum is stored in `subtract_zero`.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program calculates the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero`.
   - If this difference is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Flaws in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The program's logic for determining the winner is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game or account for the optimal moves of both players.
   - The number of trailing zeros and their manipulation does not directly determine the final number's magnitude after all moves.
   - The program does not consider the optimal concatenation strategy of Sasha.

2. **Incorrect Output String:**
   - The program outputs 'Sashah' instead of 'Sasha' if Sasha wins.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the list contains only one number or where the numbers are very small or very large.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine the winner based on the rules of the game. It uses an incorrect approach and logic to determine the winner.

### Correctness

Correctness: **False**
