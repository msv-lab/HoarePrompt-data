The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., not zero), the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be a non-zero value. Since `n` is already described as an input integer, we need to ensure it's not zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero input integer; the value of `s` is printed for each of the original `n` test cases.**
