### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to decode a string `b` that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The decoding process involves the following steps:

1. **Construct the Auxiliary String `r`:** 
   - Identify all distinct characters in `b` and sort them in alphabetical order to form the string `r`.

2. **Create a Mapping (`char_map`):**
   - For each character in `r`, map it to its symmetric character in `r`. This means that the first character in `r` maps to the last character in `r`, the second character in `r` maps to the second last character in `r`, and so on.

3. **Decode the String `b`:**
   - Replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map` to form the original string `s`.

Let's analyze the provided function `func_1(b)`:

- **Step 1:** The function first constructs the set of unique characters in `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
- **Step 2:** It then creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. However, there is an issue with the mapping logic. The code maps each character in `r` to a character from 'a' to 'z' in descending order, which is incorrect. Instead, it should map each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` directly.
- **Step 3:** The function then constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

The correct way to create the mapping (`char_map`) should be:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))  # This will give us the string `r`
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    return s
```

In this corrected version:
- `unique_chars` is the sorted list of unique characters in `b`, which is the string `r`.
- `char_map` correctly maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
- The function then constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

Since the provided function does not correctly map characters in `r` to their symmetric characters in `r`, it will not produce the correct decoded string `s`.

### Correctness: **False**
