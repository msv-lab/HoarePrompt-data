The code `obj[1] += 1` increments the second element of the list `obj` by 1. The initial state specifies that `obj` is a list containing two integers representing coordinates, and `d` is a string that can be 'U', 'L', or 'R', with the current value of `d` being 'R'. Since only the second element of `obj` is modified, the first element remains unchanged. The value of `d` remains 'R' as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`obj` is a list containing two integers where the second integer is incremented by 1, and `d` is 'R'.**
