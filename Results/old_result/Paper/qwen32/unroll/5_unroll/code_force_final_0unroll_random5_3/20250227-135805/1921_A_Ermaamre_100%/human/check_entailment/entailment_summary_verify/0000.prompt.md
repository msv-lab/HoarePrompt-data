You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 2

    1 -1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 -1
    
    45 11
    
    45 39
    
    17 11
    
    17 39

    4
    784

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It then calculates and prints the area of each square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and then squaring this difference. However, this approach does not correctly account for the side length of the square, which could be determined by the y-coordinates as well. The side length of the square should be the maximum of the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

Let's consider a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
0 0
0 5
5 0
5 5
```

Expected Output:
```
25
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
25
```

This specific case works because the side length is determined by the x-coordinates. However, consider another case:

Input:
```
1
0 0
5 0
0 5
5 5
```

Expected Output:
```
25
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
25
```

This case also works because the side length is determined by the x-coordinates. However, consider a case where the side length is determined by the y-coordinates:

Input:
```
1
0 0
5 0
0 5
5 5
```

Expected Output:
```
25
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
25
```

This case works as well, but consider the following case:

Input:
```
1
0 0
0 10
10 0
10 10
```

Expected Output:
```
100
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
100
```

This case works as well, but consider the following case:

Input:
```
1
0 0
10 0
0 15
10 15
```

Expected Output:
```
150
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
100
```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the area as 100, whereas the correct area should be 150, because the side length is determined by the y-coordinates (15).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle cases where the side length of the square is determined by the y-coordinates.
