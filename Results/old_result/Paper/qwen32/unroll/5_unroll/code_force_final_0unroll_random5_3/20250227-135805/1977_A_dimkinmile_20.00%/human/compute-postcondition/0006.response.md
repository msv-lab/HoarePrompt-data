To provide the functionality description for the function `func_1` given the constraints and the expected output, let's break down the provided information:

- The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition, but the description indicates that for each test case, there are integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases denoted by `t` (1 <= t <= 100).

Given this, the functionality can be described as follows:

The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, where both are within the range of 1 to 100 inclusive. For each test case, the function performs some operation (not detailed here) and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Since the specific operation and the return value for each test case are not detailed, we can only describe the input and the general behavior of handling multiple test cases.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). For each test case, it performs an operation and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
