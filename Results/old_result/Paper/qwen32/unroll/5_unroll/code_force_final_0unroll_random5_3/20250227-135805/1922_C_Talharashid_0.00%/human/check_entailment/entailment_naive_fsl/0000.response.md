Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by precomputing the minimum cost to travel from each city to the end of the list (both forward and backward) using the closest city rule. However, the logic for computing these costs is flawed, and the program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the cost to travel from one city to another by summing up the costs of traveling to the closest city. However, this does not necessarily give the minimum cost to travel directly from one city to another.
   - The logic for determining the closest city and calculating the cost is flawed. For example, the program does not correctly handle the case where the closest city is not the next or previous city in the list.

2. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program attempts to use precomputed costs to answer each query, but these precomputed costs are not correctly calculated. Therefore, the answers to the queries are incorrect.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Let's consider a simple example:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For the query `1 4`: The minimum cost is 3 coins (travel from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4).
- For the query `1 5`: The minimum cost is 8 coins (travel from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 5).
- For the query `3 4`: The minimum cost is 1 coin (travel directly from 3 to 4).
- For the query `3 2`: The minimum cost is 4 coins (travel from 3 to 2).
- For the query `5 1`: The minimum cost is 14 coins (travel from 5 to 4, 4 to 3, 3 to 2, and 2 to 1).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will likely output incorrect values because the precomputed costs are not correctly calculated.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for traveling between cities for all possible queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
