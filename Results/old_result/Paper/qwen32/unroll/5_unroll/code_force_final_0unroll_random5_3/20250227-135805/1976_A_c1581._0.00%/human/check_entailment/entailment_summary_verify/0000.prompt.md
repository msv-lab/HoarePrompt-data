You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function checks if a given password string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, meets specific criteria: all digits must appear before any letters, and both digits and letters must be in non-decreasing order. If the password meets these criteria, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly. The function `func_1` does not check if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order when they are the only characters in the password. However, the code does check for the conditions involving both letters and digits, and it handles the case where a digit comes after a letter correctly.

Let's consider the following test cases:

1. **Password with only digits**: "12345" should return "YES" because the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Password with only letters**: "abcde" should return "YES" because the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Password with only digits but not sorted**: "54321" should return "NO" because the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Password with only letters but not sorted**: "edcba" should return "NO" because the letters are not sorted in non-decreasing order.

The current implementation does not explicitly check these conditions for passwords consisting only of digits or only of letters. However, it implicitly handles the case where the password consists only of digits or only of letters because the `sorted` function will return the same list if the list is already sorted, and the conditions for digits coming after letters are not violated in these cases.

To ensure correctness, we can add explicit checks for these conditions. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits and digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters and letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))
```

In this corrected version, we added checks to ensure that the digits and letters are sorted only if they are present in the password. This ensures that passwords consisting only of digits or only of letters are handled correctly.
