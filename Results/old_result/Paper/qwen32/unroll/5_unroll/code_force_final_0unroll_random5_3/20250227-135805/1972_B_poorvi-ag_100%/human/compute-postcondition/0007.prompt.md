You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters "U" and "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `s` for each test case remain unchanged; `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` is odd or even.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: results is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` is odd or even. The variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `s` for each test case also remain unchanged. The loop has printed each element of the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "U" and "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down). For each test case, the function returns the number of pairs of adjacent coins that are in the same state (both "U" or both "D").

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
