Reasoning:  
The given Python program is not correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary. The program's logic does not align with the problem's requirements. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program does not correctly implement the logic for adding new problems and removing the most difficult one. Instead of inserting a new problem difficulty `w` and sorting the list `a`, the program incorrectly inserts `b[j]` directly into `a` at the position `i` and then removes the last element. This does not simulate the actual process of adding and removing problems as described in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` defined at the end of the program is not used anywhere in the code and appears to be unrelated to solving the problem. Moreover, it sorts the array in descending order, which is contrary to the requirement of keeping the difficulties in non-decreasing order.
3. The loop logic does not ensure that the minimum number of new problems is added. The program does not attempt to find the optimal value `w` for each new problem; instead, it tries to fit the values from `b` directly into `a`, which is not the intended approach.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
