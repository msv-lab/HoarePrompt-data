The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Specifically, the loop will execute `t` times. The state of `n`, `a`, and any other variables outside the loop head do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`. Since the problem states that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. The initial state already satisfies this condition, so no adjustment is needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.**
