Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `b` is a list of `m` integers (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ m), `n` is the length of list `a`, and `m` is the length of list `b`. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `good_subarrays` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `good_subarrays` has been initialized to 0, while all other variables (`a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, and `m`) retain their initial values and properties as described.
