### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after the array has been rearranged. The beauty of the array can be maximized by sorting the array. When the array is sorted, the difference between consecutive elements is maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To compute the beauty of an array after sorting it.
   - **Implementation**: The function sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Correctness**: The implementation correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty as described. Sorting ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, thus the beauty is maximized.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and then printing the results.
   - **Implementation**: The function reads all input at once, parses the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself. It then calls `func_1` to compute the beauty of the array and stores the result. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness**: The implementation correctly processes multiple test cases, reads the input as specified, and uses `func_1` to compute the beauty for each test case. It then prints the results as required.

### Conclusion:

- **Function `func_1`** correctly computes the maximum beauty of an array by sorting it and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
- **Function `func_2`** correctly handles multiple test cases, reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

Therefore, the program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles the input-output requirements as specified.

### Correctness: **True**
