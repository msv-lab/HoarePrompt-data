The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be reduced to all zeros by applying specific operations: subtracting twice the current element from the next element and the current element from the element after next, while ensuring no element becomes negative. It outputs 'YES' if the list can be reduced to all zeros, otherwise 'NO'.
