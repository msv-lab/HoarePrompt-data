The provided code snippet only initializes a string variable `alpha` with the lowercase English alphabet. No other variables are modified or introduced, and no calculations or conditions are executed. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the addition of the `alpha` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each of the t test cases: n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n; a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `YES` is 'YES'; `NO` is 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
