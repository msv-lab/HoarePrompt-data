### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and then the array itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a`.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits it into its tens and units digits.
   - The logic for splitting and appending digits to the new list `c` is somewhat flawed:
     - It checks if the tens digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if `i > 0`).
     - If `y` is less than or equal to the units digit `x`, it appends both `y` and `x` to `c`.
     - Otherwise, it appends the original number.
     - For the first element (`i == 0`), it directly appends the digits if `y` is less than or equal to `x`; otherwise, it appends the original number.
   - If the element is not greater than 10, it simply appends the element to `c`.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the new list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints "YES" for each test case where `b[i]` is `1` and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for splitting and appending digits to `c` is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the conditions for splitting and appending digits.
- The program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted or can be sorted by splitting numbers correctly.
- The program does not consider all possible ways to split numbers and re-arrange the array to achieve a sorted order.

### Example:
Let's consider the second example from the problem statement:

```
3
12 28 5
```

- The program will process `12` and `28` by splitting them into digits.
- However, the logic for appending the digits is flawed, and it may not correctly determine if the array can be sorted.
- For this specific example, the program might incorrectly determine that the array cannot be sorted, leading to an incorrect output of "NO".

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic for splitting and appending digits, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

**Correctness: False**
