You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if a given password, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, meets specific criteria. It returns 'NO' if the lowercase letters or digits in the password are not sorted individually or if a lowercase letter is immediately followed by a digit. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly identify passwords where the digits come after a letter. The current implementation only checks if the first letter is followed by a digit, but it should ensure that no digit appears after any letter in the password.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
abc12
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```

In this case, the password "abc12" contains digits after letters, which violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter. The program should return "NO" for this input, but it returns "YES".

To fix this, the program should ensure that once a digit is encountered, no letters should follow it. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    seen_digit = False
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            seen_digit = True
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            if seen_digit:
                return 'NO'
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected version introduces a `seen_digit` flag to ensure that no letters appear after any digit in the password.
