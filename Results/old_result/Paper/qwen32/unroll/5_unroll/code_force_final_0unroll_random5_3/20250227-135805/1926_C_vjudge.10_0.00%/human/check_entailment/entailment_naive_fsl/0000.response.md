Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description.

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The outer loop runs `N` times, where `N` is the number of test cases. However, the inner loop iterates from 0 to `n-1` (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`), and it should actually iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) as per the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1(i)` is called inside the inner loop, but the function is not defined until after the loop. This will cause a `NameError`.

3. **Accumulating Incorrectly**: The variable `soma` is used to accumulate the sum across all test cases, but it should be reset for each test case.

4. **Output Format**: The problem description specifies that the output for each test case should be printed separately, but the current code prints the final accumulated sum after all test cases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    return sum(sum(int(d) for d in str(i)) for i in range(1, n + 1))

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    print(sum_of_digit_sums(n))
```

This corrected version:
- Defines the function `sum_of_digit_sums` to calculate the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to `n`.
- Reads the number of test cases `T`.
- For each test case, reads `n`, calculates the sum of the digit sums using `sum_of_digit_sums(n)`, and prints the result.
