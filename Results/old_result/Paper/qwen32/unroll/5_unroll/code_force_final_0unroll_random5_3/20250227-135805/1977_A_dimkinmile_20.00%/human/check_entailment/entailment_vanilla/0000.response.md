Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
2. The key observation is that the difference between `n` (number of moves) and `m` (number of cubes) must be non-negative and even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, so to end up with exactly `m` cubes, the total number of additions must be exactly `m` and the total number of removals must be `n - m`. For this to be possible, `n - m` must be non-negative (indicating that we have enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes) and even (indicating that we can balance the additions and removals to end up with exactly `m` cubes).
3. The provided program, however, only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and does not consider whether `n - m` is even. This means that the program will incorrectly output "Yes" for cases where `n - m` is odd, even though it's not possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes in such cases.

For example, for the input `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the program will output "Yes" because `n >= m`, but it is not possible to end up with exactly 1 cube after 2 moves (we could end up with 0 or 2 cubes, but not 1).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
