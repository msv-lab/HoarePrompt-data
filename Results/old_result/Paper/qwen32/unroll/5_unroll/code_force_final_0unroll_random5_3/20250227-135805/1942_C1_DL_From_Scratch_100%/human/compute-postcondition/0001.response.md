In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `T` which is the number of iterations. The loop will execute if `T` is at least 1. The other variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen do not directly affect whether the loop will execute or not; they are used within the loop body.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `T`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers should remain as they are described.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5); `y` is 0; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `T` is at least 1. Therefore, the adjusted state focusing only on the loop head is:

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4**
