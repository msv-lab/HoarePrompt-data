`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 10^4. Other variables such as `n`, `a`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they have not been affected by this input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each of the m queries, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely.**
