Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list represents a test case starting with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) indicating the number of containers, followed by `n` integers representing the amounts of water in the containers. The function returns 'NO' if a certain condition is not met, and 'YES' if the condition is satisfied.**
