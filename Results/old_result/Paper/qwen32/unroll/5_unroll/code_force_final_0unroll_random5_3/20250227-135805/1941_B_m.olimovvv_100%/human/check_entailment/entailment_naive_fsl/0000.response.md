Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations. There are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `a - 2`, but the operation involves indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. The loop should start from `1` to `a - 2` to correctly apply the operation.
   - The operation `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` are incorrect because they do not correctly simulate the described operation. Specifically, `b[i]` should be reduced by 1, `b[i+1]` by 2, and `b[i+2]` by 1.

2. **Negative Values Handling:**
   - The program checks if `b[i] < 0` and prints 'NO' if true. However, this check is misplaced and incorrect. The array elements should not be negative, but the operation itself should ensure that the array elements remain non-negative.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0` is not sufficient to determine if all elements are zero. It should check if all elements in the array are zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If the first or last element is not zero, it's impossible to make all elements zero
        if a[0] != 0 or a[-1] != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to make all elements zero using the operation
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            op = min(a[i] // 2, a[i - 1], a[i + 1])
            a[i - 1] -= op
            a[i] -= 2 * op
            a[i + 1] -= op
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

```

This corrected version properly applies the operation and checks if all elements can be made zero. The original program fails to correctly simulate the operation and does not handle all edge cases.
