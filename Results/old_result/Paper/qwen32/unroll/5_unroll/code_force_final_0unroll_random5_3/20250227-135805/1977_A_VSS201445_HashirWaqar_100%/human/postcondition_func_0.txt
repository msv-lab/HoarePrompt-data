The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it checks if the integer `n` is greater than or equal to the integer `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. It prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged after processing each test case.
