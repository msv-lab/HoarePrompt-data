Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly performs the decoding task as described in the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - Construct a new string `r` from the distinct letters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given the encoded string `b`, we need to reverse the encoding process to retrieve the original string `s`.
   - This involves mapping each character in `b` back to its original character in `s` based on the symmetric mapping defined by `r`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Building the Character Map:**
     - The program constructs a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form `r`.
     - For each character `c` in `r`, it calculates its symmetric character in `r` and stores the mapping in `char_map`.
     - The symmetric character of `c` is determined by `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should map `c` to the character at the symmetric position in `r`, not in the alphabet.
   - **Decoding the String:**
     - The program constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Symmetric Mapping:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the symmetric character by using the length of `b` instead of the length of `r`. This leads to incorrect mappings.
  - The correct approach is to map each character `c` in `r` to the character at the symmetric position in `r`, not in the alphabet.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the program, we need to correctly map each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the wrong method of calculating the symmetric character. The corrected version of the program is provided above.

Correctness: **False**
