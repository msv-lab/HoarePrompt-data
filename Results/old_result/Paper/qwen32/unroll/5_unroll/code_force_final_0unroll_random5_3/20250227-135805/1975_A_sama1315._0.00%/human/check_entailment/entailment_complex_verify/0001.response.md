### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the problem requires determining if the array can be sorted using the specified operation (swapping a prefix and suffix), which allows for more complex rearrangements.

Let's break down the key points:

1. **Operation Effect**: The operation allows for splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. This means that if we can find a point in the array where it can be split into two non-decreasing subarrays such that the last element of the first subarray is less than or equal to the first element of the second subarray, the array can be sorted.

2. **Checking the Condition**: The correct approach involves finding a point in the array where the sequence can be split into two non-decreasing parts. This means we need to find a point where the array stops increasing and then continues increasing again. The original `func_1` does not implement this logic.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[3, 1, 2]`, the correct logic would identify that it can be split into `[3]` and `[1, 2]`, swapped to `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.
   - The original `func_1` would return 'No' because the array is not already sorted.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the logic, we need to find a point where the array can be split into two non-decreasing subarrays such that the last element of the first subarray is less than or equal to the first element of the second subarray. Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the array can be split at index i
        if all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i)) and all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i, n - 1)) and (i == 0 or arr[i - 1] <= arr[i]):
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in `func_1`. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
