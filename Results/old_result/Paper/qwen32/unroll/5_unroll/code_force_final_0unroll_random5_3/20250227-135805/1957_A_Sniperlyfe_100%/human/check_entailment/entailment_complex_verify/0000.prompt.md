You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary where each unique integer in `arr` is a key, and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input, where the first integer `t` indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. The function calculates and returns the sum of how many complete sets of three sticks can be formed from each unique stick length across all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. The current implementation only considers polygons with 3 sides (triangles) because it divides the frequency of each stick length by 3. However, the problem statement allows for polygons with any number of sides, not just triangles.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation: With six sticks of the same length, we can form one hexagon (6-sided polygon).

However, the given program will output `2` because it calculates the number of triangles that can be formed (since `6 // 3 = 2`).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider polygons with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. For each unique stick length, the program should determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using that stick length. This involves checking for all possible polygon side lengths (from 3 up to the frequency of the stick length) and selecting the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    max_polygons = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        for sides in range(3, count + 1):
            max_polygons += count // sides
            count %= sides
    return max_polygons
```

This corrected version checks all possible polygon side lengths and calculates the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each unique stick length.
