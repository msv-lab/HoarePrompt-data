The code snippet `data = input().split()` takes the entire input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means that `data` will be a list containing the first line and the second line of the input, with each number in the second line being a separate element in the list.

Given the initial state, where `input` is a string containing the entire input, after executing the code, `data` will be a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` (the number of signs), and the subsequent elements are the string representations of the periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Output State: **`input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list where `data[0]` is the string representation of `n` and `data[1:]` are the string representations of `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.**
