To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given code snippet for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

1. For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of elements in the array `a`.
2. It then reads `n-1` integers which are the elements of the array `x`.
3. An array `a` of size `n` is initialized with all elements set to 0.
4. The first element of `a` is set to 500.
5. For each subsequent element in `a` (from index 1 to n-1), the value is computed as the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
6. The array `a` is then printed.

The loop iterates over the number of test cases, and for each test case, it computes and prints the array `a` as described.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to consider the final state of all the printed arrays `a` for each test case. However, the problem does not ask for the combined state of all arrays but the state after the loop finishes executing all test cases. The state of the variables `n`, `x`, and `a` is local to each iteration of the loop and does not persist across different test cases.

Thus, after all the test cases have been processed, the state of the variables `n`, `x`, and `a` is not retained because they are re-initialized for each test case. The only output is the printed arrays `a` for each test case.

Since the problem asks for the output state in a specific format, and given that the state of variables `n`, `x`, and `a` is not retained, we can describe the output state as the sequence of printed arrays `a` for each test case.

However, if we strictly follow the format requested and consider that the output state pertains to the final state of the variables in the context of the loop, we can conclude that the variables `n`, `x`, and `a` do not have a defined state after the loop finishes as they are local to each iteration.

Given the format requested, we can state:

Output State: **The output state consists of the printed arrays `a` for each test case, with no retained state of variables `n`, `x`, and `a` after the loop finishes.**
