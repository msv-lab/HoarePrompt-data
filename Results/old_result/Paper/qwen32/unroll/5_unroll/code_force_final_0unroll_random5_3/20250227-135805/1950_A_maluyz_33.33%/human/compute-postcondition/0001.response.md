For the given task, we need to ensure that the `for` loop can execute based on the objects in its head. The loop head is `for i in range(t)`, so we need to focus on the variable `t` and ensure it allows the loop to run.

Given that `t` is already described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, this means `t` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute at least once (since `t` is at least 1). Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary for the loop to execute.

The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are mentioned in the context of each test case but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute, and no modifications are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
