### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated version against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The regular price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The promotion price for two yogurts is `b` burles.
- The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Annotations:
Annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- `n` is the number of test cases.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are the number of yogurts, the regular price, and the promotion price, respectively.
- `d` is calculated as `c / 2`.
- The program compares `a * b` with `a * d`.

#### Issues Identified in the Provided Program:
1. **Misunderstanding of Promotion Price**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is incorrect. `d` should not be used as it is not the price per yogurt under promotion.
   - The program incorrectly compares `a * b` with `a * d`. It seems to assume `a * b` is the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the regular price, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Promotion Usage**:
   - The program does not correctly determine how to use the promotion to minimize cost.
   - It does not account for the optimal number of pairs of yogurts to buy at the promotion price and the cost of any remaining yogurt.

3. **Handling Odd Numbers of Yogurts**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `n` is odd correctly. For example, if `n` is 3, it should buy two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price.

#### Corrected Version:
The corrected version provided in the original assessment properly handles the promotion and minimizes the cost:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts to buy at promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the cost for these pairs
        cost = pairs * b
        # If there is an odd number of yogurts, add the cost of one more yogurt
        if n % 2 != 0:
            cost += a
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Evaluation:
The original assessment is **correct** in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost by not properly utilizing the promotion and not handling odd numbers of yogurts correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
