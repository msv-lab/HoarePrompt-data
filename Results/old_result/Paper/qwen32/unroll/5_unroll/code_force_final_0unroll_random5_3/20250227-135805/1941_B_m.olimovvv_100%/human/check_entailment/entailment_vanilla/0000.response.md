Let's analyze the provided Python program based on the problem description to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `b` of integers.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `a-3` (i.e., `0` to `n-3`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the following operations:
     - It checks if `b[i]` is negative. If it is, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop. However, since the problem guarantees that all elements are non-negative, this check is unnecessary.
     - It updates `b[i+1]`, `b[i+2]`, and `b[i]` based on the described operation.
   
3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are zero. If not, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
   
4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The program's logic is flawed. The operations performed on the array do not correctly simulate the problem's requirements. Specifically, the operations `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`, `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`, and `b[i] -= b[i]` do not correspond to the operation described in the problem where `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`, `a_i = a_i - 2`, and `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`. Instead, these operations seem to be attempting to zero out the array elements in a way that doesn't align with the problem's operation rules.
   - The program also fails to handle cases where the array cannot be zeroed out due to the constraints of the problem's operation. For example, if the first element is non-zero, there is no way to reduce it to zero without affecting the subsequent elements in a way that doesn't allow the entire array to be zeroed out.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not correctly simulate the described operations and does not handle all cases properly.

**Correctness: False**
