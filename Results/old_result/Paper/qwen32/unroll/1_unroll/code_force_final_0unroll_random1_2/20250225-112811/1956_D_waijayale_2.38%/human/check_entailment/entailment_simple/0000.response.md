### Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be attempting to solve the problem by recursively maximizing the sum of subarrays using the MEX operation. However, there are several issues with the code that need to be addressed to ensure correctness:

1. **Undefined Variables:**
   - In `func_3()`, the list `a` is passed to `func_2(a)`, but `func_2` does not correctly call `recursive_maximize_sum` with the necessary parameters. Specifically, `recursive_maximize_sum` requires the list `a` and the list `ops` to be passed, but these are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray. Instead, it uses the value `r - l + 1` to replace elements in the subarray `a[l:r+1]`. This is not the correct approach to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Maximizing Sum:**
   - The logic for maximizing the sum is flawed. The program does not ensure that the MEX operation is applied optimally to maximize the sum. The condition `if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1))` is not a correct criterion for applying the MEX operation.

4. **Global State Issues:**
   - The list `ops` is used to store the operations, but it is not defined within `recursive_maximize_sum`. This will lead to a `NameError` when trying to append to `ops`.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is not correct. Therefore, the correct response is:

**Correctness: False**

To correct the program, one would need to properly define and pass the list `a` and `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum`, correctly calculate the MEX of subarrays, and apply the MEX operation to maximize the sum of the array.
