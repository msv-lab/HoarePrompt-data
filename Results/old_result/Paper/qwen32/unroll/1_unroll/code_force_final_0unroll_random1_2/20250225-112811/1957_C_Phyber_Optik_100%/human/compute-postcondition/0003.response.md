To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `dp` array. The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = n`, calculating each `dp[i]` based on the previous values `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` with the formula:

\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007 \]

Given the initial conditions:
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`

The loop will compute `dp[3]` through `dp[n]` using the above formula. The state of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and the moves `r_i` and `c_i` are not affected by the loop and will remain unchanged. The only variables that will change are the elements of the `dp` array from `dp[3]` to `dp[n]`.

After the loop finishes, the output state will be described by the values of `dp[1]` through `dp[n]`. However, since the problem asks for a concise description of the output state, we can summarize it by stating that `dp[i]` for `i` from `3` to `n` will have been computed according to the given formula.

Output State: **The values of `dp[i]` for `i` from `3` to `n` are computed using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, with `dp[1]` remaining `1` and `dp[2]` remaining `3`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and the moves `r_i` and `c_i`) remain unchanged.**
