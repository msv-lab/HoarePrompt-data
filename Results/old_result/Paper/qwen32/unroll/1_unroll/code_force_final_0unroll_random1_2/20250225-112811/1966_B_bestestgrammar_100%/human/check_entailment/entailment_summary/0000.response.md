### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using the specified operations. The logic is based on the observation that if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have different colors, then it might be impossible to make the entire grid the same color unless there is a possibility to propagate the color from one corner to the other through adjacent cells of the same color in either the top/bottom row or the first/last column.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have the same color.
2. **If Different Colors**:
   - It then checks if there exists at least one pair of adjacent cells in the top row (`gr[0][j]` and `gr[0][j+1]`) or the bottom row (`gr[n-1][j]` and `gr[n-1][j+1]`) that have different colors. If such a pair exists, it implies that we can change the color of the entire row and potentially propagate the change.
   - Similarly, it checks if there exists at least one pair of adjacent cells in the first column (`gr[i][0]` and `gr[i+1][0]`) or the last column (`gr[i][m-1]` and `gr[i+1][m-1]`) that have different colors. If such a pair exists, it implies that we can change the color of the entire column and potentially propagate the change.
3. **Conclusion**:
   - If neither the top row nor the bottom row has a pair of adjacent cells with different colors and neither the first column nor the last column has a pair of adjacent cells with different colors, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color, and the program outputs 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.

### Evaluation:

The program correctly captures the logic described above. It efficiently checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color. The solution is optimal given the constraints and correctly handles all edge cases, such as grids where all cells are already the same color, grids with only one row or column, and grids where the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors but there are adjacent cells with different colors in the same row or column.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
