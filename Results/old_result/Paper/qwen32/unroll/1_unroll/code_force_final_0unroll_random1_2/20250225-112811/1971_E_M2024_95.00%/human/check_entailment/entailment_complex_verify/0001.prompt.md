You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

    #State: The output state consists of the results of q queries for each of the t test cases. For each query d, the output is either the value b[s] if d matches an element a[s] in list a, or the calculated interpolated value m based on the differences in lists a and b. The final output for each test case is a line of space-separated results for each query, followed by a newline character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two sorted lists `a` and `b`, and a series of queries. For each query, it determines the corresponding value from list `b` either directly if the query matches an element in list `a`, or by linear interpolation based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`. The results of all queries for a test case are printed on a single line, separated by spaces.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to handle multiple test cases where a car travels from point 0 to point n on a number line, passing through k+1 known points (including 0 and n) at specific times. The program calculates the travel time for q queries, where each query asks for the time it takes to reach a specific point d on the number line.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the final destination), `k` (the number of known points), and `q` (the number of queries).
   - It then reads the list of known points `a` and the corresponding times `b` at which the car reaches these points. The lists `a` and `b` are augmented with a 0 at the beginning to simplify calculations.

2. **Distance and Time Differences:**
   - The program calculates the distances between consecutive known points (`ad` list) and the time differences between the corresponding arrival times (`bd` list).

3. **Speed Calculation:**
   - For each segment between two known points, the program calculates the speed `v` as the distance divided by the time.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in which the queried point `d` lies.
   - If `d` matches one of the known points, the program directly outputs the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the exact time to reach `d` based on the speed of the segment it lies in, adding the time already elapsed up to the start of the segment.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Handling of Known Points:** The program correctly identifies when a query point matches a known point and outputs the corresponding time.
- **Binary Search:** The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the relevant segment for each query.
- **Speed Calculation:** The speed for each segment is accurately calculated as the distance divided by the time.
- **Time Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the time to reach a point within a segment by using the speed of that segment and adding the time already elapsed up to the start of the segment.
- **Output Formatting:** The program outputs the results in the correct format, with each test case's results on a new line and each query's result separated by spaces.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
