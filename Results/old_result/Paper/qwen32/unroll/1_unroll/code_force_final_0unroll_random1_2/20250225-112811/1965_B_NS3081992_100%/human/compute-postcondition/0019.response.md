The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `lk`, and `l`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to ensure the loop executes. For the loop to execute, `l` must be greater than `lk`. The value of `ans` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`, `lk` is 0, `l` must be greater than `lk`**
