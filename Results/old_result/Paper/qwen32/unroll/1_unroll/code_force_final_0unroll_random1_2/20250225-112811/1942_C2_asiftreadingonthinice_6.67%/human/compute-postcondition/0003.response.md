Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The function returns a value based on the given constraints and logic for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, if the conditions are met, it returns a result indicating a certain property or value related to the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
