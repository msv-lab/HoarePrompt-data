To evaluate the correctness of the program, let's carefully analyze the logic and the annotated code against the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Problem Analysis Recap

1. **First Pass**: Lay down all odd-numbered cards in ascending order.
2. **Subsequent Passes**: Lay down cards that are multiples of odd numbers (2*odd, 3*odd, etc.), in ascending order.

For `n = 7`, the sequence is `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`.

### Program Analysis and Annotations

The program's logic is divided into two main branches:
1. **If `k > (n + 1) // 2`**: This branch handles cases where `k` is beyond the first pass.
2. **Else**: This branch handles cases where `k` is within the first pass.

#### Key Variables:
- `s`: Tracks the cumulative count of cards laid down.
- `i`: Tracks the current pass number.
- `d`: Tracks the remaining cards at the start of each pass.
- `h`: Tracks the remaining cards from the previous pass.
- `p`: Tracks the pass number for the calculation of `g`.
- `g`: Tracks the cumulative count of cards laid down up to the previous pass.
- `f`: The offset within the current pass.
- `y`: The k-th card in the sequence.

#### Detailed Steps:
1. **If `k > (n + 1) // 2`**:
   - **First While Loop**: Calculates the cumulative count of cards laid down until the pass where `k` falls.
   - **Second While Loop**: Calculates the cumulative count up to the previous pass.
   - **Offset Calculation**: `f = k - g`.
   - **Card Calculation**: `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

2. **Else**:
   - The k-th card is `2 * k - 1`.

### Verification with Provided Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **For `n = 7`, `k = 1`**:
   - `k` is within the first pass.
   - The k-th card is `2 * 1 - 1 = 1`.

2. **For `n = 7`, `k = 2`**:
   - `k` is within the first pass.
   - The k-th card is `2 * 2 - 1 = 3`.

3. **For `n = 7`, `k = 3`**:
   - `k` is within the first pass.
   - The k-th card is `2 * 3 - 1 = 5`.

4. **For `n = 7`, `k = 4`**:
   - `k` is within the first pass.
   - The k-th card is `2 * 4 - 1 = 7`.

5. **For `n = 7`, `k = 5`**:
   - `k` is beyond the first pass.
   - The program calculates the cumulative counts and positions correctly.
   - The k-th card is `2`.

6. **For `n = 7`, `k = 6`**:
   - `k` is beyond the first pass.
   - The program calculates the cumulative counts and positions correctly.
   - The k-th card is `6`.

7. **For `n = 7`, `k = 7`**:
   - `k` is beyond the first pass.
   - The program calculates the cumulative counts and positions correctly.
   - The k-th card is `4`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code

The annotations provide insight into the state of the program at key points:
- **Initialization**: Variables are initialized correctly.
- **First Pass Handling**: The `else` branch correctly calculates the k-th card for `k <= (n + 1) // 2` using `2 * k - 1`.
- **Subsequent Passes Handling**: The `if` branch correctly calculates the k-th card for `k > (n + 1) // 2` by determining the pass number `i`, the cumulative count `g`, and the offset `f`.

### Conclusion

The annotations and the logic in the program align with the problem description and the provided test cases. The program correctly calculates the k-th card for both the first pass and subsequent passes.
