Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR is zero.
- Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.
- Numbers in the sequence are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Eve removes one number at a time until the sequence is empty.
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Bitwise XOR Analysis:
- XOR of a number with itself is 0.
- XOR of 1 and 3 is 2.
- XOR of 2 and 4 is 6, but since we are dealing with numbers up to 4, the XOR of 2 and 4 is effectively 0 (considering only the lower 3 bits).
- XOR of 1 and 2 is 3.
- XOR of 1 and 4 is 5, but again, considering only the lower 3 bits, it is 1.
- XOR of 3 and 4 is 7, but considering only the lower 3 bits, it is 3.

### Key Insight:
- Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. This happens when the count of numbers contributing odd values to the XOR is even.
- Numbers 1 and 3 contribute odd values to the XOR, while 2 and 4 contribute even values (since 2 and 4 are powers of 2 and do not contribute to the lower 2 bits in XOR with themselves).

### Optimal Strategy:
- Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the count of numbers contributing odd values (1 and 3) remains even as long as possible.
- If the count of 1s and 3s is odd, Bob can win once before Alice wins.
- After each game, the total number of numbers reduces by one, and Eve can adjust her strategy accordingly.

### Program Analysis:
The program given is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- The program reads the input for each test case.
- It processes the first three elements of `p` to check if all are odd (which is not relevant to the problem as we need to consider all elements).
- It then calculates `sum(p) // 2` which is the total number of games played (since one number is removed per game).
- The logic `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the first three elements are odd, which is not the correct approach to determine Bob's wins.

### Correct Approach:
- Count the number of 1s and 3s.
- If the count of 1s and 3s is odd, Bob can win once initially.
- The rest of the games are determined by the total number of games played, which is `sum(p) // 2`.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = p[0] + p[2]  # Count of 1s and 3s
        bob_wins = odd_count % 2 + sum(p) // 2
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
