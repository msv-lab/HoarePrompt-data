Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array after adding a permutation to it. Let's break down the logic and functions used in the program to see if they correctly implement the solution.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` is used to read the number of test cases and the size of the array for each test case. This function is correctly implemented to read an integer from the input.
   - `func_3()` is used to read the array elements for each test case. This function reads a line of input, splits it into space-separated components, converts each component to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This is correctly implemented.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program sorts the array and removes duplicates using `sorted(list(set(func_3())))`. This step ensures that we are only considering unique elements in the array, which is necessary for the subsequent logic.
   - The maximum value in the array is found using `max(arr)`, but this is not used anywhere in the program, so it seems unnecessary.
   - The program then iterates over each unique element in the sorted array. For each element, it uses `bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)` to find the position where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array. This is used to determine how many elements in the array can be made equal to `arr[i] + k` for some permutation `k`.
   - The difference `a - i` gives the number of elements that can be made equal to `arr[i] + k` for some permutation `k`. The program keeps track of the maximum such value across all elements.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum value of `ans` for each test case, which is the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.

The logic of the program is correct based on the problem description. The use of `bisect_left` and the calculation of the difference `a - i` correctly determine the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.

Given the functions and the logic of the program, it appears that the program is correctly solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
