In the given code snippet, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable whose value is not used in the loop body.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The loop will execute based on the value obtained from `int(input())`. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we only need to ensure that the input value is such that the loop can execute.

To ensure that the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1. This input value corresponds to the number of test cases (`t`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is at least 1, which means `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4** (This part does not need adjustment as it already ensures the loop can execute at least once. However, to strictly adhere to the requirement of adjusting only the objects in the loop head, we focus on the input value directly.)

Since the loop head only involves the input value which is `t`, and `t` is already given to be at least 1, there's no specific adjustment needed for the loop to execute at least once. But to strictly follow the instruction, we can state:

State: **The input value `t` must be at least 1**.
