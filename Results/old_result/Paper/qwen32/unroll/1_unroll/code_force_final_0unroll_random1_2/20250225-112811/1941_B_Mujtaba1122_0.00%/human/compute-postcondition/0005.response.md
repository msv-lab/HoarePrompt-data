The `print('NO')` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward. It does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the conditions and transformations applied to a list and the behavior of a function `func_1(list, n)`, which returns `False`. However, none of these details affect the `print('NO')` statement.
2. The `print('NO')` statement is a direct output of the string `'NO'` and does not involve any calculations, variables, or conditions from the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
