The code snippet initializes an empty list named `resultats`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `cas_de_test`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in each test case; `resultats` is an empty list.**
