To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, n):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `n-1`.

Let's break down the variables involved:
- `i`: This is the loop variable that will take values from 0 to `n-1`.
- `n`: This is the upper limit of the range, which is the length of the string `s`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `A` is an empty list.
- `idx_A` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The variables `A` and `idx_A` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, `i` is initialized implicitly by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust it directly before the loop starts.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list**
