You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query in the test cases. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` are not preserved after the loop execution and revert to their initial or undefined states outside the loop, except for the printed results of the queries.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific condition is met within the sublist defined by the query and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires determining if a subarray of an array `c` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if there exists an array `b` such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
2. For every index `i` in the subarray, `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
3. Every element in `b` is greater than 0.

The program provided follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array `c`), `q` (number of queries), and the array `c` itself.
3. It initializes two prefix sum arrays: `p` for the sum of elements and `c` for the count of 1s in the subarrays.
4. It iterates through the array `c` to fill the prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`.
5. For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray and the count of 1s in the subarray using the prefix sum arrays.
6. It then checks if the subarray can be considered "good" based on:
   - The length of the subarray is greater than 1.
   - The sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray.
7. If the conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic behind the check (`s - (b - a + 1) >= i`) is:
- `s` is the sum of the subarray.
- `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray.
- `i` is the count of 1s in the subarray.
- The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that there are enough elements in the subarray that are not equal to 1 to form a new array `b` where each element is greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in the subarray `c`.

This logic is based on the fact that we can subtract 1 from each element in the subarray (except the 1s) to form a new array `b` where each element is greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in the subarray `c`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
