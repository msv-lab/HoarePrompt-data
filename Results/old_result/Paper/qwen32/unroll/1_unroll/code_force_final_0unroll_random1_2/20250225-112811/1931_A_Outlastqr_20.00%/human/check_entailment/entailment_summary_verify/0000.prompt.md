You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78). It then prints a string based on the value of `n`: if `n > 52`, it prints a string in the format `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`; if `26 < n <= 52`, it prints a string in the format `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`; if `n <= 26`, it prints a string in the format `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to determine the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded as a sum of the positions of its characters in the alphabet.
- The input is an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.
- The output should be the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program uses the following logic:
- For `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- For `52 ≥ n > 26`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- For `n ≤ 26`, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Checking the Logic
Let's verify if this logic covers all potential cases correctly.

1. **Case 1: n > 52**
   - The formula `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` is used.
   - This means the first letter is determined by `n - 53`, and the last two letters are 'z'.
   - For `n = 53`, the word would be `'a' + 'zz' = 'azz'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 78`, the word would be `'z' + 'zz' = 'zzz'`, which is correct.

2. **Case 2: 52 ≥ n > 26**
   - The formula `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` is used.
   - This means the first letter is 'a', the second letter is determined by `n - 28`, and the last letter is 'z'.
   - For `n = 27`, the word would be `'a' + 'a' + 'z' = 'aaz'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 52`, the word would be `'a' + 'z' + 'z' = 'azz'`, which is correct.

3. **Case 3: n ≤ 26**
   - The formula `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` is used.
   - This means the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is determined by `n - 3`.
   - For `n = 3`, the word would be `'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 26`, the word would be `'aa' + 'z' = 'aaz'`, which is correct.

### Testing Edge Cases
Let's test some edge cases to ensure the program works correctly:
- **n = 3**: `'aaa'` (correct)
- **n = 26**: `'aaz'` (correct)
- **n = 27**: `'aaz'` (correct, but should be `'aay'` as 'aaz' is not lexicographically smallest for `n=27`)
- **n = 52**: `'azz'` (correct, but should be `'ayz'` as 'azz' is not lexicographically smallest for `n=52`)
- **n = 53**: `'azz'` (correct)
- **n = 78**: `'zzz'` (correct)

### Conclusion
The program does not handle some cases correctly. For example:
- For `n = 27`, the correct output should be `'aay'` instead of `'aaz'`.
- For `n = 52`, the correct output should be `'ayz'` instead of `'azz'`.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation
The program fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain values of `n`, particularly when `n` is such that the constructed word is not the smallest possible.
