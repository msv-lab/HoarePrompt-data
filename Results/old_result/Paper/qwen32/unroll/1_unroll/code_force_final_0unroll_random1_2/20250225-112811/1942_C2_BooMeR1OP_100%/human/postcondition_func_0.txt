The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, a constraint `y`, and a list of `x` distinct chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the gaps between the chosen vertices and the constraint `y`.
