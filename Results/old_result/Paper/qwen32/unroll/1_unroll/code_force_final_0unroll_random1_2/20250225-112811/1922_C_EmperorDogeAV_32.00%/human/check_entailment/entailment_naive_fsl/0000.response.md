Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`:** The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum cost to reach the closest city for each city. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function does not correctly determine the closest city for each city. Specifically, the logic for determining the closest city does not consider the unique closest city condition properly. The function should return the cost to travel to the closest city, not just `1` if the closest city is the next one.

2. **Incorrect Use of Prefixed Sums:** The prefixed sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are calculated based on the incorrect values returned by `func_1`. This means that the final cost calculations for the queries will be incorrect.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the cities are very close to each other or when the cities are spread out in such a way that the closest city is not always the next one.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
5
1 5
5 1
2 4
4 2
3 1
```

Expected Output:
```
4
4
2
2
2
```

However, the provided program will likely give incorrect results for this input because the `func_1` function does not correctly determine the closest city for each city.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function and the main logic:

```python
def find_closest_cities(cities, n):
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest_cities[i] = 1
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest_cities[i] = n - 2
        else:
            left_dist = cities[i] - cities[i - 1]
            right_dist = cities[i + 1] - cities[i]
            if left_dist < right_dist:
                closest_cities[i] = i - 1
            else:
                closest_cities[i] = i + 1
    return closest_cities

def calculate_cost_to_closest(cities, closest_cities, n):
    cost_to_closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        cost_to_closest[i] = abs(cities[closest_cities[i]] - cities[i])
    return cost_to_closest

def calculate_prefix_sums(cost_to_closest, n):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + cost_to_closest[i]
    return prefix_sum

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    closest_cities = find_closest_cities(cities, n)
    cost_to_closest = calculate_cost_to_closest(cities, closest_cities, n)
    prefix_sum_f = calculate_prefix_sums(cost_to_closest, n)
    cities.reverse()
    closest_cities.reverse()
    cost_to_closest.reverse()
    prefix_sum_b = calculate_prefix_sums(cost_to_closest, n)
    prefix_sum_b.reverse()
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b:
            print(prefix_sum_f[b - 1] - prefix_sum_f[a - 1])
        else:
            print(prefix_sum_b[b - 1] - prefix_sum_b[a - 1])
```

This corrected version ensures that the closest city is determined correctly and the prefixed sums are calculated based on the correct costs.
