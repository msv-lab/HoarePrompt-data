You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: the printed scores for each test case, one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a set of 2n integers. For each test case, it calculates a score by summing up the smallest n integers from the set and prints this score.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sorting the List**: The list of numbers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we iterate through the list in steps of 2, we are always picking the smallest available numbers first.

2. **Iterating and Summing**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first number of each pair to the score. Since the list is sorted, the first number of each pair is always the smaller one, which is the optimal choice to maximize the score.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by wrapping the logic in a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

The program works correctly for all the provided examples and handles the constraints specified in the problem description. There is no apparent case where the program would not produce the correct maximum score based on the described strategy.
