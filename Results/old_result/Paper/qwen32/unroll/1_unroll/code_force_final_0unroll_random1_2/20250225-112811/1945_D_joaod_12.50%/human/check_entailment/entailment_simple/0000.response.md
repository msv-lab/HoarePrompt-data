### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to help Kirill minimize the number of coins he has to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The provided solution iterates through the queue from the end to the beginning, calculating the minimum cost required to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` spots.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution and its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `na_frente` is the number of people in front of Kirill (n), and `pos_final` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m).
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` is the list of costs to directly swap with a person (a_i).
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` is the list of costs to pass through a person (b_i).
   - `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by 1 to convert them to zero-based indexing.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - `total` keeps track of the cumulative cost Kirill has incurred so far.
   - `best` is initialized to a very large number (10^12) and is used to store the minimum cost to be within the first `m` positions.
   - The loop iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning.
     - If the current position `v` is within the first `m` positions (`v <= pos_final`):
       - The code checks if the cost to swap with the person at position `v` plus the total cost so far is less than the current best cost. If it is, it updates `best`.
       - It then adds the minimum of the swap cost (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) and the pass-through cost (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) to `total`.
     - If the current position `v` is not within the first `m` positions:
       - It adds the minimum of the swap cost and the pass-through cost to `total`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the minimum cost stored in `best` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:

The solution correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue. It efficiently iterates through the queue and keeps track of the cumulative cost while updating the best cost whenever a better option is found. The use of `best` ensures that the minimum cost is always stored and printed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the given test cases.

**Correctness: True**
