### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided code. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Program Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
   - `count` is initialized to 2 (representing `b`).
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` (since every pair \((a, 1)\) is valid because \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1).

2. **Loop over `b` (denoted as `count`)**:
   - The loop runs while `count` (representing `b`) is less than or equal to `m`.
   - `countmins` is calculated as `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n // count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
   - `ans` is incremented by `g // count + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the final value of `ans` is printed.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The program incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- It does not directly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair.
- The logic for updating `ans` is based on an incorrect assumption about the relationship between `a`, `b`, and their gcd.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

This approach ensures that we correctly count all pairs that satisfy the given condition. However, this approach is computationally expensive for large `n` and `m`.

Given the problem constraints, a more efficient approach would involve leveraging mathematical properties and optimizations. However, the provided program does not implement any such optimizations or correct logic.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
