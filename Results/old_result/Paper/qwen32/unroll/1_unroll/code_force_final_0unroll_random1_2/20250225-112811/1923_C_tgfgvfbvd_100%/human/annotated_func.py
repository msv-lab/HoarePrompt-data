#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

                print('NO')
        
    #State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query in the test cases. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` are not preserved after the loop execution and revert to their initial or undefined states outside the loop, except for the printed results of the queries.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific condition is met within the sublist defined by the query and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
