You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code aims to solve the problem of finding a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, but for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Handling of `k = 1`**:
   - When `k = 1`, the code handles the special case where `n = 2` separately.
   - For `n > 2`, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - This seems correct for `k = 1` as it ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, but all other sums are achievable.

2. **Handling of `k > 1`**:
   - The code constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - While this approach tries to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`, it does not guarantee that all sums `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k` can be achieved.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Subsequence Sum Property**:
   - The code does not explicitly ensure that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
   - For example, consider the case `n = 10` and `k = 7`. The sequence generated might not cover all sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where `k` is close to `n` or when `n` is a power of 2.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 9`, the sequence might not cover all sums from 1 to 8.

3. **General Construction**:
   - The construction of the sequence is based on powers of 2 and specific values, but it does not guarantee that all required sums can be achieved.
   - There might be gaps in the sums that can be achieved with the constructed sequence.

### Example of Failure:

Let's consider the input `n = 10` and `k = 7`:
- The code might generate a sequence like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16]`.
- However, it is not guaranteed that all sums from 1 to 10 except 7 can be achieved with this sequence.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the code does not guarantee that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`. Therefore, the code is incorrect for at least some cases.

Correctness: **False**.
