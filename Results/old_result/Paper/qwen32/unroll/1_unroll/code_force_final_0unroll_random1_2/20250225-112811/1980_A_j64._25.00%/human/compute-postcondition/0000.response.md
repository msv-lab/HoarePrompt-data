The provided code snippet is a function definition without any execution. To determine the output state, we need the actual implementation of the function that processes the `t` and `test_cases` as described in the docstring. However, based on the given code snippet and the initial state, no changes are made to the variables `t` and `test_cases` because no operations are performed on them within the snippet. 

Since the function is not executed and no changes occur to the initial state variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
