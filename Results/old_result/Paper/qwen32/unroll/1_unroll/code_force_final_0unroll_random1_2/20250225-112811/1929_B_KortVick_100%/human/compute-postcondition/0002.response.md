To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the given code:

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and then checks if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`. Depending on the result of this check, it prints either `k // 2 + 1` or `ceil(k / 2)`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the only output is what is printed, the output state can be described as the sequence of printed values for each test case. However, since we don't have specific values for `t`, `n`, and `k`, we can only describe the process and the format of the output.

The output state after all the executions of the loop will be a series of printed numbers, one for each test case.

Output State: **A series of printed numbers, one for each test case, where each number is either `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise.**
