You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is given at the beginning of the input.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: After executing all iterations, the variables `itest`, `n`, and `a` will have the values from the last test case processed by the loop. The variable `ntest` will remain unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array based on the problem description.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The optimal way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order and then consider the difference between the largest and smallest elements, as this would be the maximum single difference that can contribute to the beauty.

However, the beauty calculation involves the sum of all consecutive differences, not just the single largest difference. The correct approach is to maximize each individual difference, which is achieved by arranging the array in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. The maximum beauty would then be the sum of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in this sorted order.

The provided program sorts the array and then only calculates the difference between the last and the first element (a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]), which does not account for the sum of all consecutive differences. This is incorrect because it does not consider the contributions of all intermediate differences.

For example, in the third test case of the problem statement (with the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]), the correct approach would be to sort the array to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] and then calculate the beauty as (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57. However, the provided program would only calculate 100 - 43 = 57, which is not the correct sum of all differences.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
