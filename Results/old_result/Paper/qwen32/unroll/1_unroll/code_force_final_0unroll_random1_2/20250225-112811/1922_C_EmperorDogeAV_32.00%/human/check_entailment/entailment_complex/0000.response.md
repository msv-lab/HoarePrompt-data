### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities under specific conditions. Let's break down the program and the function `func_1` to understand if it correctly implements the solution.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It also reads the queries, which consist of pairs of city indices.

2. **Determination of Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine for each city (except the first and last) whether the next city is closer or if the difference in coordinates to the next city should be recorded.
   - The function iterates through the list of cities and for each city (except the first and last), it compares the distance to the next city (`forward`) with the distance to the previous city (`back`).
   - If the next city is closer, it records `1` in `prog_cities` for that city; otherwise, it records the distance to the next city.
   - However, there is an issue with the implementation of `func_1`. The function is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it only checks the next city and does not correctly handle the closest city for each city in both forward and backward directions.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions based on the results from `func_1`.
   - The prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total number of coins required to travel from one city to another using the closest cities.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) and uses the appropriate prefix sum to calculate the minimum number of coins required.

### Issues in the Implementation:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly determine the closest city for each city. It only checks the next city and does not handle the closest city in both forward and backward directions properly.
- The function should determine the closest city for each city by comparing distances to both the next and previous cities and recording the closest city accordingly.
- The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect results from `func_1`, leading to incorrect results for the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the implementation of `func_1`, the program does not correctly determine the closest city for each city and, consequently, does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities.

**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the function `func_1`, which does not correctly determine the closest city for each city.
