To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `x * x <= n`. Given that `x` is initially set to 1, the condition simplifies to `1 * 1 <= n`, or simply `1 <= n`. This means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The variable `m` is not part of the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variables `x` and `cnt` are also not part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted either.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0**
