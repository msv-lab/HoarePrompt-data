In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is intentionally unused. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the loop can execute. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the range is determined by `t`. Since `t` is already provided and is guaranteed to be within the specified range (1 <= t <= 10^4), no adjustment is needed for `_`. The loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state does not need any modification for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
