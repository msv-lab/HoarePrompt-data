In the given for loop, the only variable that appears in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute if the range `(3, n + 1)` is non-empty, which means that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `dp`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given this, the state before the loop starts must ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute. The values of `t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `dp` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, only its body.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; `dp[1]` is 1; `dp[2]` is 3;**
