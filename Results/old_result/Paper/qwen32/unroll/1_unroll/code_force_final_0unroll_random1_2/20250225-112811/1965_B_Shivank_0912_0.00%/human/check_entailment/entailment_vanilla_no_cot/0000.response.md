Correctness: **False**

The provided program constructs a sequence of powers of 2 for each test case, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. This approach does not guarantee that there is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to `k`, nor does it ensure that for all `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`), there is a subsequence that sums to `v`.

To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to construct a sequence that meets the given conditions for each test case. Here's a correct approach:

1. Start with the smallest possible numbers.
2. Ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
3. Ensure that all other sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by subsequences.

A known solution to this problem is to use a sequence based on the binary representation of numbers, with some adjustments to avoid the sum `k`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
cases = []
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    cases.append((n, k))
    index += 2

def construct_sequence(n, k):
    sequence = []
    current_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if (current_sum + i == k):
            continue
        current_sum += i
        sequence.append(i)
        if current_sum >= n:
            break
    return sequence

results = []
for (n, k) in cases:
    sequence = construct_sequence(n, k)
    results.append((len(sequence), sequence))

for result in results:
    print(result[0])
    print(' '.join(map(str, result[1])))
```

This program constructs a sequence by iteratively adding the smallest possible numbers, skipping any number that would make the current sum equal to `k`. This ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
