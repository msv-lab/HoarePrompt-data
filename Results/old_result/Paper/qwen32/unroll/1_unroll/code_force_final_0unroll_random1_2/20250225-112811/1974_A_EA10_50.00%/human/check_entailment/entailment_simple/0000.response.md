Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
To solve the problem, we need to place the 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on the minimum number of 5x3 grids (screens). Each 5x3 grid can hold up to 15 1x1 icons or up to 5 2x2 icons (if they are placed optimally).

### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons Placement:** Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. If we have `y` 2x2 icons, we need to determine how many screens are required to place them. Since each screen can fit at most 5 2x2 icons (15 cells / 4 cells per 2x2 icon ≈ 3.75, so max 3 full 2x2 icons + 1 partial ≈ 5), we can use the formula `(y + 1) // 2` to determine the minimum number of screens required for 2x2 icons. This formula ensures that any leftover 2x2 icons that don't completely fill a screen still get their own screen.

2. **1x1 Icons Placement:** After placing the 2x2 icons, we need to place the remaining 1x1 icons. Each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons. We calculate the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons and place the 1x1 icons in the remaining space. If there is not enough space, we need additional screens.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the formula `(y + 1) // 2` to calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. This is correct.

However, the logic for placing the 1x1 icons seems incorrect. The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, which represents the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. The program then checks if `m < a` (where `a` is the number of test cases, not the remaining space), which doesn't make sense in this context. Instead, it should check if the remaining space `m` is less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`.

The correct logic should be:
- Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons: `z = (y + 1) // 2`
- Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons: `m = 15 * z - y * 4`
- Calculate the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons: `additional_screens = (x - m + 14) // 15` (using 14 instead of 15 to ensure rounding up correctly)
- The total number of screens required is `z + additional_screens`

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        additional_screens = (x - m + 14) // 15 if m < x else 0
        
        print(z + additional_screens)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
