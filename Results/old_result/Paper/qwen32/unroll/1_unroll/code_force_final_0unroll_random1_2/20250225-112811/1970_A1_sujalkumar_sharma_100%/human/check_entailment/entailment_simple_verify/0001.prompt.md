You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; n is the length of s; prefix_balance is a list of tuples (balance_before, index, character) for each character in s; balance is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` which is a balanced parentheses sequence formed by joining the characters from `prefix_balance` in the specified order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's walk through the program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a single line of input which is stored in the variable `s`. This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Calculating Prefix Balances:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples containing the prefix balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
   - It also initializes a variable `balance` to keep track of the running balance of the parentheses sequence.
   - As it iterates over each character in the input string `s`, it appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to the `prefix_balance` list. Here, `balance` is the balance before the current character, `i` is the position of the character, and `s[i]` is the character itself.
   - Depending on whether the current character is an opening parenthesis `(` or a closing parenthesis `)`, the balance is incremented or decremented, respectively.

3. **Sorting the Prefix Balances:**
   - The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a custom sorting key. The key is a tuple `(x[0], -x[1])`, which means that the list is primarily sorted by the prefix balance in ascending order, and secondarily by the position in descending order (to break ties).

4. **Generating the Result:**
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.
   - It uses a list comprehension `[x[2] for x in prefix_balance]` to extract the characters from the sorted list of tuples, and then joins them into a single string using `''.join()`.

5. **Output:**
   - The resulting string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence, is returned by the function `func_1` and printed.

### Verification Against Problem Statement

- **Prefix Balance Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
- **Sorting Logic:** The sorting logic matches the problem statement's requirement of sorting by prefix balance in ascending order and by position in descending order to break ties.
- **Result Construction:** The program correctly constructs the result string by extracting and joining the characters from the sorted list of tuples.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
