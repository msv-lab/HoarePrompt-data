The given initial state provides information about several variables (`visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok`) and their roles in the program. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the program will be:

Output: **YES**
