In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use inside the loop. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1 because the range function will not generate any values if `t` is 0, and thus the loop will not execute.

The other variables `n` and the strings of '<' and '>' characters are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted according to the task requirements. They will be defined and used inside the loop body, which is omitted in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure that it is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
