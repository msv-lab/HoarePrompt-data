Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. The integer `t` satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and the list `b` contains `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
