The code snippet initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n - 1` zeros. This means that for each test case, a new list `prog_cities` is created with a length equal to the number of cities minus one, and all elements are set to zero.

Given the initial state, the variable `n` is the number of cities in the current test case, and it is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The list `cities` contains the coordinates of the cities and the queries, but these are not affected by the current line of code.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.**
