Let's analyze the program code and the annotated version to systematically evaluate whether the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign i occurs every a_i years and must occur sequentially. The first sign occurs in the first possible year that is a multiple of a_1, the second sign occurs in the first possible year after the first sign that is a multiple of a_2, and so on.

### Code Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each with a number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`. For each test case, it calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence as follows:
1. Start at `current_year = 0`.
2. For each periodicity `ai` in the list:
   - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`.
3. Update `current_year` to this next year.
4. After processing all signs, append the final `current_year` to the results list.

### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call, correctly indicating that `t` is the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the number of signs and their periodicities, and `results` is a list of the final years for each test case.

### Evaluation
The logic in the program is correct and matches the problem description:
- It correctly calculates the next occurrence year for each sign based on the current year.
- It ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, starting from the year after the previous sign's occurrence.
- The program handles the given examples correctly.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The annotations support this conclusion by correctly describing the state of the program at key points.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
