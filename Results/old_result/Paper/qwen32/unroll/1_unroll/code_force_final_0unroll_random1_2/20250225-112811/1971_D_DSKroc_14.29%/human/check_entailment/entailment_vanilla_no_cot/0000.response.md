Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The logic is based on counting the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string, which indicates a necessary cut point. Adding one to this count gives the total number of pieces required. This approach works because each such transition represents a boundary where the string needs to be split to ensure that all '0's can be moved to the front and all '1's to the back.
