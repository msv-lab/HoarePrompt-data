In the provided for loop, the loop head contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a variable that is commonly used to indicate that the loop variable is intentionally unused. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is expected to be the number of test cases `t`.

Given the loop statement:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is the result of `int(input())`. This value determines how many times the loop will execute. Since the problem states that `t` (the number of test cases) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value within this range.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `int(input())` returns a value within the range [1, 5 ⋅ 10^4].

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and `int(input())` returns `t`**
