You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9.

    #State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query in the test cases. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` are not preserved after the loop execution and revert to their initial or undefined states outside the loop, except for the printed results of the queries.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" based on the problem description. Specifically, the logic for checking if a subarray can be transformed into another array \( b \) with the required properties is flawed.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Condition 1**: The sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) must equal the sum of the corresponding subarray \( b \).
2. **Condition 2**: Each element in \( a \) (which is the subarray of \( c \)) must not be equal to the corresponding element in \( b \).
3. **Condition 3**: Each element in \( b \) must be greater than 0.

The program attempts to check if the subarray can be transformed by calculating the sum of the subarray and counting the number of 1s in the subarray. However, it fails to ensure that each element in the subarray can be transformed into a different positive integer while maintaining the sum.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4
1 4
```

The subarray from index 1 to 4 is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The sum of this subarray is 10. The program checks if `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` where `s` is the sum of the subarray, `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray, and `i` is the count of 1s in the subarray. In this case, `s = 10`, `b - a + 1 = 4`, and `i = 1`. The condition `10 - 4 >= 1` is true, so the program outputs "YES".

However, it is impossible to transform `[1, 2, 3, 4]` into another array `[b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4]` such that:
- \( b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 10 \)
- \( b_i > 0 \) for all \( i \)
- \( b_i \neq c_i \) for all \( i \)

For example, if we change `b_1` from 1 to 2, we need to adjust the other elements to maintain the sum, but any adjustment will either violate the condition \( b_i \neq c_i \) or make some \( b_i \leq 0 \).

Therefore, the correct output for this input should be "NO", but the program outputs "YES". This demonstrates that the program is incorrect.
