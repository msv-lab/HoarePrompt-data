Reasoning:

The provided program logic is flawed. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required operations. Here's a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Order of Operations**: The function `func_1` first constructs a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. It then calculates the cumulative product modulo `m` in reverse order of `b`. However, the problem requires the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step before removing an element, not after rearranging the elements.

2. **Cumulative Product Calculation**: The function calculates the cumulative product modulo `m` in reverse order of `b`, which does not match the requirement of calculating the product before each removal according to the commands.

3. **Reversing the Result**: The function returns the cumulative products in reverse order, which is incorrect as per the problem statement. The output should be the cumulative products in the order they are calculated.

To correctly implement the solution, the program should:

- Calculate the product of all elements in the array `a` initially.
- For each command, output the current product modulo `m` and then update the product by removing the leftmost or rightmost element as specified by the command.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        ans.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
            r -= 1
    
    return ans

# Main function
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))
```

In this corrected version, `pow(a[l], m - 2, m)` is used to compute the modular multiplicative inverse, which allows for the removal of an element from the product modulo `m`.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
