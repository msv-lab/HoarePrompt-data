Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum cost to move to the closest city. However, it incorrectly calculates the cost for each city. The function only checks the immediate forward and backward cities, but it does not correctly handle the situation when the closest city is not the immediate neighbor. The function should correctly determine the closest city for each city and calculate the cost accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect values returned by `func_1`. Since `func_1` does not correctly determine the closest cities, the prefix sums are also incorrect.

3. **Handling of Queries:**
   - The program attempts to use the prefix sums to calculate the cost of traveling between cities. However, since the prefix sums are incorrect, the final results for the queries are also incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Determine the closest city for each city.
- Calculate the cost to move to the closest city correctly.
- Use the correct costs to calculate the prefix sums.
- Use the prefix sums to efficiently answer the queries.

The current implementation does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
