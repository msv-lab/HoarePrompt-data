### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its components to determine if the program meets the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to modify the array `a` within a specified range `[l, r]` by setting all its elements to `r - l + 1` if the current sum of elements in that range is less than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
   - It also records the operations performed in the `ops` list.
   - The function is recursive and processes the range from `l + 1` to `r` first before checking and potentially modifying the range `[l, r]`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the full range of the array.
   - It then returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function checks if the sum of the elements in the range `[l, r]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
   - If the condition is met, it uses `func_1` to set all elements in the range to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - If the condition is not met, it finds the maximum element in the range and recursively processes the subarrays on either side of the maximum element.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It also prints the operations in the required format.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the logic**:
  - The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that if the sum of a subarray is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum for that subarray (i.e., if all elements were set to `r - l + 1`), it sets all elements to `r - l + 1`.
  - If the sum is already greater than the maximum possible sum, it finds the maximum element and recursively processes the subarrays on either side of the maximum element.
  - This approach ensures that the sum of the array is maximized.

- **Output Format**:
  - The program correctly outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations.
  - It also outputs the operations in the required format, adjusting the indices to be 1-based.

- **Constraints**:
  - The problem specifies that the maximum number of operations is `5 * 10^5`. Given the constraints on `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18), the recursive approach will not exceed this limit.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array while adhering to the constraints and output requirements specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
