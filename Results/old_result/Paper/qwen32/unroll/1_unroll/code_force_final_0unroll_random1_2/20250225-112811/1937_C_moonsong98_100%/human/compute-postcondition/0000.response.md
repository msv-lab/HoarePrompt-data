The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the input, but it will still satisfy the condition that it is an integer within the range of 2 to 10,000 inclusive.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, as provided by the input.**
