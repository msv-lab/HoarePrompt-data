Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
    - The program initializes a `dp` array with a size of 300007 elements and calls `func_1(300000)` to precompute values. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, which will result in a `NameError`.
    - Even if `func_1` were defined correctly, the precomputation step is only done once for a fixed size of 300000, which might not be sufficient if the input `n` exceeds this size. The problem constraints specify that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, but individual `n` can be up to 3 * 10^5. Therefore, the precomputation should handle up to 3 * 10^5.

2. **Handling of Invalid Positions**:
    - The program uses a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, it adds both `r` and `c` to the set without distinguishing between them, which is incorrect. The program should keep track of rows and columns separately to correctly determine valid positions for placing rooks.

3. **Calculation of Final Configurations**:
    - The program uses the precomputed `dp` array to determine the number of possible final configurations. However, the formula used in `func_1` does not correctly represent the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a chessboard. The problem requires a different combinatorial approach to count the number of valid configurations after `k` moves.

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `n` is very small or when `k` is equal to `n`, which might result in no valid moves remaining.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the provided problem description. A correct solution would require a proper combinatorial approach to count the number of valid configurations, possibly using dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics, and correctly handling the constraints and edge cases.
