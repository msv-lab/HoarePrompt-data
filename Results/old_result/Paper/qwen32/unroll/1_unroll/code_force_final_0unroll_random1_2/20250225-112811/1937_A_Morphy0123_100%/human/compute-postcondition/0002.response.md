Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the output state consists of the printed results for each test case based on the provided logic. The variable `n_cases` remains unchanged, and for each test case, the program prints either 1 if `n` is 1, or the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` otherwise.**
