You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers for each test case. It then constructs and prints a list of integers based on specific rules involving the minimum unused non-negative integer and the absolute differences between the list elements and this minimum integer. The function outputs a space-separated list of integers for each test case, followed by an empty line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
Farmer John provides an array `a` of length `n`, and we need to construct a permutation `p` such that for each `i`, `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The MEX (minimum excludant) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation `p`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`.
   - It initializes `minn` to 0, which keeps track of the smallest unused number.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `used` to keep track of numbers that have been used in the permutation.

3. **Iterating Over the Array `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
       - It appends `minn` to the `mex` list (which is the current MEX).
       - It marks `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary.
       - It increments `minn` until it finds the next unused number.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
       - It calculates the number to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - It marks this number as used in the `used` dictionary.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation for each test case, it prints the permutation.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Handling `arr[i] > 0`**:
  - When `arr[i] > 0`, the program correctly identifies the current MEX (`minn`) and appends it to the permutation.
  - It then updates `minn` to the next unused number, ensuring that future MEX calculations are correct.

- **Handling `arr[i] <= 0`**:
  - When `arr[i] <= 0`, the program calculates the number to append as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
  - This calculation is based on the condition `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`, which means `p[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - a[i]`.
  - The program correctly identifies the number to append by taking the absolute difference and ensures it is not already used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `arr[i]` is positive or negative correctly.
  - It ensures that the permutation is valid by keeping track of used numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. It adheres to the problem constraints and correctly calculates the MEX for each step.
