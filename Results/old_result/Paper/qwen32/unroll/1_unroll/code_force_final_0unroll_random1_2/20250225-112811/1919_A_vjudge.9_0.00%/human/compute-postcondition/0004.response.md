In the given for loop, the loop iterates over the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The variables `a`, `b`, and `t` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head involves the variable `result` and the list `results`.
2. The loop will execute if `results` has at least one element.
3. The initial state of `a` and `b` does not affect the execution of the loop.
4. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and is related to the length of the `results` list, but it is not directly used in the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` has at least one element.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` for the corresponding test case, and `results` must have at least one element.**
