The function reads a number of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers, `n` and `k`. It then computes and prints a result based on the value of `k` relative to `4 * n - 2`: if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`.
