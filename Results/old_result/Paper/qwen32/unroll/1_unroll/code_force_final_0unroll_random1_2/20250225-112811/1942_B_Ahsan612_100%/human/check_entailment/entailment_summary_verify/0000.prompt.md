You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, then computes and prints a list `res` of `n` integers where each element `res[i]` is determined by subtracting the corresponding element `a[i]` from a variable `mex` initialized to `n`, updating `mex` to the minimum value encountered during the computation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in how the MEX (minimum excludant) is being handled and updated.

Here's why the code is incorrect:

The code currently calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and then updates `mex` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the `mex` is correctly maintained and that `res[i]` is a valid number that hasn't been used before in the permutation `p`.

To construct the correct permutation `p`, we need to ensure that each `p[i]` is the MEX of the already constructed part of `p` minus `a[i]`, and that `p[i]` is not already in the permutation. The current code does not check if `res[i]` has already been used in the permutation `p`.

Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the issue:

```
Input:
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2

Expected Output:
0 1 4 2 3

Actual Output:
5 4 7 5 3
```

In this example, the code incorrectly computes the permutation `p` as `[5, 4, 7, 5, 3]`, which is not valid because it includes numbers outside the range `[0, 4]` and contains duplicates.

To fix the code, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and correctly compute the MEX for each position in the permutation `p`.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each `res[i]` is correctly computed and that it is not already used in the permutation `p`. The set `used` keeps track of the numbers that have already been used in the permutation, and `mex` is updated to the smallest unused number.
