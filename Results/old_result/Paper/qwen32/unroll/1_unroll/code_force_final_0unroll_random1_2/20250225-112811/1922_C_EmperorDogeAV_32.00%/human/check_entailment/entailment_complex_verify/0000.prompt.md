You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5. Each a_i is a non-negative integer and a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9. Each x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    return prog_cities
    #The program returns prog_cities which is [1, 2, 2]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of city coordinates and determines for each city (except the first and last) whether the next city is closer or if the difference in coordinates to the next city should be recorded. It returns a list where each element corresponds to the result of this comparison for each city between the first and last.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`:** The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum cost to reach the closest city for each city. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function does not correctly determine the closest city for each city. Specifically, the logic for determining the closest city does not consider the unique closest city condition properly. The function should return the cost to travel to the closest city, not just `1` if the closest city is the next one.

2. **Incorrect Use of Prefixed Sums:** The prefixed sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are calculated based on the incorrect values returned by `func_1`. This means that the final cost calculations for the queries will be incorrect.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the cities are very close to each other or when the cities are spread out in such a way that the closest city is not always the next one.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
5
1 5
5 1
2 4
4 2
3 1
```

Expected Output:
```
4
4
2
2
2
```

However, the provided program will likely give incorrect results for this input because the `func_1` function does not correctly determine the closest city for each city.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function and the main logic:

```python
def find_closest_cities(cities, n):
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest_cities[i] = 1
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest_cities[i] = n - 2
        else:
            left_dist = cities[i] - cities[i - 1]
            right_dist = cities[i + 1] - cities[i]
            if left_dist < right_dist:
                closest_cities[i] = i - 1
            else:
                closest_cities[i] = i + 1
    return closest_cities

def calculate_cost_to_closest(cities, closest_cities, n):
    cost_to_closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        cost_to_closest[i] = abs(cities[closest_cities[i]] - cities[i])
    return cost_to_closest

def calculate_prefix_sums(cost_to_closest, n):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + cost_to_closest[i]
    return prefix_sum

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    closest_cities = find_closest_cities(cities, n)
    cost_to_closest = calculate_cost_to_closest(cities, closest_cities, n)
    prefix_sum_f = calculate_prefix_sums(cost_to_closest, n)
    cities.reverse()
    closest_cities.reverse()
    cost_to_closest.reverse()
    prefix_sum_b = calculate_prefix_sums(cost_to_closest, n)
    prefix_sum_b.reverse()
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b:
            print(prefix_sum_f[b - 1] - prefix_sum_f[a - 1])
        else:
            print(prefix_sum_b[b - 1] - prefix_sum_b[a - 1])
```

This corrected version ensures that the closest city is determined correctly and the prefixed sums are calculated based on the correct costs.
