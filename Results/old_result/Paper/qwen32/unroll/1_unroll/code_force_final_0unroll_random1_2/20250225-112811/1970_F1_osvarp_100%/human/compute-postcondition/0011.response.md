To determine the output, let's break down the given information and the print statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `grid` is updated with new positions of elements.
   - `elements` dictionary reflects final positions.
   - `allPlayers` reflects active/inactive status.
   - `goal` remains unchanged.
   - `points` reflect scores.
   - `t` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
   ```

The print statement is formatting and printing the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` in the string 'FINAL SCORE: %d %d'. Here, `%d` is a placeholder for an integer value.

3. **Variables of Interest:**
   - `points` is a list that holds scores. The exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, but we know they represent scores for two players or teams.

Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical values. However, based on the structure and context provided, we can describe the output in terms of the `points` list.

**Output Description:**
The print statement will output the final scores of two players or teams, represented by `points[0]` and `points[1]` respectively.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the scores of the first and second players/teams respectively)**
