Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of `a[l:r + 1]`. If `s` is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `s` is updated to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1) and all elements in the list `a` from index `l` to index `r` (inclusive) are set to the value (r - l + 1), and the tuple `(l, r)` is added to the list `ops`. If `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further changes are made to `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos`.**
