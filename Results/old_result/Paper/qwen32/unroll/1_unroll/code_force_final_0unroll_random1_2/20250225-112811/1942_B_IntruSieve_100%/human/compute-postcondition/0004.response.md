The code snippet provided initializes a dictionary `used` to be empty. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; For each test case, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `used` is an empty dictionary.**
