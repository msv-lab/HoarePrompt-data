### Reasoning:
The given program is tasked with determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicity of each sign. The logic of the program is to iterate through each sign's periodicity and calculate the next occurrence year of each sign, starting from the year after the previous sign's occurrence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0, which represents the starting year.
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next occurrence year:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year` as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - It updates `current_year` to this next occurrence year and continues to the next sign.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `current_year` (which is the year of the n-th sign's occurrence) to the results list.
4. **Final Output**: After all test cases are processed, it prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For each test case, it correctly calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence, considering the sequential nature of the signs' occurrences.
