Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. It then determines the winner of a game (presumably defined in `func_1`) for each test case and prints the result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.**
