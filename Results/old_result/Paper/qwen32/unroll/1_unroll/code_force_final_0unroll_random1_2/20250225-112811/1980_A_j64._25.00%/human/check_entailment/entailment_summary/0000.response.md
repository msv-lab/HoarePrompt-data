### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we will analyze the logic and implementation of the `func_1` function in the context of the given problem description.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples containing `n`, `m`, and `a` for each test case).
   - It iterates over each test case and unpacks the values `n`, `m`, and `a`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency list `freq` of size 7 (representing difficulties 'A' to 'G').
   - It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `freq` list based on the ASCII value of the character.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation:**
   - For each difficulty level, it calculates the number of additional problems needed by taking the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and the current frequency (`max(0, m - f)`).
   - It sums these values to get the total number of missing problems for that test case.

4. **Output:**
   - The function appends the calculated number of missing problems for each test case to the `results` list and returns this list.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2
  - Missing: A=1, B=0, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=1, G=0
  - Total missing = 1 + 1 = 2

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2
  - Missing: A=2, B=0, C=1, D=0, E=0, F=2, G=0
  - Total missing = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
  - Frequencies: B=2, C=1, D=1, E=1, F=2, G=2
  - Missing: A=1, B=0, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=0, G=0
  - Total missing = 1

The program correctly calculates the number of missing problems for each test case as per the example output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
