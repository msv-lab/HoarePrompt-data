You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives input through standard input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) where n is the size of the square grid and k is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)

    #State: A series of printed numbers, one for each test case, where each number is either `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell.
- The total number of diagonals in the grid is `4n - 2`.
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Correctness Check:
Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program behaves as expected.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: We need to color at least 2 cells to ensure that 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- Program Output: `ceil(4 / 2) = 2` (Correct)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 3`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: We need to color at least 2 cells to ensure that 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- Program Output: `ceil(3 / 2) = 2` (Correct)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 10`
- Expected Output: `6`
- Explanation: We need to color at least 6 cells to ensure that 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- Program Output: `ceil(10 / 2) = 5` (Incorrect)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 9`
- Expected Output: `5`
- Explanation: We need to color at least 5 cells to ensure that 9 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- Program Output: `ceil(9 / 2) = 5` (Correct)

#### Test Case 5:
- Input: `n = 4`, `k = 7`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Explanation: We need to color at least 4 cells to ensure that 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- Program Output: `ceil(7 / 2) = 4` (Correct)

#### Test Case 6:
- Input: `n = 7`, `k = 11`
- Expected Output: `6`
- Explanation: We need to color at least 6 cells to ensure that 11 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- Program Output: `ceil(11 / 2) = 6` (Correct)

#### Test Case 7:
- Input: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: We need to color at least 2 cells to ensure that 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- Program Output: `ceil(3 / 2) = 2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program gives incorrect results for Test Case 3 where `n = 3` and `k = 10`. The expected output is `6`, but the program outputs `5`. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells to color for all cases. Specifically, it fails for cases where `k` is close to `4n - 2` and requires more cells than `ceil(k / 2)` to ensure that `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
