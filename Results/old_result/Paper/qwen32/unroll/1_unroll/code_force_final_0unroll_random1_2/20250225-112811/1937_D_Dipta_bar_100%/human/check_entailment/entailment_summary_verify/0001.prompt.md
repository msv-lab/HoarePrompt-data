You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, representing directions in a one-dimensional grid. It calculates and prints the number of cells that are part of a cycle within the grid for each position in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid with specific rules and calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the grid itself.
   - The program then calls `func_1(s)` for each test case to compute the time for each starting position.

2. **Logic in `func_1(s)`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - Two lists, `A` and `B`, are initialized to store cumulative times for pinballs moving right and left, respectively.
     - Two index lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, are used to keep track of positions where '>' and '<' are encountered.
   
   - **Processing Right Movements:**
     - It iterates over the grid to find all '>' characters.
     - For each '>', it calculates the cumulative time it would take for a pinball to reach this position from the previous '>' and adds this to list `A`.
     - The position of the '>' is stored in `idx_A`.
   
   - **Processing Left Movements:**
     - It iterates over the grid in reverse to find all '<' characters.
     - For each '<', it calculates the cumulative time it would take for a pinball to reach this position from the previous '<' and adds this to list `B`.
     - The position of the '<' is stored in `idx_B`.
   
   - **Calculating Output:**
     - For each position in the grid:
       - If the character is '>', it calculates the total time to leave the grid considering both right and left movements.
       - If the character is '<', it similarly calculates the total time to leave the grid.
     - The results are printed for each starting position.

### Correctness Verification:
- The logic for calculating cumulative times and handling the inversion of characters after each move seems complex and potentially incorrect. The provided code does not seem to account for the inversion of characters correctly and does not correctly handle the movement of the pinball in a way that matches the problem's rules.
- The program's approach of using cumulative times and indices might not correctly simulate the exact movement and inversion process described in the problem statement.
- The code does not provide a clear and straightforward simulation of the pinball's movement and inversion process, which is crucial for solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and the way the program attempts to simulate the pinball's movement and inversion, it is likely that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic seems flawed, and the program does not provide a clear, step-by-step simulation of the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters.
