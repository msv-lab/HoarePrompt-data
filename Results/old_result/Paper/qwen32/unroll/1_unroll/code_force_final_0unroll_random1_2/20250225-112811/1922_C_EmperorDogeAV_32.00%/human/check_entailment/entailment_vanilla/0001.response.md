Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads each query, which consists of two city indices `x_i` and `y_i`.

2. **Determining Closest Cities:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to determine the closest city for each city in the forward direction.
   - It reverses the list of cities and uses the same function to determine the closest city in the backward direction.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list where each element indicates the cost to move to the closest city in the given direction (either forward or backward).

3. **Calculating Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward lists of closest city costs.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total cost to move from one city to another using the closest city strategy.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program determines if the starting city index `a` is less than the destination city index `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it calculates the cost using the forward prefix sums.
   - If `a > b`, it calculates the cost using the backward prefix sums.
   - The cost is then printed for each query.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Implementation of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost to move to the closest city. However, it incorrectly assigns `1` when the closest city is forward and the actual distance when the closest city is backward. This logic is flawed because the problem specifies that moving to the closest city always costs `1` coin, not the actual distance.
   - The correct implementation should assign `1` to each element of the list returned by `func_1`, indicating that moving to the closest city always costs `1` coin.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect values from `func_1`. Since the values in `func_1` are incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

3. **Logic for Query Processing:**
   - The logic for processing queries is correct in terms of using the prefix sums, but since the prefix sums are incorrect, the results will be incorrect.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the implementation of `func_1` and the resulting incorrect prefix sums, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
