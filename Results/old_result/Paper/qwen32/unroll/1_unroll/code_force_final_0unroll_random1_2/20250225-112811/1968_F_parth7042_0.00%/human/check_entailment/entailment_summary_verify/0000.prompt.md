You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries. Each query asks whether there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of all its elements is zero. The function outputs "YES" if such a subarray exists and "NO" otherwise, for each query. The results for each test case are printed sequentially, with an empty line separating the results of different test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" as defined in the problem statement. Here is a breakdown of the approach taken by the program:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array. The prefix XOR up to index `i` (denoted as `pf[i]`) is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`. This allows for efficient calculation of the XOR of any subarray.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: The program maintains a dictionary `mp` that maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs. This mapping is used to quickly find indices where the prefix XOR matches a specific value.

3. **Handling Queries**: For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values (`x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`). If this XOR value is zero, it means the subarray can be trivially divided into one part that is the entire subarray, which is considered "interesting".

4. **Checking for Divisibility**: If the XOR value `x` is not zero, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR mapping that allow the subarray to be divided into parts with equal XOR values. Specifically, it looks for indices in the prefix XOR mapping that fall within the range `[l, r]` and match the prefix XOR values needed to divide the subarray into parts with equal XOR.

The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as:
- Subarrays with a single element.
- Subarrays that can be trivially divided into one part.
- Subarrays that require more complex divisions into multiple parts with equal XOR values.

The use of prefix XOR and efficient index mapping ensures that the program can handle the large input sizes specified in the problem constraints.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic and handles all edge cases, the correctness of the program is verified.
