### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its behavior according to the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operation.
   - It iterates over the array from the second element to the second-to-last element (inclusive).
   - For each element `a_i` where `2 <= i <= n-1`, it repeatedly applies the operation as long as `a_i > 1`, `a_{i-1} > 0`, and `a_{i+1} > 0`.
   - The operation modifies the array as follows:
     - `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 * a_{i-1}`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2 * a_{i-1}`
     - `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 * a_{i-1}`
   - After attempting to reduce the array, it checks if the array is all zeros using `func_1`.
   - If the array is all zeros, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues with the Code:

The main issue with `func_2` is the logic inside the `while` loop. The operation is not correctly applied. The operation should subtract `1`, `2`, and `1` from `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` respectively, not multiply them by `a_{i-1}`.

The correct operation inside the loop should be:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```

### Corrected Code for `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation of `func_2`, the program is incorrect because it does not properly apply the specified operation to reduce the array elements. The corrected version of `func_2` should be used to ensure the program works as intended.

**Correctness: False**
