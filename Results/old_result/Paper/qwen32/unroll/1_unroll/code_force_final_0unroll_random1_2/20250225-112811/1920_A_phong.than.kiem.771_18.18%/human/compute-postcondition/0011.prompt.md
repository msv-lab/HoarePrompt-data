You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether the input line should be split into items based on spaces, and to_int is a boolean indicating whether the items should be converted to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `space` is a boolean, `to_int` is a boolean, `line` is a string. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` based on spaces. If `space` is False, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is obtained by converting each element in the list `items` to an integer. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings split from `line` by spaces, and if `space` is False, `items` is a list of characters from `line`. Since `to_int` is True, each element in `items` is converted to an integer.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns `items`, which is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` based on spaces if `space` is True, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is False. Since `to_int` is False, the items are not converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, the function splits a line into substrings based on spaces; if `space` is False, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, each element in the resulting list is converted to an integer; if `to_int` is False, the elements are not converted. The function returns a list of integers if `to_int` is True, or a list of strings (substrings or characters) if `to_int` is False.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list of integers where each integer is obtained by converting each element in the list `items` to an integer. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings split from `line` by spaces, and if `space` is False, `items` is a list of characters from `line`. Since `to_int` is True, each element in `items` is converted to an integer.

Case_2: The program returns `items`, which is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line` based on spaces if `space` is True, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is False. Since `to_int` is False, the items are not converted to integers.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
