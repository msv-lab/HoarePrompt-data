You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It prints the original string `s` after performing a series of operations on it.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: A balanced parentheses sequence (a string consisting of '(' and ')').
2. **Output**: The balanced shuffle of the input sequence.
3. **Balanced Shuffle Process**:
   - For each character in the input sequence, calculate the prefix balance.
   - Create a list of tuples that include the prefix balance, position, and character.
   - Sort this list by prefix balance in ascending order. In case of ties (same prefix balance), sort by position in descending order.
   - Construct the output sequence by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be intended for comparing two `BalanceInfo` objects based on the balance and position as described.
   - However, `func_1` is not used in the provided program, so it's not critical for the correctness of the given program.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
     - `balance_info` is an empty list to store the balance, position, and character information.
     - `balance` is initialized to 0 to track the prefix balance.
   - **Loop**:
     - For each character in the string `s`, a `BalanceInfo` object is created with the current balance, position, and character.
     - The balance is updated based on whether the character is '(' or ')'.
     - The `BalanceInfo` object is appended to `balance_info`.
   - **Sorting**:
     - The list `balance_info` is sorted using a lambda function as the key.
     - The lambda function sorts primarily by `balance` in ascending order and secondarily by `position` in descending order (achieved by negating `position`).
   - **Result Construction**:
     - The characters from the sorted `balance_info` list are joined to form the resulting string.
     - The result is printed.

### Verification:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character.
- It stores the necessary information in the `balance_info` list.
- The sorting step aligns with the problem's requirements.
- The final result is constructed by concatenating the characters from the sorted list, which should produce the balanced shuffle as described.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
