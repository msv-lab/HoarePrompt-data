In the given task, the for loop iterates `numTest` times. The loop head only includes the variable `_` and `numTest`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used just for iteration, we only need to adjust `numTest` to ensure the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `numTest` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `numTest` must be at least 1.
3. The value of `numTest` should be within the range such that the loop can execute the required number of times, which is given as `1 <= t <= 10^4`. However, the initial state only gives us `numTest` as an input integer, and we need to ensure it is within the specified range for the loop to execute correctly.

Given this, we need to adjust the state of `numTest` to ensure it is at least 1 and does not exceed 10,000. Since the problem doesn't specify a value for `numTest` in the initial state, we need to set it to a value within the valid range to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`numTest` is an integer such that 1 <= numTest <= 10^4**
