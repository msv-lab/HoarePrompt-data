N and M are odd integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99. The field is a 2D grid of N lines and M columns, where each cell contains either ".." (empty), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG", "BG" (goals), or ".Q" (Quaffle). P is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10, representing the number of players per team. T is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each step is a valid action performed by an entity on the field, as described in the problem.
