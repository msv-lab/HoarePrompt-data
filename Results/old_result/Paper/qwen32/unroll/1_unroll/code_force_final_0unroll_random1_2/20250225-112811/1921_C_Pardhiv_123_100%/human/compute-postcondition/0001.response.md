The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is within this range, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0, and thus the loop can certainly execute at least once.

No other states need to be adjusted because the condition `t > 0` is already satisfied given the constraints on `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
