### Reasoning:

To determine the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string, we need to identify the points where the string transitions from '1' to '0'. This is because any '1' that appears before a '0' indicates a necessary cut to separate the two segments. 

The logic in the provided program correctly captures this idea by iterating through the string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'. This count represents the number of necessary cuts. Since each cut creates one additional segment, the total number of pieces needed is `count + 1`.

Let's break down the example test cases using this logic:

1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions: `1 -> 0` (at index 1), `1 -> 0` (at index 3)
   - Cuts needed: 2
   - Total pieces: 3

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - No transitions from '1' to '0'
   - Cuts needed: 0
   - Total pieces: 1

3. **Input:** `1`
   - No transitions
   - Cuts needed: 0
   - Total pieces: 1

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transition: `1 -> 0` (at index 0)
   - Cuts needed: 1
   - Total pieces: 2

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - No transitions from '1' to '0'
   - Cuts needed: 0
   - Total pieces: 1

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transition: `0 -> 1` (no cut needed), `1 -> 0` (at index 2)
   - Cuts needed: 1
   - Total pieces: 2

The program correctly identifies the number of necessary cuts and outputs the correct number of pieces for each test case, matching the expected results.
