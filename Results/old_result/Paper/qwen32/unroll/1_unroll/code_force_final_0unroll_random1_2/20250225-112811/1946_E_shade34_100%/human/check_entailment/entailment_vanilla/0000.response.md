To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the problem statement and the given code to see if the code correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that match specific criteria regarding prefix and suffix maximums.

#### Key Points:
- **Prefix Maximum:** An element `a_i` is a prefix maximum if it is greater than all previous elements in the permutation.
- **Suffix Maximum:** An element `a_i` is a suffix maximum if it is greater than all subsequent elements in the permutation.
- **Input:** The problem provides the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, the number of suffix maximums `m2`, and the indices of these maximums.
- **Output:** The number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code Analysis

The provided code consists of two functions:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function appears to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It returns a tuple `(c, d)` such that `c * b + d * a = gcd(a, b)`.
   - If `b == 0`, it returns `(1, 0)`.
   - If `a < b`, it recursively calls itself with swapped arguments.
   - If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and adjusts the result.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` and then multiplies it by `a`, returning the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Evaluation

The provided code does not directly address the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are related to modular arithmetic, particularly for computing modular inverses, which can be useful in combinatorial problems where modular arithmetic is involved.

However, the main logic to solve the problem—counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums—is not present in the given code. The code provided does not include any logic to process the input arrays `p` and `s` (prefix and suffix maximum indices) and compute the number of valid permutations.

### Conclusion

The given code does not implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description is:

Correctness: **False**
