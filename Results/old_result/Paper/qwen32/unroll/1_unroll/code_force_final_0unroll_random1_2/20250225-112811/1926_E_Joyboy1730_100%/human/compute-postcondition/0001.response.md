In the provided task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is greater than 0. 

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is the integer input provided by the user, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the loop head, which only involves the variable `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
