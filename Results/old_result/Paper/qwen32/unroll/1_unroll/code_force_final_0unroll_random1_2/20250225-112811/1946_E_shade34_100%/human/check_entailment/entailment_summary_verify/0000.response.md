### Reasoning:

The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which appear to be related to modular arithmetic, specifically computing modular inverses. However, the code does not include any logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The problem requires analyzing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums to determine the number of valid permutations. The provided code does not handle this logic.

Let's break down the problem requirements and compare them with the provided code:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code does not include any logic to parse the input, which is crucial for extracting the test cases and their respective details (n, m1, m2, prefix max indices, suffix max indices).

2. **Logic for Prefix and Suffix Maximums**: The code does not include any logic to analyze the prefix and suffix maximum indices to determine the number of valid permutations. This involves combinatorial counting and checking the constraints provided by the indices.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: While `func_1` and `func_2` are related to modular arithmetic (specifically computing the modular inverse), they are not used in the context of the problem. The problem requires computing the number of permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but the provided functions are not integrated into any logic that would solve the problem.

4. **Output**: The code does not produce any output for the test cases. It does not include any logic to iterate through the test cases, compute the number of valid permutations for each, and print the results.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` alone are insufficient and not used in a way that addresses the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation
