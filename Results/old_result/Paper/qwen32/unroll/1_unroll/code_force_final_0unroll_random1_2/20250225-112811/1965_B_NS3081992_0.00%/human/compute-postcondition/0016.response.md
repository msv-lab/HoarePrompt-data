The code snippet `ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))` appends a new value to the list `ans`. The new value is calculated as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. Initially, `ans` contains one element, `[2]`. Therefore, `sum(ans)` is `2`. The new value to be appended is `k - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `k - 3`.

After the execution, `ans` will have two elements: the initial `2` and the newly appended `k - 3`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing `[2, k - 3]`.**
