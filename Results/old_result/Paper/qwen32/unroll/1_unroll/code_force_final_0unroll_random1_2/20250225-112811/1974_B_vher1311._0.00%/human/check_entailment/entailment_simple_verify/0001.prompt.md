You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Construct the auxiliary string `r`:** This string consists of all distinct letters of the input string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order.
2. **Encoding process:** Each character in the string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` (the first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on).
3. **Decoding process:** Given the encoded string `b`, we need to restore the original string `s`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program is supposed to perform the decoding process. Let's walk through the logic of the `func_1` function:

1. **Unique Characters Extraction and Sorting:**
   ```python
   unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
   ```
   This line correctly identifies all unique characters in the string `s` and sorts them alphabetically.

2. **Symmetric Replacement Logic:**
   ```python
   (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)
   for char in s:
       if char in unique_chars:
           s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
           j -= 1
       else:
           unique_chars.insert(i, char)
           i += 1
           j += 1
   return ''.join(unique_chars)
   ```
   This code attempts to perform symmetric replacements. However, there are several issues:
   - The code tries to modify the string `s` in place, which is inefficient and incorrect because strings in Python are immutable.
   - The logic for replacing characters is flawed. Instead of replacing characters with their symmetric counterparts, it incorrectly modifies the string and the list of unique characters, leading to incorrect results.
   - The `else` block, which handles characters not in `unique_chars`, is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem since all characters in the encoded string `b` should be in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - The function returns the list of unique characters joined into a string, which is not the decoded string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string, we should:
1. Extract and sort the unique characters in the encoded string `b`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Use this mapping to transform the encoded string `b` back into the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
