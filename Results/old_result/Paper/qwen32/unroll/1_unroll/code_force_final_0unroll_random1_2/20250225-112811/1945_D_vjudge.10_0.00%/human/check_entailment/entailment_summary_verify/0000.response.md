### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect based on the given problem description and the function summary.

#### Key Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue towards the `m`-th position and adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the cost. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people.
   - The program then iterates from the `m`-th position to the beginning of the queue, but the logic here is also incorrect. It does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people and ensuring that Kirill can move to the desired position.

2. **Lack of Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach**:
   - The problem requires a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to efficiently calculate the minimum cost. The provided program does not use such an approach and thus fails to correctly compute the minimum cost in many cases.

3. **Edge Cases and General Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `m = 1` or when all `a_i` and `b_i` values are very large.
   - The program does not handle the general case where Kirill needs to bribe multiple people to move to the desired position, and it does not account for the cumulative cost of these bribes.

4. **Incorrect Logic in Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions and the logic inside the loops do not correctly reflect the problem requirements. For example, the loop `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):` does not correctly handle the case where `num_fila` is equal to `max_p`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
5 15 25 35 45
```
The correct answer for this test case is `20` (Kirill can bribe the second person for `20` coins to move to the second position). However, the provided program will likely not produce this correct answer.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. It fails to handle both edge cases and general cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
