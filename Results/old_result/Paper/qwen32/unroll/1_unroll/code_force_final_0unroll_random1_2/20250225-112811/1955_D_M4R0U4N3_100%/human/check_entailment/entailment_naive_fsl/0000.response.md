Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. The issue lies in the fact that the `cnt_b` array is not reset between test cases. This means that the frequency counts from previous test cases can carry over and affect the results of subsequent test cases.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initialization of `cnt_b`**:
   The `cnt_b` array is initialized outside the main loop that processes each test case. This means that the counts of elements from the previous test case are not reset before processing the next test case.

2. **Effect on Subsequent Test Cases**:
   If the same element appears in both the current and previous test cases, the count in `cnt_b` will be incorrect because it will include the counts from the previous test case. This can lead to incorrect matching counts and, consequently, incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the `cnt_b` array should be reinitialized to zero at the beginning of each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    max_val = 1000000
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)  # Reinitialize cnt_b for each test case
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
        b_values = set(b)
        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

By reinitializing `cnt_b` at the start of each test case, the program ensures that the frequency counts are accurate for each test case, leading to correct results.
