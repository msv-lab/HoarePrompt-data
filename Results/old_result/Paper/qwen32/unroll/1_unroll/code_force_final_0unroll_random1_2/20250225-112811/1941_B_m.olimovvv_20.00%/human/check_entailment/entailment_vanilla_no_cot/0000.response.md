Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the described operations. The program only checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the operations can be applied such that all elements eventually become zero. The key observation is that the operation reduces the sum of the array by 4 each time it is applied. Therefore, the sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero.

Additionally, the operation modifies three consecutive elements, so the sequence of elements must allow for such modifications to propagate from one end of the array to the other. This typically requires that the differences between consecutive elements are even, as the operation involves subtracting 1 from two elements and 2 from the middle element.

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_sum = sum(a)
        if total_sum % 4 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if we can reduce the array to all zeros
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 != 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This implementation first checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 4. If not, it immediately prints "NO". Then, it checks if the differences between consecutive elements are even, which is necessary for the operations to be applicable in a way that can reduce the array to all zeros.
