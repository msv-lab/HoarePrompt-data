### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The key logic in the program is based on the observation that if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have different colors, then for it to be possible to make all squares the same color, there must be at least one pair of adjacent cells in the top row or bottom row with different colors, or at least one pair of adjacent cells in the first and last columns with different colors. This is because if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors and all cells in the top row and bottom row are the same color, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same color, it would be impossible to change the color of the entire grid to a single color.

Let's break down the logic:
1. If the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color, then it's trivially possible to make all squares the same color (by selecting any two squares of that color and coloring the entire grid).
2. If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, the program checks the following:
   - If there is at least one pair of adjacent cells in the top row or bottom row with different colors, it's possible to make all squares the same color.
   - If there is at least one pair of adjacent cells in the first and last columns with different colors, it's possible to make all squares the same color.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

The program correctly implements this logic and checks the necessary conditions for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given operations and conditions.
