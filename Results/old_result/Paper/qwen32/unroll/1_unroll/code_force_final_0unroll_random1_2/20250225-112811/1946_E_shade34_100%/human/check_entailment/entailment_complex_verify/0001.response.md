### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not fully address the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. Let's break down the reasoning in detail:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires counting permutations of length `n` such that the given indices are the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution involves combinatorial counting and possibly dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid permutations.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: 
     - This function computes the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is a standard technique used in combinatorial problems where division under modulo is required.
   - **Function `func_2(a, b)`**:
     - This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` and multiplies it by `a`, returning the result modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is useful for computing combinations and factorials in modular arithmetic.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the annotated code involves:
     - Precomputing factorials up to `200001` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
     - Reading the input for each test case.
     - Checking basic constraints (`p[-1] != s[0]`, `p[0] != 1`, `s[-1] != n`).
     - Using the precomputed factorials and the `func_2` function to compute combinations for the valid regions of the permutation.
     - Multiplying these combinations to get the final count of valid permutations.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The code uses combinatorial mathematics to compute the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximum indices.
   - The logic appears to be correct in terms of using factorials and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.
   - The annotations provide a good understanding of the state of the program at key points, and the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does implement the solution to the problem as described. It correctly uses combinatorial counting and modular arithmetic to determine the number of valid permutations.
   - The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the code does not solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation
