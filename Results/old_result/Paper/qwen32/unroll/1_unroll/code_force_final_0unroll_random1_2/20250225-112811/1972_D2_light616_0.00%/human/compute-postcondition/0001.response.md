The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `n` and `m`, and updates the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `x` is 1; `cnt` is 0.**
