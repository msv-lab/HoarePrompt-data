Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the code is to take the maximum value from all elements except the last one and add it to the last element. However, the problem requires dividing the books into two non-empty piles and selecting the book with the highest number of pages from each pile to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read.

The code does not consider any division of the books into two piles. It simply picks the maximum number from all books except the last one and adds it to the last book, which is not guaranteed to give the maximum possible sum of the two highest books from two separate piles.

For example, in the second test case of the problem statement, the input is `4 2 3 3 1`. The code will output `3 + 1 = 4` (considering `3` as the max of `2, 3, 1` and `1` as the last element), but the correct answer should be `3 + 3 = 6` (by dividing the books into piles `[2, 3]` and `[3, 1]` and choosing the highest from each pile).

Correctness: **False**
