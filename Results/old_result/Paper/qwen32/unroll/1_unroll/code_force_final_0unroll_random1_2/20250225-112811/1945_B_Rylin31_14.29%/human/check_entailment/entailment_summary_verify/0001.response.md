### Reasoning

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible in the sky at the same time. The key points to consider are:

1. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The LCM of `a` and `b` determines the interval at which the fireworks from both installations will overlap in their launch times.
2. **Visibility Interval**: Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes. Therefore, we need to consider the interval `[0, LCM(a, b) + m]` to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.
3. **Counting Fireworks**: The number of fireworks launched by each installation within the interval `[0, LCM(a, b) + m]` is given by `(LCM(a, b) + m) // a` and `(LCM(a, b) + m) // b`. However, we need to subtract the number of fireworks that are launched at the exact same time (i.e., multiples of `LCM(a, b)`).

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):
            print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
        else:
            print(mn // a + mn // b)
```

#### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mn`**: The variable `mn` is set to `min(a, b) + m`. This value does not necessarily represent the time at which the maximum number of fireworks are visible. Instead, we should use the LCM of `a` and `b` plus `m` to determine the interval correctly.
2. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is not a correct way to determine when the maximum number of fireworks will overlap. The correct approach involves using the LCM.
3. **Incorrect Output Calculation**: The output is calculated as `mn // a + mn // b` or `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. This calculation does not correctly determine the number of overlapping fireworks. The number of fireworks visible at the same time is determined by the LCM and the value of `m`.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the interval `[0, LCM(a, b) + m]`.
3. Subtract the number of fireworks launched at the same time (which is the number of multiples of `LCM(a, b)` within the interval).

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        total_time = lcm_ab + m
        fireworks_a = total_time // a
        fireworks_b = total_time // b
        fireworks_both = total_time // lcm_ab
        max_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - fireworks_both
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Final: **False**
