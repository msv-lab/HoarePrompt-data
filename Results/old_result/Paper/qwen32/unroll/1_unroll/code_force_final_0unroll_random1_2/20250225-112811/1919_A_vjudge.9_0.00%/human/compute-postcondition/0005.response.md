Output State: **`a` and `b` remain the same integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively; `t` remains the same input integer representing the number of test cases; `results` remains the same list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` for the corresponding test case. The function `func_1(a, b)` has been executed `t` times, and its results have been printed, but the variables `a`, `b`, `t`, and `results` themselves have not been altered by the loop.**
