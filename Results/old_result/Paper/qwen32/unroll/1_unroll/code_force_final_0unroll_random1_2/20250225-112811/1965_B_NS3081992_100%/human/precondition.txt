d is a list of integers where each integer represents the value of n from the input, processing is a list of integers where each integer represents the value of k from the input, da is an integer representing the number of test cases (t), and rank is not used in the problem description and seems to be an extraneous parameter. It is guaranteed that 1 <= da <= 1000, 2 <= d[i] <= 10^6, and 1 <= processing[i] <= d[i] for each test case i, and the sum of all d[i] does not exceed 10^7.
