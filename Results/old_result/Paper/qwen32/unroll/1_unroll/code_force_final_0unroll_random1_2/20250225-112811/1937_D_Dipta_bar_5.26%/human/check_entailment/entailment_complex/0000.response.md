### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid with specific rules and answer multiple queries based on the initial placement of the pinball on each cell. The program reads multiple test cases, each with a grid configuration, and outputs the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

The core logic of the program is implemented in the `func_1` function. This function uses two main lists, `A` and `B`, which are used to keep track of the cumulative movement of the pinball for '>' and '<' characters, respectively. The function also maintains two index lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to store the positions of '>' and '<' characters.

The algorithm processes the string `s` to populate `A` and `B` with the cumulative movements and then calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position by combining the information from `A` and `B`.

The program's logic appears to be based on the following key points:
1. **Initialization and Tracking**: It initializes the cumulative movement lists `A` and `B` by iterating through the string `s` and updating the lists based on the direction of the characters ('<' or '>').
2. **Combining Movements**: For each starting position, it combines the cumulative movements from `A` and `B` to determine the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: It handles edge cases where the pinball might leave the grid immediately or might require a combination of movements from both `A` and `B`.

The provided comments and the example input-output pair suggest that the program is expected to correctly compute the time for each query. The comments in the code provide insights into the intermediate states of the lists `A` and `B` and their indices, which align with the expected behavior of the algorithm.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided explanation and the logic of the program, the code seems to correctly implement the required functionality. Given that the intermediate states and the final outputs match the expected results, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
