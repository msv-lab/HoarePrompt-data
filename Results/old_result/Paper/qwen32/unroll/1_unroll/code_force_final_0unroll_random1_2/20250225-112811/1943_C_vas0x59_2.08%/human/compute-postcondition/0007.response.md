The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `a` was previously assigned the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` will now hold the same value as `a`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node by an edge; `d` is an updated list of distances from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element indicates the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to the corresponding node; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
