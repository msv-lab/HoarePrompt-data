Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: For a given integer `n` (which represents the sum of the positions of three letters in the alphabet), find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - `n` ranges from 3 to 78.
   - The word consists of exactly three lowercase Latin letters.
3. **Lexicographical Order**: The word should be the smallest possible in terms of dictionary order.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the `string.ascii_lowercase` to map numbers to letters and constructs the word based on the value of `n`:
- If `n > 52`, it constructs the word by taking the letter at position `n - 53` and appending 'zz'.
- If `n > 26`, it constructs the word by appending 'a', the letter at position `n - 28`, and 'z'.
- Otherwise, it constructs the word by appending 'aa' and the letter at position `n - 3`.

### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's verify the program against the provided example test cases:

1. **Input**: 24
   - The word should be "aav" (1 + 1 + 22 = 24).
   - The program constructs "aav" correctly.

2. **Input**: 70
   - The word should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).
   - The program constructs "rzz" correctly.

3. **Input**: 3
   - The word should be "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
   - The program constructs "aaa" correctly.

4. **Input**: 55
   - The word should be "czz" (3 + 26 + 26 = 55).
   - The program constructs "czz" correctly.

5. **Input**: 48
   - The word should be "auz" (1 + 21 + 26 = 48).
   - The program constructs "auz" correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for the given encoded value `n` in all provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
