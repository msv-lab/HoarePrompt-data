Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
Farmer John provides an array `a` of length `n`, and we need to construct a permutation `p` such that for each `i`, `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The MEX (minimum excludant) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation `p`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`.
   - It initializes `minn` to 0, which keeps track of the smallest unused number.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `used` to keep track of numbers that have been used in the permutation.

3. **Iterating Over the Array `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
       - It appends `minn` to the `mex` list (which is the current MEX).
       - It marks `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary.
       - It increments `minn` until it finds the next unused number.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
       - It calculates the number to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - It marks this number as used in the `used` dictionary.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation for each test case, it prints the permutation.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Handling `arr[i] > 0`**:
  - When `arr[i] > 0`, the program correctly identifies the current MEX (`minn`) and appends it to the permutation.
  - It then updates `minn` to the next unused number, ensuring that future MEX calculations are correct.

- **Handling `arr[i] <= 0`**:
  - When `arr[i] <= 0`, the program calculates the number to append as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
  - This calculation is based on the condition `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`, which means `p[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - a[i]`.
  - The program correctly identifies the number to append by taking the absolute difference and ensures it is not already used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `arr[i]` is positive or negative correctly.
  - It ensures that the permutation is valid by keeping track of used numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. It adheres to the problem constraints and correctly calculates the MEX for each step.

**Correctness: True**
