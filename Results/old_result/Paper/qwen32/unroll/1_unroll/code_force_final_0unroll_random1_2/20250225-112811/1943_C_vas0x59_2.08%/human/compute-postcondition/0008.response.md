The code snippet assigns the value of `b` to the first (and only) element of the list `path_ba`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node by an edge; `d` is an updated list of distances from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph as computed by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element indicates the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to the corresponding node; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
