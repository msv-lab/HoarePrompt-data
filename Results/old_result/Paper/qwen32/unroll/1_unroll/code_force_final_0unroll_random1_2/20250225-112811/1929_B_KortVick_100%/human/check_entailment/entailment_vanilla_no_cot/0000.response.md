Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in the handling of cases where the number of required diagonals \( k \) is less than the total number of diagonals \( 4n - 2 \).

Let's analyze the problem more carefully:

1. **Total Diagonals**: For an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. These include both main diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left, along with the diagonals parallel to them.

2. **Minimum Cells to Color**: To cover at least \( k \) diagonals with the fewest cells:
   - If \( k \leq n \), you can color the main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right, which covers \( n \) diagonals. Since you need only \( k \) diagonals, you can color just \( k \) cells on this diagonal.
   - If \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), you can color cells in both the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) to cover up to \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals. You need to color \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) cells to cover \( k \) diagonals.
   - If \( k > 2n - 1 \), you need to color additional diagonals. The optimal strategy is to color cells in the diagonals such that you cover the maximum number of diagonals with each cell. This involves coloring cells in a way that minimizes the number of cells while maximizing the diagonals covered.

The provided program incorrectly handles the case where \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 2 \). Specifically, the program uses `ceil(k / 2)` for all cases except when \( k = 4n - 2 \), which is not the correct approach for all scenarios.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k <= n:
            print(k)
        elif k <= 2 * n - 1:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            # For k > 2n - 1, we need to consider the diagonals more carefully
            # We can cover up to 2n - 1 diagonals with n cells (n-1 from one main diagonal and n from the other)
            # The remaining diagonals need additional cells
            remaining_diagonals = k - (2 * n - 1)
            additional_cells = ceil(remaining_diagonals / 2)
            print(n + additional_cells)

func()
```

This program correctly handles all cases by considering the number of diagonals and the optimal way to cover them with the fewest cells.
