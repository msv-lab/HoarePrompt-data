You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` where each element is a tuple containing the number of problems `n`, the number of upcoming rounds `m`, and a string `a` of problem difficulties. The function returns a list of `t` integers, each indicating the number of missing problem difficulties required to meet the demand for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the function `func_1`. The issue arises from the fact that the program assumes that the minimum number of problems needed is the sum of the deficits of each difficulty level across all rounds. However, the problem requires that each round must have exactly one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. Therefore, the correct approach should be to ensure that for each round, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level. This means that for `m` rounds, we need to ensure that the frequency of each difficulty level is at least `m`.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `n = 7, m = 2, a = 'ABCDEFG'`
- Expected Output: `7` (since each round needs one problem of each difficulty level, and we have only one of each, so we need 7 more problems)
- Actual Output: `0` (the program will output 0 because it sums the deficits of each level across all rounds, which in this case are all zero)

The correct approach should be to check if each difficulty level has at least `m` problems and sum the deficits accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python

    """

        t (int): Number of test cases.

            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:

    """
    results = []

        missing = sum((max(0, m - f) for f in freq))
