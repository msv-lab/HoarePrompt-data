To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `tc > 0` is satisfied right before the loop starts. The variable `tc` is assigned the value of `t`, which is a single integer input (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).

Given the constraints, `t` is already guaranteed to be within the range where `tc > 0` will be true, because the minimum value of `t` is 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `tc` to ensure the loop executes.

Here's the state right before the loop, with no adjustments needed:

State: **`t` is a single integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `tc` is assigned the value of `t`**

Since `t` is within the specified range, `tc` will always be greater than 0, and the loop can proceed with the first iteration.
