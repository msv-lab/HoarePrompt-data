### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine whether the shape formed by '1's in a grid is a square or a triangle based on a simple check. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. The program then checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

However, this approach is flawed for determining whether the shape is a square or a triangle. The program does not correctly account for the specific properties of triangles and squares as described in the problem statement:
- A square requires all rows with '1's to have the same number of '1's, and these '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.
- A triangle, whether upright or upside down, requires the number of '1's in each row to follow a specific pattern (1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1 for an upright triangle or 2k-1, 2k-3, ..., 1 for an upside-down triangle).

The program's logic of simply checking if the first two counts are equal is insufficient to correctly identify the shape. For example, a grid that has rows with counts [2, 2, 1] would incorrectly be identified as a square, but it does not form a square or a triangle as per the problem's definition.
