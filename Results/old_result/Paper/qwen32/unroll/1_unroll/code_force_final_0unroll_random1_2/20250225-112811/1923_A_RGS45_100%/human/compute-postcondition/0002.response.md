To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's break down the provided Python loop and understand what it does:

1. **Loop Iteration (`for _ in range(t)`)**: The loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - `n` is read as an integer, representing the number of elements in the array.
   - The second line of input is read as a string of `n` integers (either 0 or 1), and spaces are removed from this string.

3. **Finding Indices**:
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`. Since `y` is the index in the reversed string, the actual index from the start of the original string is `n - y - 1`.

4. **Substring Extraction**:
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from the first '1' (index `x`) to the last '1' (index `n - y - 1`).

5. **Counting Zeros**:
   - The number of '0's in the substring `z` is counted and printed.

After each iteration, the result (the count of '0's in the substring `z`) is printed. Since the loop runs `t` times, there will be `t` outputs, each corresponding to a test case.

Given the nature of the loop and the operations within it, the state of `t`, `n`, and the input values `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` will not be modified by the loop itself. The only changes occur within the scope of each iteration, affecting variables `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are local to each iteration.

The output state after all iterations is simply the list of results printed for each test case. However, since we need to describe the state in a similar format to the initial execution state, we can say:

Output State: **The output consists of `t` integers, each representing the count of '0's in the substring between the first and last '1' for each of the `t` test cases.**

This description captures the essence of what the loop does and the resulting output state after all iterations.
