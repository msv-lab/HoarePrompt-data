You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The first and second lines of each test case contain strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters only. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: A series of 'No' or 'Yes' responses, one for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing only '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if there exists any pair of consecutive positions in the strings where both strings have '<' characters in a specific pattern, and prints 'No' if such a pattern is found; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
The robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n) by alternating moves of moving freely in any direction and then following the direction of the arrow in its current cell. The robot can only move within the grid, and the arrows are guaranteed not to point outside the grid.

### Key Observations:
1. The robot must switch rows at some point to reach (2, n) since it starts in row 1.
2. To switch rows, the robot must move down from (1, i) to (2, i) or up from (2, i) to (1, i).
3. For the robot to move down from (1, i) to (2, i), the arrow in (1, i) must point right (>) because moving right from (1, i) will place the robot in (1, i+1), and then following the arrow in (1, i+1) must bring it to (2, i+1) or (2, i).
4. Similarly, for the robot to move up from (2, i) to (1, i), the arrow in (2, i) must point left (<) because moving left from (2, i) will place the robot in (2, i-1), and then following the arrow in (2, i-1) must bring it to (1, i-1) or (1, i).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution checks for certain conditions in the grid to determine if the robot can reach (2, n). Specifically, it checks for the presence of two consecutive cells (i, i+1) in the same row where both arrows point to the left ('<'). If such a pair is found, the robot cannot switch rows from that point, and thus cannot reach (2, n).

However, this logic is incomplete and incorrect. The provided solution does not account for all possible scenarios where the robot might be able to switch rows and reach (2, n). For example, it does not consider cases where the robot can use a series of right-pointing arrows to switch rows or navigate to the target cell.

### Correctness:
The provided solution does not cover all possible scenarios and is therefore incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
