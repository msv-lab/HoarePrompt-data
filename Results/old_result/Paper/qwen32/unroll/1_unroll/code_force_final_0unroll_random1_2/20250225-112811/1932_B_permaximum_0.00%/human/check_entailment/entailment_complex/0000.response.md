### Reasoning:
The program's goal is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The logic used in the program is correct based on the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes a variable `year` to 0, which keeps track of the current year.
3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program updates the `year` by adding `ai` if `year` is not already a multiple of `ai`, or by adding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `year`.
   - This is achieved through the expression `year += year % ai or ai`. Hereâ€™s how it works:
     - `year % ai` computes the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is non-zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so it adds `year % ai` to `year` to reach the next multiple of `ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so it adds `ai` to `year` to move to the next occurrence of the sign.
4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The logic correctly implements the requirement that each sign must occur sequentially, with the next sign starting to be considered only after the previous one has occurred.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implementing the problem's requirements and will produce the correct output for the given inputs.

**Correctness: True**
