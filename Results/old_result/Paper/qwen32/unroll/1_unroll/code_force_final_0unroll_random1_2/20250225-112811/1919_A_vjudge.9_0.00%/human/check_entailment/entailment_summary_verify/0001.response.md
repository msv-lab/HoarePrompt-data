To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries systematically.

### Problem Description Recap

- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice and Bob take turns.
  - They can choose to swap wallets or not.
  - They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
  - The player who cannot make a move loses.
  
- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - The game's outcome is determined by whether the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd.
  - If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
  - If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

### Code Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
2. `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`

- **Summary**: This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'; if odd, it returns 'Alice'.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def func_1(a, b):
      if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
          return 'Bob'
      else:
          return 'Alice'
  ```
- **Analysis**: This function correctly implements the optimal strategy derived from the game rules. If the sum of coins is even, Bob wins; if odd, Alice wins.

#### Function `func_2()`

- **Summary**: This function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading `a` and `b`, determines the winner using `func_1(a, b)`, and prints the result.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def func_2():
      t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
      results = []
      for _ in range(t):
          (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
          winner = func_1(a, b)
          results.append(winner)
      for result in results:
          print(result)
  ```
- **Analysis**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases, reads inputs, uses `func_1` to determine the winner, and prints the results. There are no apparent issues in the implementation.

### Evaluation

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's logic is based on the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`) and that this logic aligns with the optimal strategy derived from the game rules. The function summaries and the detailed steps in the original assessment accurately describe the program's behavior.

### Final Answer

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for the game and will produce the correct output for the given problem statement.

**Reasoning**: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which is the optimal strategy for the game.
**Final**: **True**
