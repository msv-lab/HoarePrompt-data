### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav based on the described sequence. Let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (total number of cards) and `k` (position of the card to find).

2. **Case When `k` is Less Than or Equal to `(n + 1) // 2`**:
   - This case handles the first half of the sequence, which consists of odd numbers.
   - The k-th card in this sequence is simply the k-th odd number, which can be calculated as `2 * k - 1`.
   - This is because the sequence of odd numbers is 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., and the k-th odd number is given by the formula `2 * k - 1`.

3. **Case When `k` is Greater Than `(n + 1) // 2`**:
   - This case handles the remaining cards, which are multiples of odd numbers.
   - The program calculates the number of odd numbers (`s`) and the remaining cards (`d`) iteratively.
   - It determines the multiplier (`i`) for the sequence of multiples of odd numbers.
   - It then calculates the position (`f`) within the current sequence of multiples.
   - Finally, it computes the k-th card in the sequence of multiples using the formula `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 1`
  - `k` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` (4), so the result is `2 * 1 - 1 = 1`.
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 7`, `k = 2`
  - `k` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` (4), so the result is `2 * 2 - 1 = 3`.
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - `k` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` (4), so the result is `2 * 3 - 1 = 5`.
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 7`, `k = 4`
  - `k` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` (4), so the result is `2 * 4 - 1 = 7`.
- **Test Case 5**: `n = 7`, `k = 5`
  - `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` (4), so the program calculates the result as `2 ** 1 * (2 * 1 - 1) = 2`.
- **Test Case 6**: `n = 7`, `k = 6`
  - `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` (4), so the program calculates the result as `2 ** 1 * (2 * 2 - 1) = 6`.
- **Test Case 7**: `n = 7`, `k = 7`
  - `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` (4), so the program calculates the result as `2 ** 2 * (2 * 1 - 1) = 4`.

The program correctly handles the provided test cases, and the logic appears to be sound for the problem description.
