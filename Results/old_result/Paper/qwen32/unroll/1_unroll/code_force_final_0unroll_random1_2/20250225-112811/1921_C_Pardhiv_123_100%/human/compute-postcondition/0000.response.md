Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. m is a list of n integers such that 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be an integer input by the user, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
