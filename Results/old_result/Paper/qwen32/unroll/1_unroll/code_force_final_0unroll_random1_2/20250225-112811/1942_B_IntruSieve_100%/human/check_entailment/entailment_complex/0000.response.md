Reasoning: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the rules described. However, there are a few issues with the logic used in the program that would lead to incorrect results.

1. **MEX Calculation**: The program calculates the MEX value using a `minn` variable which is not correctly updated. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation `p`, but the programâ€™s logic for updating `minn` is flawed. Specifically, the program increments `minn` only when a positive `a[i]` is encountered, which does not correctly reflect the MEX value.

2. **Handling Negative `a[i]`**: When `a[i]` is negative, the program calculates `mex[i]` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to determine the value of `p[i]` that would result in the given `a[i]` value when the MEX is subtracted. This involves finding a value `x` such that `MEX(p_1, ..., p_i) - x = a[i]`, which implies `x = MEX(p_1, ..., p_i) - a[i]`.

3. **Tracking Used Values**: The program uses a dictionary `used` to track which values have been used in the permutation `p`. However, this dictionary is not utilized correctly to ensure that the MEX is calculated accurately.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` for the given array `a`. The provided example outputs do not match the logic in the program, indicating that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
