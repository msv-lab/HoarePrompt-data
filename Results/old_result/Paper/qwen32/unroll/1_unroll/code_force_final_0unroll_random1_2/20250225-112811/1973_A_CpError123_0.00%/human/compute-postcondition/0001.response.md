The only objects in the loop head are the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are unpacked from the tuples in the list `cas_de_test`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cas_de_test` list. If the list has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. 

Given that `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples and `resultats` is an empty list, we need to ensure that `cas_de_test` contains at least one tuple for the loop to execute. Additionally, the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be assigned the values from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the values from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`**
