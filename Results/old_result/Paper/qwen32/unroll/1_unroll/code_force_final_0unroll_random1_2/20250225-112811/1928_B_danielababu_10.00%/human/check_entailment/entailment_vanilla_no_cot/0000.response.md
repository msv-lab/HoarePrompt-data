Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not contain any logic to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` to `func_9` are utility functions for input handling and some basic operations like prefix and suffix products, but there is no function that implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

To solve the problem, you need to implement a function that calculates the frequency of each possible value after adding a permutation to the array. The key observation is that the permutation can be chosen such that the most frequent value in the resulting array is maximized. This can be achieved by considering the range of possible values and the distribution of the initial array elements.

Here is a possible implementation of the solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each element in the array
        freq = Counter(a)
        
        # The maximum possible value in the array after adding a permutation
        max_value = max(a) + n
        
        # Initialize the result
        result = 0
        
        # Check the frequency of each possible value after adding a permutation
        for value in range(1, max_value + 1):
            count = 0
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                if value - i in freq:
                    count += freq[value - i]
            result = max(result, count)
        
        print(result)

solve()
```

This code reads the input, counts the frequency of each element in the array, and then checks the frequency of each possible value after adding a permutation. It keeps track of the maximum frequency found and prints it for each test case.
