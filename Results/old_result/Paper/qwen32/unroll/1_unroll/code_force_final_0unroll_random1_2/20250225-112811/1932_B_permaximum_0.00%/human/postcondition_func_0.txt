The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `year` based on the provided integers and prints this value. Specifically, for each integer in the list, it updates `year` by adding either the integer itself or the remainder of `year` divided by the integer, whichever is non-zero.
