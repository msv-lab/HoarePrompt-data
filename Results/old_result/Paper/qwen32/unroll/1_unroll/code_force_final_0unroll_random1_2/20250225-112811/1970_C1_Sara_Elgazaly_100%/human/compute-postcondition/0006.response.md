Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1) where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node for the single round. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, now representing the adjacency list of the tree. `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, now representing the reverse adjacency list of the tree. `z` is an input integer. `tmp` is equal to `z`.**

In natural language: The state remains the same except that a new variable `tmp` is introduced and is assigned the value of `z`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
