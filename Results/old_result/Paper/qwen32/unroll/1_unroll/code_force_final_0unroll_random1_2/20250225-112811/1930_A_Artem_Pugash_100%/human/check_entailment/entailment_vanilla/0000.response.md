### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the score by performing exactly `n` moves, where each move involves selecting two numbers from the list, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both numbers from the list.

#### Strategy:
To maximize the score, we should aim to add the largest possible minimum values from each pair. This can be achieved by sorting the list of numbers in non-decreasing order. By doing so, the smallest numbers will be paired together, ensuring that the minimum value of each pair is as large as possible.

#### Implementation Analysis:
The provided program follows this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n` which indicates that there are `2n` numbers.
   - It reads the `2n` numbers and sorts them.
   - It initializes a score to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first one) and adds it to the score.
   - It prints the final score for the test case.

By taking every second element from the sorted list, the program is effectively summing the smallest element of each pair (since the list is sorted in ascending order).

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's go through the example provided in the problem statement with the program's logic.

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `1 2 3`
   - Sorted: `2 3`
   - Pairs: `(2, 3)`
   - Score: `2` (minimum of the pair `(2, 3)`)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 1 2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 1 1 2 2`
   - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`
   - Score: `1 + 1 = 2` (minimums of the pairs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `3 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`
   - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (minimums of the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`)

The program's output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score by sorting the list and summing every second element from the sorted list.

**Correctness: True**
