To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic that decides the winner of the game based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have.

The key observation in this problem is that the game is essentially about the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins, `a + b`.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is even, Alice and Bob will always be able to mirror each other's moves until the very last coin is taken. Since Alice goes first, Bob will be the one to take the last coin and lose the game. Thus, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is odd, Alice will always be able to take the last coin, making Bob the one who cannot make a move and thus loses. Thus, Alice wins.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements this logic by checking if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If it is true, it returns 'Bob', otherwise 'Alice'.
   - The function `func_2()` correctly reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1(a, b)`, and prints the result.

Given this analysis, the logic in the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

**Correctness: True**
