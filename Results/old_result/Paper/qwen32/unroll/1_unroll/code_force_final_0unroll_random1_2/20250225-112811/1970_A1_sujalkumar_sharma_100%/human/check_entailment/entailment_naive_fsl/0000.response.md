Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error. The function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`. To fix this, the function definition should come before the function call. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result

s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended. However, the original code as provided will not execute due to the `NameError`. Therefore, the correctness of the original code is **False**.
