Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the i-th element (for i from 1 to n) is the total number of 'F' characters in the i-th row (or column) of the input matrix; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the i-th element (for i from 1 to n) is the total number of 'S' characters in the i-th row (or column) of the input matrix; `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all the strings from the input list, with '?' characters replaced by 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions in the loop if `len(sa) < len(sb)`, otherwise `xx` remains unchanged; `sa` is a list of indices of rows (or columns) with 'F' characters but no 'S' characters, plus any additional indices of rows (or columns) that have neither 'F' nor 'S' characters if `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, otherwise it includes indices where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0; `sb` is a list of indices of rows (or columns) with 'S' characters but no 'F' characters, updated to include indices where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0 if `len(sa) < len(sb)`, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the length of `sa` is still greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
