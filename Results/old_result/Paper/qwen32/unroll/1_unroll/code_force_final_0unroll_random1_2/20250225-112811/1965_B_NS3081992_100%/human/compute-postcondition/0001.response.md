To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_14()` within the loop. Since the exact implementations of these functions are not provided, we can only infer the behavior based on their usage in the loop.

1. **`func_10()`**: This function determines the number of iterations of the loop. Let's denote its return value as `n`. The loop will execute `n` times.

2. **`func_14()`**: This function is called in each iteration of the loop, and its return value is converted to a string and printed to the standard output with a newline character.

Given these points, the loop will print the string representation of `func_14()`'s return value `n` times, each on a new line.

Since the initial state does not provide any specific values or states of `func_10()` and `func_14()`, we can't determine the exact values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the number of iterations and the output format.

Output State: **The output will consist of `n` lines, where each line contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` in each iteration of the loop.**
