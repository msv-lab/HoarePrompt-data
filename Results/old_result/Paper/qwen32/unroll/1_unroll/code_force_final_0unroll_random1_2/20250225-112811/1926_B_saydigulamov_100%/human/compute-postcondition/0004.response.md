Functionality: **The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of characters '0' or '1'. It then determines and prints whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a 'SQUARE' or a 'TRIANGLE'. The input values `a`, `n`, and the grid remain unchanged after the function execution.**
