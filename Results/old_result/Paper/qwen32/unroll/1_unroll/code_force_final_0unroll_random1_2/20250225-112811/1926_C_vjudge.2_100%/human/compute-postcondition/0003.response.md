To determine the state required for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `N` in this case. The loop will execute if the range `(1, N)` is non-empty, meaning `N` must be greater than 1. Since `N` is already given as 200001, which is greater than 1, the loop will execute regardless of the value of `i` before the loop starts because the loop initializes `i` to 1 at the start of the first iteration.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `N`), and `N` is already correctly set, we only need to ensure that `i` is set to a value that makes sense before the loop starts. Typically, `i` is not set before the loop in such constructs because it is initialized by the `range` function. But if we must specify a state for `i` before the loop, we can set it to a value that does not interfere with the loop's operation.

Given that the loop starts with `i = 1`, setting `i` to any value before the loop does not affect the loop's execution as long as `N` is greater than 1. For clarity and to adhere to the format, we can specify `i` as 0 (or any other value, but 0 is a common choice to indicate it's not yet initialized in the context of the loop).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `N` is 200001; `pd` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0; `i` is 0**
