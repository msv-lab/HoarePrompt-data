Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y`, where 1 <= x, y < 10^100 and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns the sum of `x` and `y` for each test case.**
