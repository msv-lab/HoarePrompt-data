Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version against the problem description and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine the number of permutations of length `n` such that given indices are prefix and suffix maximums. The output should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Precomputation of Factorials:**
   - The program precomputes factorials up to \(2 \times 10^5\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is useful for combinatorial calculations.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums.

3. **Validation of Indices:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index equals the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it outputs 0, as such a permutation is not possible.

4. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - The program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It uses the precomputed factorials and the `func_2` function, which calculates the modular inverse, to compute binomial coefficients.

5. **Logic in `func_1` and `func_2`:**
   - `func_1` computes the extended Euclidean algorithm, which is used to find the modular inverse.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse and then multiplies it by `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Annotations Evaluation:
- The annotations correctly describe the states and transformations within `func_1` and `func_2`.
- The annotations show how the program uses these functions to compute binomial coefficients.

### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not implement the required logic.
- The provided program does contain logic to handle the permutation constraints using combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to count permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The annotations support this by describing how the program uses combinatorial calculations to determine the number of valid permutations.

Thus, the original assessment was inaccurate.

**Final: True**
