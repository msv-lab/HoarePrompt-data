### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem description and the provided example.

The problem requires us to lay down cards in a specific order:
1. First, all odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
2. Then, all cards that are twice an odd number.
3. Then, all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.

The key insight here is that the sequence of laying down cards can be broken down into segments based on the multiples of odd numbers. For example, for `n = 7`, the sequence is `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`.

For a given `k`, we need to determine which segment it belongs to and the exact position within that segment. 

The program uses a series of calculations to determine the `k`-th card:
- If `k` is within the first half of the sequence (i.e., `k <= (n + 1) // 2`), the `k`-th card is simply the `k`-th odd number, which is `2 * k - 1`.
- If `k` is beyond the first half, the program calculates the position within the subsequent segments.

Let's verify this with the provided example:
- For `n = 7` and `k = 1`, the 1st card is `1` (which is `2 * 1 - 1`).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the 2nd card is `3` (which is `2 * 2 - 1`).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the 3rd card is `5` (which is `2 * 3 - 1`).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the 4th card is `7` (which is `2 * 4 - 1`).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 5`, the 5th card is `2` (which is the first card in the sequence of cards that are twice an odd number).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 6`, the 6th card is `6` (which is the second card in the sequence of cards that are twice an odd number).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 7`, the 7th card is `4` (which is the only card in the sequence of cards that are four times an odd number).

The program correctly handles these cases. For larger values of `k` that fall into subsequent segments, the program calculates the correct position by halving the number of remaining cards and adjusting the segment index.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the `k`-th card in the sequence for each test case. Therefore,

Correctness: **True**
