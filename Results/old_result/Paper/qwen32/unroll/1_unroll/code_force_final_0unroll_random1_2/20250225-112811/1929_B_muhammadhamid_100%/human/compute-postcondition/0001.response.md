To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code snippet provided. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The code reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
3. It then checks the value of `k`:
   - If `k` is 1, it prints 1 and moves to the next test case.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * (n + (n - 2))`, it calculates and prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and prints `k // 2 + 1`.

Given the loop executes `t` times, the output state will be the sequence of printed values for each test case. Since the initial state does not specify any particular values for `t`, `n`, or `k`, we can only describe the output state in a general sense based on the logic of the loop.

Output State: **A sequence of integers, each corresponding to the result of the calculations for each test case as described in the loop logic.**
