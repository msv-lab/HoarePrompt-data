To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it accurately implements the rules of the game and determines the correct winner for each test case based on the optimal strategy.

### Game Analysis:
The game revolves around the total number of coins and the parity (even or odd) of this total. The optimal strategy can be summarized as follows:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The game is symmetric, and the key factor is the parity of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win if both play optimally.

### Explanation of the Program:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2()`.
- `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins (a + b).
- `func_2()` handles input and output for multiple test cases.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **func_1(a, b)**:
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

2. **func_2()**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
   - It stores the result and prints it after processing all test cases.

### Verification Using Annotations:
The annotations describe the program's state at key points:
- **State before `func_1(a, b)` call**: `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
- **Inside `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the program returns 'Bob'.
  - If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, the program returns 'Alice'.
- **State after `func_1(a, b)` call**: The result is stored in `winner` and then appended to `results`.
- **State before printing results**: `results` contains the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the game's optimal strategy. The annotations confirm that the program checks the parity of the total number of coins and returns the correct winner for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which is the optimal strategy for the game. The annotations support this conclusion by showing the correct logic execution.
Final: **True**
