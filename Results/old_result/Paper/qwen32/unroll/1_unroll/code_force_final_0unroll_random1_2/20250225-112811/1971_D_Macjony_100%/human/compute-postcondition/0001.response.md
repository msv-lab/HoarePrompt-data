The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
