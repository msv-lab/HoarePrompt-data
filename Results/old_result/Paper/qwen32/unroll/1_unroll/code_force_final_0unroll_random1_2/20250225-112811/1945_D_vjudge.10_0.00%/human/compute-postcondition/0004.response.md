The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the elements in the `custos` list. For the loop to execute, the `custos` list must contain at least one integer. The state of `c` itself cannot be adjusted before the loop starts because it is assigned a value from the list during each iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `custos` contains at least one integer.

State: **`custos` is a list of integers where each integer is the calculated `custo` value for each test case, and `custos` must have at least one integer**
