You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of cells to color in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The total number of diagonals in an n x n grid is 4n - 2.

The program provided considers three cases:
1. When k <= 4n - 4, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
2. When k == 4n - 3, it prints `2 * n - 1`.
3. When k == 4n - 2, it prints `2 * n`.

Let's analyze each case:

1. **When k <= 4n - 4:**
   - In a grid, the diagonals can be grouped into two types: those that go from the top-left to bottom-right (let's call them main diagonals) and those that go from the top-right to bottom-left (let's call them anti-diagonals). 
   - The number of main diagonals is n, and the number of anti-diagonals is also n, but the middle two diagonals (the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal that go through the center of the grid) are counted twice. Hence, the total number of unique diagonals is 4n - 2.
   - For k <= 4n - 4, we can color cells in such a way that we cover k diagonals with the minimum number of cells. The formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` suggests coloring cells in a way that each cell covers two diagonals, which is possible in many cases. However, this formula doesn't account for the specific arrangement of diagonals and whether coloring a single cell can cover two diagonals without overlap. This part of the logic seems correct based on the examples provided, but it should be rigorously proven.

2. **When k == 4n - 3:**
   - In this case, we need to cover one more diagonal than the previous case. The formula `2 * n - 1` suggests that we need to color cells in a way that covers 4n - 3 diagonals. This formula seems to account for the fact that we need to cover almost all diagonals, and the additional diagonal requires one more cell than the previous case.

3. **When k == 4n - 2:**
   - This is the maximum number of diagonals we can have in an n x n grid. The formula `2 * n` suggests that we need to color cells in a way that covers all diagonals. This makes sense because each cell can cover at most two diagonals, and we need to cover all diagonals, which requires at least 2n cells.

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **For n = 3 and k = 4:**
   - The total number of diagonals is 10. We need to cover 4 diagonals. The formula `math.ceil(4 / 2)` gives 2, which matches the expected output.
   
2. **For n = 3 and k = 3:**
   - The total number of diagonals is 10. We need to cover 3 diagonals. The formula `math.ceil(3 / 2)` gives 2, which matches the expected output.
   
3. **For n = 3 and k = 10:**
   - The total number of diagonals is 10. We need to cover all diagonals. The formula `2 * 3` gives 6, which matches the expected output.
   
4. **For n = 3 and k = 9:**
   - The total number of diagonals is 10. We need to cover 9 diagonals. The formula `2 * 3 - 1` gives 5, which matches the expected output.
   
5. **For n = 4 and k = 7:**
   - The total number of diagonals is 14. We need to cover 7 diagonals. The formula `math.ceil(7 / 2)` gives 4, which matches the expected output.
   
6. **For n = 7 and k = 11:**
   - The total number of diagonals is 26. We need to cover 11 diagonals. The formula `math.ceil(11 / 2)` gives 6, which matches the expected output.
   
7. **For n = 2 and k = 3:**
   - The total number of diagonals is 6. We need to cover 3 diagonals. The formula `math.ceil(3 / 2)` gives 2, which matches the expected output.

Based on the analysis and verification with the provided examples, the program seems to be correct.
