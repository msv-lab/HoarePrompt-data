Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it resets the `cnt_b` array between test cases. The `cnt_b` array is used to count the occurrences of elements in `b` and is modified during the processing of each subsegment of `a`. However, after processing each test case, the program resets only the counts of elements that are in `b_values` (the set of elements in `b` for the current test case). This means that if an element from a previous test case is also present in the current test case, its count will not be reset correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the `cnt_b` array should be fully reset to zeros at the beginning of each test case, or a new `cnt_b` array should be created for each test case. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    max_val = 1000000
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)  # Reset cnt_b for each test case
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
        b_values = set(b)
        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that `cnt_b` is properly reset for each test case, leading to the correct computation of the number of good subsegments.
