### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each \( i \), \( a[i] = \text{MEX}(p[1], p[2], \ldots, p[i]) - p[i] \). The MEX (minimum excludant) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Constructing the Permutation \( p \)**:
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation \( p \).
   - It initializes `minn` to 0, which keeps track of the smallest unused number.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `used` to keep track of numbers that have been used in the permutation.

3. **Iterating Over the Array \( a \)**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array \( a \):
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
       - It appends `minn` to the `mex` list (which is the current MEX).
       - It marks `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary.
       - It increments `minn` until it finds the next unused number.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
       - It calculates the number to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - It marks this number as used in the `used` dictionary.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation for each test case, it prints the permutation.

#### Correctness Analysis:

- **Handling `arr[i] > 0`**:
  - When `arr[i] > 0`, the program correctly identifies the current MEX (`minn`) and appends it to the permutation.
  - It then updates `minn` to the next unused number, ensuring that future MEX calculations are correct.

- **Handling `arr[i] <= 0`**:
  - When `arr[i] <= 0`, the program calculates the number to append as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
  - According to the problem, \( a[i] = \text{MEX}(p[1], p[2], \ldots, p[i]) - p[i] \), which implies \( p[i] = \text{MEX}(p[1], p[2], \ldots, p[i]) - a[i] \).
  - The program correctly identifies the number to append by taking the absolute difference and ensures it is not already used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `arr[i]` is positive or negative correctly.
  - It ensures that the permutation is valid by keeping track of used numbers.

#### Annotations and Validation:

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- `mex` is a list of integers constructed based on the rules specified in the loop.
- `minn` is the smallest integer that has not been used after the loop completes.
- `used` is a dictionary containing all the integers that have been used during the loop.

The annotations confirm that the program is correctly constructing the permutation based on the rules provided.

#### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a valid permutation \( p \) for each test case based on the given array \( a \). It adheres to the problem constraints and correctly calculates the MEX for each step.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: True**
