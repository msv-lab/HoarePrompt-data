Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
There are several issues in the provided code that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect handling of Quaffle catch and throw**:
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who has caught the Quaffle.
   - Similarly, the logic for throwing the Quaffle is flawed. The line `if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:` should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring a goal. The same applies to the blue team goal check.

2. **Incorrect goal scoring logic**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. If a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should get a point, and vice versa.
   - The code incorrectly assigns the Quaffle position to the player's position after scoring in the wrong goal. It should always move the Quaffle to the middle of the field.

3. **Bludger elimination logic**:
   - The code correctly identifies players to be eliminated by the Bludger, but it does not handle the case where the Quaffle is being carried by a player who is eliminated. The Quaffle should remain in the cell where the player and the Bludger are eliminated.

4. **Final score output**:
   - The final score is printed as `print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)`, which is correct, but due to the incorrect logic in goal scoring and handling, the scores may be incorrect.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 0
```

In this example, the red player scores in their own goal, which should give a point to the blue team, but the program incorrectly gives a point to the red team.
