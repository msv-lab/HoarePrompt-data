Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles and then reassembling them. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **First Condition**: `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:`
   - This condition checks if both dimensions are even. If both are even, it prints 'yes'. This is correct because if both dimensions are even, the rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles and reassembled into a different rectangle.
   
2. **Second Condition**: `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`
   - This condition is nonsensical and incorrect. It seems like an attempt to check if one dimension is the negative of the other, which is impossible for positive dimensions. The tuple syntax `(a - b == -a, a)` does not serve any logical purpose here.

3. **Third Condition**: `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`
   - This condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero, which is always true for distinct `a` and `b`. However, this does not correctly determine if a different rectangle can be formed. The logic should consider the possibility of forming a new rectangle based on the dimensions.

4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('no')`
   - This is a catch-all that will execute if the previous conditions are not met. However, the previous conditions are not correctly checking the necessary conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, the logic should be:

- If either `a` or `b` is even, then it's possible to cut the rectangle and form another rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then it's not possible to form another rectangle.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

This logic correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
