You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the size of a square grid and an integer `k` representing the minimum number of diagonals that need to have at least one colored cell. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the requirement for `k` diagonals.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

The code provided is:
```python
import math

def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
```

The logic in the code is not correct for several reasons:

1. **Handling of `k` values**: The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells to color such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The provided code does not correctly compute this for all values of `k`.

2. **Special cases**: The code only handles three specific cases:
   - When `k <= 4 * n - 4`
   - When `k == 4 * n - 3`
   - When `k == 4 * n - 2`
   
   It does not handle other values of `k` correctly.

3. **General logic**: The code does not consider the optimal way to color the cells to cover the diagonals. For example, coloring a diagonal can cover multiple diagonals depending on the position and number of cells colored.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

For `n = 3` and `k = 5`:
- The grid is a 3x3 grid, which has a total of `4 * 3 - 2 = 10` diagonals.
- We need to color cells such that at least 5 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The provided code would output `math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct answer is `2` (by coloring the center cell and one of the corner cells).

Since the code does not correctly handle all possible values of `k` and does not implement the optimal coloring strategy, it is incorrect.

Thus, the correctness is **False**.
