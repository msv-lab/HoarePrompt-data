You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two subsequent elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two subsequent elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Additionally, `arr[0]` is equal to 1. `A` is `False`.
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: - `A` will be either `True` or `False` depending on the number of times it was toggled.
    #   - `not_c` will be `False` if any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, otherwise, it will be `True`.
    #   - The values of `arr`, `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` will remain unchanged.
    #
    #Given that `arr[0]` is `1`, this means there is only one test case. The list `set_` will contain the unique elements from `arr`, which includes `1`, `n`, and the integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
    #
    #Since `arr[0]` is `1`, and assuming there is only one test case, `set_` will be `[1, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` sorted. The loop will iterate over this sorted list and check the differences between consecutive elements.
    #
    #Let's consider the output state in a general format:
    #
    #- If the differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are all ≤ 1, `not_c` will remain `True` and `A` will be toggled based on the number of elements.
    #- If any difference is > 1, `not_c` will be `False` and the loop will break.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `n` and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `A`. However, we can determine the state of `not_c`.
    #
    #Output State:
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is the opposite of its initial value if `not_c` is `True`; otherwise, `A` remains unchanged. `not_c` is `True` if the differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are all ≤ 1, otherwise `not_c` is `False`. The values of `arr`, `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if the final value of `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` of `arr` represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if either the first condition is met or if the final value of `A` is True. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if the final value of `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
