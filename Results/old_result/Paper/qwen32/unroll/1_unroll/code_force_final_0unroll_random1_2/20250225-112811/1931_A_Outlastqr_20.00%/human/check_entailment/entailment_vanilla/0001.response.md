Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (where `3 <= n <= 78`). The letters are indexed from 1 ('a') to 26 ('z'). 

Here is the provided program:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the lowercase alphabet using `string.ascii_lowercase`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.

3. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded word.

4. **Constructing the Word**:
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**
     - The program constructs the word by taking the character at index `n - 53` and appending 'zz'. This means the first character is `alphabet[n - 53]`, and the remaining two characters are 'z'.
     - For example, if `n = 78`, then `n - 53 = 25`, so the character is 'y', and the word becomes 'yzz'.
   
   - **Case 2: `26 < n <= 52`**
     - The program constructs the word by taking 'a' as the first character, the character at index `n - 28` as the second character, and 'z' as the third character.
     - For example, if `n = 52`, then `n - 28 = 24`, so the character is 'x', and the word becomes 'axz'.
   
   - **Case 3: `n <= 26`**
     - The program constructs the word by taking 'aa' as the first two characters and the character at index `n - 3` as the third character.
     - For example, if `n = 3`, then `n - 3 = 0`, so the character is 'a', and the word becomes 'aaa'.

### Checking the Logic:
- **Case 1 (`n > 52`)**:
  - The sum of the indices of 'yzz' is `25 + 26 + 26 = 77`, which is correct for `n = 78`.
  - However, for smaller values of `n` in this range, the constructed word might not be the lexicographically smallest possible word.
  
- **Case 2 (`26 < n <= 52`)**:
  - The sum of the indices of 'axz' is `1 + 24 + 26 = 51`, which is incorrect for `n = 52`.
  - The correct word for `n = 52` should be 'czz' because `3 + 26 + 23 = 52`.
  
- **Case 3 (`n <= 26`)**:
  - The sum of the indices of 'aaa' is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is correct for `n = 3`.
  - However, for higher values of `n` in this range, the constructed word might not be the lexicographically smallest possible word.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases to find the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle cases where `26 < n <= 52` and sometimes does not provide the smallest possible word when `n > 52`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
