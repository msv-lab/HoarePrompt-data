To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the provided code does. The code reads a number of time strings in 24-hour format and converts each of them into 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The variable `t` is read from the input, representing the number of time strings.
2. For each of the `t` iterations, a time string `s` is read.
3. The first two characters of `s` are extracted, representing the hour in 24-hour format.
4. Depending on the value of the hour:
   - If the hour is "00", it is converted to "12" and "AM" is appended.
   - If the hour is between "01" and "12", it is printed as is and "AM" is appended.
   - If the hour is between "13" and "23", it is converted to 12-hour format by subtracting 12 and "PM" is appended.
5. The minutes part (`s[2:]`) is printed as is.
6. The appropriate AM/PM label is appended based on whether the hour is 12 or more.

Given the initial state, where `t` is the number of time strings and each string `s` is in "hh:mm" format, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each representing the corresponding time in 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

Since the input format and the transformation are clearly defined, the output state will be a series of lines where each line is the 12-hour format equivalent of the input time string.

Output State: **Each of the t lines contains a string in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" representing the corresponding input time in 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.**
