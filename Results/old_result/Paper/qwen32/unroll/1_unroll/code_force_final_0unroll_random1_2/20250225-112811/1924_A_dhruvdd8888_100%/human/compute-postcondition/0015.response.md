Functionality: **The function reads input values for `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`, then checks if there are at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters in `s`. If there are, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and, if applicable, constructs and prints a string of length `n` using characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, ensuring it includes the last characters of found sequences and additional characters to meet the length requirement.**
