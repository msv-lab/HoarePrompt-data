Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a result based on these counts and prints the result. The result for each test case is determined by checking if exactly three of the first three counts are odd, adding 1 if true, and then adding half the sum of all four counts.**
