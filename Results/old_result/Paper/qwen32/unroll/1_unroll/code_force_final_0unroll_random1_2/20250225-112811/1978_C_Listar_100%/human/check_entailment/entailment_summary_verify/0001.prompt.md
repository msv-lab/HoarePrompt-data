You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 6 : The function `func_6` retrieves values `n` and `k` from `func_4()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns nothing. Otherwise, it processes these values through `func_1()` and `func_5()`, and finally returns nothing.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`. The Manhattan value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element in the permutation and its position in the sorted order.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - Reads input values `n` and `k`.
   - Checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. This is `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even.
   - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - It initializes a list `l` as a permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It processes the list in reverse order, adjusting it to increase the Manhattan value by swapping elements.
   - The function `func_2` is called when the remaining `k` can be achieved by a single swap.
   - The function `func_3` is called to swap elements to increase the Manhattan value.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Swaps two elements in the list `l` to achieve the remaining Manhattan value `k`.
   - It swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `-c - k`.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - Swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `c - 1`.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - Prints "YES" and the permutation.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**:
   - Calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is `0`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and then calls `func_5` to print it.

### Correctness Analysis

- The program correctly identifies that if `k` is odd, there is no permutation that can achieve it because the Manhattan value is always even.
- The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value correctly based on whether `n` is odd or even.
- The logic in `func_1` to construct the permutation seems complex and may not be correctly implemented to achieve all possible `k` values for all `n`.

However, the critical issue lies in the logic of `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. The provided solution does not guarantee that it can construct a valid permutation for all valid `k` values. The swapping logic in `func_1` and `func_3` does not ensure that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value `k` for all cases.

### Conclusion

Given the complexity and the lack of clear documentation or proof of correctness for the swapping logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, it is not certain that the program will correctly generate a permutation for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
