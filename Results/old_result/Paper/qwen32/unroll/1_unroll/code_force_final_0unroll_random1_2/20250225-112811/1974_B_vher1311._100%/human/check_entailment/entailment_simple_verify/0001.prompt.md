You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and 1 <= len(b) <= 2 * 10^5. The length of the list encoded is t, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all strings in encoded does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string where each character from the strings in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed `r`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it accurately performs the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings (`data`).
   - It then processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the encoded string `b` to get the decoded string.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It constructs the auxiliary string `r` by taking the set of unique characters from `b`, sorting them alphabetically, and joining them into a string.
   - It creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value in the `mapping` dictionary.

### Verification of the Decoding Process:

- **Construction of `r`:** This step correctly identifies the distinct characters in `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
- **Mapping Creation:** The dictionary `mapping` correctly pairs each character in `r` with its symmetric counterpart.
- **Decoding:** The decoded string is constructed by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value, which reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement using the logic of the program:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`
  - Distinct characters in `b` sorted: `r = "cdefors"`
  - Mapping: `{'c': 's', 'd': 'r', 'e': 'o', 'f': 'f', 'o': 'e', 'r': 'd', 's': 'c'}`
  - Decoded string: `"codeforces"` (matches the expected output)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Encoded string `b = "ttf"`
  - Distinct characters in `b` sorted: `r = "ft"`
  - Mapping: `{'f': 't', 't': 'f'}`
  - Decoded string: `"fft"` (matches the expected output)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Encoded string `b = "tlrhgmaoi"`
  - Distinct characters in `b` sorted: `r = "aeghilortm"`
  - Mapping: `{'a': 'm', 'e': 'l', 'g': 'h', 'h': 'g', 'i': 'o', 'l': 'e', 'm': 'a', 'o': 'i', 'r': 't', 't': 'r'}`
  - Decoded string: `"algorithm"` (matches the expected output)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Encoded string `b = "w"`
  - Distinct characters in `b` sorted: `r = "w"`
  - Mapping: `{'w': 'w'}`
  - Decoded string: `"w"` (matches the expected output)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Encoded string `b = "hnndledmnhlttin"`
  - Distinct characters in `b` sorted: `r = "dehilmnnott"`
  - Mapping: `{'d': 't', 'e': 'o', 'h': 'n', 'i': 'n', 'l': 'l', 'm': 'h', 'n': 'i', 'o': 'e', 't': 'd'}`
  - Decoded string: `"meetinthemiddle"` (matches the expected output)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It accurately constructs the auxiliary string `r`, creates the correct mapping, and decodes the encoded string `b` to produce the original string `s`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
