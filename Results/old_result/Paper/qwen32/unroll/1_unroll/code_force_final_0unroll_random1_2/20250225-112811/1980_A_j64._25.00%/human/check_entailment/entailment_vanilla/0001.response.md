Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine if the given program is correct based on the provided problem description:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each with one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - He has `n` problems in his bank, each with a given difficulty level.
   - He needs to determine the minimum number of additional problems he needs to create such that he can hold `m` rounds.

2. **Approach**:
   - For each test case, we need to count the number of problems of each difficulty level in the bank.
   - We then need to check if there are enough problems of each level to cover `m` rounds.
   - For each difficulty level that does not have enough problems, we calculate how many more problems are needed and sum these values to get the total number of additional problems required.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The code initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (for 'A' to 'G').
   - It then iterates over the string `a` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level and stores these counts in `freq`.
   - It calculates the missing problems for each difficulty level by computing `max(0, m - f)` where `f` is the count of problems of that difficulty level.
   - It sums up these missing values to determine the total number of additional problems needed.

4. **Code Review**:
   - The code correctly initializes the frequency array and counts the occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - It correctly calculates the missing problems for each difficulty level and sums these values.
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and returns the correct results.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the code with the provided example:
     - For the first test case (`10 1 BGECDCBDED`), the code correctly identifies that 2 more problems are needed (one 'A' and one 'F').
     - For the second test case (`10 2 BGECDCBDED`), the code correctly identifies that 5 more problems are needed.
     - For the third test case (`9 1 BBCDEFFGG`), the code correctly identifies that 1 more problem is needed (one 'A').

Based on this reasoning and verification, the code appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
