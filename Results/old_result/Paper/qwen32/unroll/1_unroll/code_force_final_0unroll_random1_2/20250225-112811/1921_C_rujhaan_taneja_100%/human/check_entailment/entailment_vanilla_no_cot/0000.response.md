Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Charge Consumption**: The program calculates the charge consumption incorrectly. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that turning the phone on and off consumes `b` units of charge, and it does not correctly handle the situation where the phone needs to be turned off and on between message sends.

2. **Logic for Deciding When to Turn Off and On**: The program does not properly decide when to turn the phone off and on. It only considers the time intervals between messages and whether they are less than `b / a`, but it does not account for the charge required to turn the phone on and off.

3. **Charge Calculation**: The program incorrectly sums up the charge consumption and compares it to `f`. It does not correctly simulate the process of sending messages and turning the phone on and off, which is necessary to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.

4. **Output Case Sensitivity**: While the problem statement allows for case-insensitive output, the program does not handle this explicitly, although it would not cause a correctness issue in this context.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    test_cases = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(data[index])
        f = int(data[index + 1])
        a = int(data[index + 2])
        b = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        
        arr = [int(data[index + i]) for i in range(n)]
        index += n
        
        charge = f
        prev_time = 0
        
        for time in arr:
            time_diff = time - prev_time
            if time_diff * a <= charge:
                charge -= time_diff * a
            else:
                if charge < b:
                    print('NO')
                    break
                charge -= b
                charge -= a
            prev_time = time
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version properly simulates the process of sending messages and turning the phone on and off, ensuring that Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.
