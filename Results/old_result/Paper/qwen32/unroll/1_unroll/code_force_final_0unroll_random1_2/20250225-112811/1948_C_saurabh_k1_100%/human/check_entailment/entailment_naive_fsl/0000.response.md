Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully capture the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The current implementation only checks for certain patterns of '<' and '>' in the grid and prints "No" if those patterns are found. However, it does not simulate the robot's movement according to the problem description.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
4
>>><
>>><
```
**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```
**Actual Output:**
```
No
```

Explanation of the counterexample:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (1, 2) and then follow the arrow to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it can move to (2, 3) and then follow the arrow to (2, 4).
- Therefore, the robot can reach (2, 4).

The provided program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and does not handle all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
