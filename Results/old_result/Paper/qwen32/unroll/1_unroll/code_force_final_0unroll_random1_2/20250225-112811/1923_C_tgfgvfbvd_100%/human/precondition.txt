t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case is a tuple (n, q, c, queries) where n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5, c is a list of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and queries is a list of q tuples where each tuple (l_i, r_i) satisfies 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
