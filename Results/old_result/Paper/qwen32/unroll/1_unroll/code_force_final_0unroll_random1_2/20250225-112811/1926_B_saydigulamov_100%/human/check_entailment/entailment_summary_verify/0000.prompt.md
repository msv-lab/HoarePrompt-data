You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of characters '0' or '1'. It then determines and prints whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a 'SQUARE' or a 'TRIANGLE'. The input values `a`, `n`, and the grid remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a triangle or a square. The current implementation only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the issue:
```
Input:
1
3
010
111
010

Expected Output:
TRIANGLE

Actual Output:
SQUARE
```
In the above example, the grid contains a triangle, but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square because the number of '1's in the first and second rows are not equal.

The program needs to correctly identify the pattern of '1's in the grid for both triangles and squares, which involves checking the structure of the shape, not just the count of '1's in the first few rows.
