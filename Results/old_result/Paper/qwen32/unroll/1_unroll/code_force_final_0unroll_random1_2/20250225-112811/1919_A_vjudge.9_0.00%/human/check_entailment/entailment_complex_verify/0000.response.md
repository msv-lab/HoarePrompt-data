### Reasoning:

The original assessment appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with their wallets.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - Both play optimally.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The game's outcome depends on the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function checks if the sum of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd and returns 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly. This logic aligns with the problem description.
   - `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the result for each test case. This function also adheres to the problem description.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic based on the problem description. It correctly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in both players' wallets.
   - The annotated code confirms that `func_1` correctly determines the winner by checking the parity of `a + b`.
   - The annotated code also confirms that `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` (1 to 10^9) as specified in the problem description.
   - There are no edge cases within the given constraints that the code does not handle correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on whether the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd. This matches the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. No edge cases were found where the program fails to produce the expected result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
