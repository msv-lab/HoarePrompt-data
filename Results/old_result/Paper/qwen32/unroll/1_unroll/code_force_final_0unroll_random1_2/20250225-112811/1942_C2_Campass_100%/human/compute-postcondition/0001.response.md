Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value read from the input, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. All other variables and conditions remain as specified in the initial state.
