To determine the output state, we need to understand the operations being performed in the code snippet. The code snippet is attempting to join characters from the `encoded` list after mapping each character according to the `mapping` dictionary.

Given the initial state:
- `encoded` is a list of strings.
- `r` is a string containing unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order.
- `mapping` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order from the end of `r`.

The code snippet:
```python
return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
```
However, there is a logical issue with the code as it is written. The generator expression `mapping[char] for char in encoded` attempts to map each string in `encoded` directly, which is incorrect since `mapping` is defined for individual characters, not strings.

Assuming the intention was to map each character in each string within `encoded`, the correct code would look something like this:
```python
return ''.join(mapping[char] for string in encoded for char in string)
```

Given this corrected understanding, we proceed with the following:
- For each string in `encoded`, each character is mapped using `mapping`.
- The mapped characters are then joined together into a single string.

Since `mapping` reverses the order of characters in `r`, and `r` contains unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, the output will be a string where each character from the strings in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed `r`.

Output State: **The program returns a string where each character from the strings in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed `r`.**
