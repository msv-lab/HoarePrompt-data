### Reasoning:

The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by checking specific patterns in the grid's rows. However, the logic used in the program is not sufficient to correctly determine whether the robot can reach the destination cell (2, n).

The program's logic checks for the presence of a specific pattern where both rows have '<' characters in consecutive positions, but this does not cover all possible scenarios for the robot's movement. The robot can also move up and down, and the logic should consider all possible moves and paths the robot can take, not just the pattern of '<' characters.

The correct approach would involve simulating the robot's movement step-by-step or using a more comprehensive algorithm to determine if a path exists from (1, 1) to (2, n). The current logic does not account for the robot's ability to move up and down, and it only checks for a specific pattern which is not a comprehensive solution to the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**
