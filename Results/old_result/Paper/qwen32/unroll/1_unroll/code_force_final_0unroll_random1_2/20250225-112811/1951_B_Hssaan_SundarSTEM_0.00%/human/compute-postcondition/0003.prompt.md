You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k where 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= k <= n. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        h = s[0]
        
        j = -1
        
        for i in s[1:]:
            j += 1
            if h < i:
                break
            else:
                ans += 1
        
        p = j
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans1 = 0
        
        s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
        
        z = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        
        print(max(ans, ans1))
        
    #State: a list of integers where each integer is the result of the maximum of `ans` and `ans1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in a list and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`. It also accepts a list of `n` distinct integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided integers and list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
