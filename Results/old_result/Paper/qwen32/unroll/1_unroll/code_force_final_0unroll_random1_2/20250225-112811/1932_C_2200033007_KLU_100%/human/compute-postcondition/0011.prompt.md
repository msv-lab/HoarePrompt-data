You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: The list `b` will contain all elements of `a` but in a new order determined by the string `s`. The indices `l` and `r` will be `n` and `-1` respectively, as `l` will have been incremented `n` times and `r` decremented `n` times, assuming all 'L's and 'R's are used to their full extent. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `ans` is `[p1, p2, ..., pn]` where each `pi` is the cumulative product modulo `m` of the elements of `b` in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list [pn, ..., p2, p1] where each pi is the cumulative product modulo m of the elements of b in reverse order, but now the list is in the opposite order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer used as the modulus), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). The function returns a list where each element is the cumulative product modulo `m` of the elements of `a` in reverse order, but the resulting list is itself in reverse order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list [pn, ..., p2, p1] where each pi is the cumulative product modulo m of the elements of b in reverse order, but now the list is in the opposite order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
