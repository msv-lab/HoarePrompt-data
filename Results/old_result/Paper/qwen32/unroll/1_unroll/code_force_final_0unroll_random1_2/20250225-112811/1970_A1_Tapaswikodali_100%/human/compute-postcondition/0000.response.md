The code snippet assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. The string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000. Since the length of `s` is calculated and assigned to `n`, the value of `n` will be the number of characters in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**
