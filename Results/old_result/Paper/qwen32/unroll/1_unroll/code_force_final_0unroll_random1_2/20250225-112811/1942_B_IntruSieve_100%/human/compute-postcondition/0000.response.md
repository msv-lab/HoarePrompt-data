Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; For each test case, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.**

In simple terms, `n` has been assigned the value of the integer input, while the other conditions and variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged.
