In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range based on the input `n`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable here is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when the loop variable is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute `n` times, once for each test case.

Given the context, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`, but since `_` is not used in the loop body, adjusting its value doesn't affect the execution of the loop. The loop will execute `n` times based on the input value `n`.

The state before the loop starts involves the value of `n`, which is already provided and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop will run `n` times as long as `n` is within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustment in terms of the loop's execution. The state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute `n` times.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4**
