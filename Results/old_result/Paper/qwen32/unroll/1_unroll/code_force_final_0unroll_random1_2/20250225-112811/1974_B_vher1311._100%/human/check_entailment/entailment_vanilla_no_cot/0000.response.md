To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if it correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

The program performs the following steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` to decode the string `b`.
4. The function `func_1`:
   - Constructs the string `r` by taking the distinct characters of `b` and sorting them alphabetically.
   - Creates a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped character.
5. The program collects the decoded strings for all test cases and prints them.

Let's analyze whether this approach correctly decodes the string:

- The construction of `r` as the sorted set of characters from `b` is correct because it matches the description of the encoding process.
- The mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character is also correct because it reverses the encoding process.
- The decoding step, which replaces each character in `b` using the mapping, correctly reconstructs the original string `s`.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm.
