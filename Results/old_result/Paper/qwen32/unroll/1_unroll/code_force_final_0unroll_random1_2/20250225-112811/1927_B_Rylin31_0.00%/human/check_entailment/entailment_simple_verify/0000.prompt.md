You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description and the given examples.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a trace of a string `s` which is an array `a` of length `n` where `a_i` is the number of indices `j` (where `j < i`) such that `s_i = s_j`.
- We need to reconstruct a string `s` from this trace.
- The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters ('a' to 'z').

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the length `n` of the string.
2. Reads the trace array `a`.
3. Initializes a list of lowercase letters `alp`.
4. Reverses the trace array `a` into `rev_array`.
5. Iterates through each position `j` in the array and appends a letter from `alp` to the result `ans` based on the count of `rev_array[j]` in the remaining part of `rev_array`.
6. Prints the resulting string.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Reversing the Array**: The program reverses the input array `a` and then works with the reversed array `rev_array`. This is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect results because the trace array is meant to be processed in its original order.
2. **Counting Logic**: The program counts occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the remaining part of `rev_array` to determine the letter to append. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly map the trace values to the appropriate letters.

### Correctness Check:
Let's consider the example inputs provided:
- For the trace `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`, the program should output a string like `abracadabra`.
- For the trace `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`, the program should output a string like `codeforces`.
- For the trace `[0]`, the program should output `a`.
- For the trace `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, the program should output a string like `dijkstra`.
- For the trace `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the program should output a string like `aaaaaaaa`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the first example:
- Input: `11 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4`
- Expected Output: `abracadabra` (or any valid string)
- Actual Output: The program might not produce the correct string due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly reconstruct the string from the trace array due to the incorrect logic and unnecessary reversal of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. The program does not correctly reconstruct the string from the trace array for all potential cases, as demonstrated by the flawed logic and unnecessary reversal of the array.
