### Reasoning:

Let's carefully evaluate the correctness of the provided program, focusing on the function `func_1`, which is responsible for constructing the permutation based on the given `n` and `k`.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that the Manhattan value \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \) equals \( k \).
- If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".
- If such a permutation exists, we output "Yes" followed by the permutation.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input values \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is even. If not, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation can exist.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k`:
     - If \( n \) is odd, `max_k` is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If \( n \) is even, `max_k` is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `max_k` is less than \( k \), it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs a permutation for given \( n \) and \( k \) (where \( k \) is already halved).
   - It initializes a list `l` with values from \( 1 \) to \( n \).
   - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, adjusting the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic for adjusting the list is complex and relies on moving the last element to specific positions based on the value of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to get \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is 0 (indicating no valid permutation), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and `func_3` to print it.

#### Issues and Correctness:

- The code correctly identifies that the Manhattan value can only be achieved if \( k \) is even.
- The calculation of `max_k` is correct based on the problem constraints.
- The logic in `func_1` is complex and may not correctly construct a permutation for all valid \( k \). The key concern is whether `func_1` can always produce a permutation with the exact Manhattan value \( k \).

Let's analyze the logic in `func_1` more closely:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        k = k - i + 1
        x = l[-1]
        l.pop(-1)
        l.insert(0, x)
```

- The function initializes a list `l` with values from 1 to \( n \).
- It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, adjusting the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
- The logic involves moving the last element to specific positions based on the value of `k`.

The main issue with `func_1` is that it does not guarantee that the resulting Manhattan value will always be \( k \) for all valid test cases. Specifically, the logic for moving elements and adjusting `k` is not well-defined and may not account for all possible values of `k`.

#### Example Analysis:

Consider the test case `n = 3, k = 4`:

- The function `func_1` is called with `n = 3` and `k = 2` (since `k` is halved).
- The initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The loop starts with `i = 2`:
  - `k = 2`, `1 + i = 3`, so `1 + i > k` is false.
  - `k = k - i + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`.
  - The last element `3` is moved to the front, resulting in `[3, 1, 2]`.
- The loop continues with `i = 1`:
  - `k = 1`, `1 + i = 2`, so `1 + i > k` is false.
  - `k = k - i + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1`.
  - The last element `2` is moved to the front, resulting in `[2, 3, 1]`.
- The loop continues with `i = 0`:
  - `k = 1`, `1 + i = 1`, so `1 + i > k` is false.
  - `k = k - i + 1 = 1 - 0 + 1 = 2`.
  - The last element `1` is moved to the front, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The loop ends, and the final list is `[1, 2, 3]`, which has a Manhattan value of 0, not 4.

This example demonstrates that the logic in `func_1` does not correctly construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:

The code does not guarantee correctness for all valid inputs because the logic in `func_1` may not always produce a permutation with the exact Manhattan value \( k \).

**Final: False**
