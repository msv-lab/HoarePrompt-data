Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` such that for each index `i` from `1` to `n`, the array `a` is defined as:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
where \(\texttt{MEX}\) is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to construct the permutation `p` in reverse order. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Reverse Construction**:
   - The program iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as:
     \[ \text{res}[i] = \text{mex} - \text{ar}[i] \]
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `res[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The resulting permutation `res` is printed for each test case.

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- The program initializes `res` as a list of `None` values and `mex` as `n`.
- It iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order.
- For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` and updates `mex`.

### Issues in the Solution:
The reverse construction approach is flawed because:
- The `mex` variable is updated based on the current `res[i]` value, which might not reflect the true MEX of the constructed prefix of `p` up to that point.
- The MEX value should be dynamically recalculated based on the elements already placed in `res` up to the current index, not just based on the previous `mex` and the current `ar[i]`.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a set `available` initialized with numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Initialize an empty list `res` to store the resulting permutation.

2. **Forward Construction**:
   - For each element `ar[i]` in the array `ar`, calculate the MEX value from the `available` set.
   - Determine `p[i]` as:
     \[ p[i] = \text{MEX} - \text{ar}[i] \]
   - Remove `p[i]` from the `available` set.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the resulting permutation `res` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided solution, it does not guarantee to produce a correct permutation `p` for the given array `a`. Therefore, the correctness of the solution is:

**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
