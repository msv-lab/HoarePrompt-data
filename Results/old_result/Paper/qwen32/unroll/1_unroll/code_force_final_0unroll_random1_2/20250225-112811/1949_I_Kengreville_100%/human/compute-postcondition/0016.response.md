The given `print` statement in the code is:

```python
print('NO')
```

The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement. This means that regardless of the values of the variables `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok`, the `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Here's the explanation step-by-step:
1. The `print` function is called with the argument `'NO'`.
2. The argument `'NO'` is a string literal.
3. The `print` function outputs the string literal as it is.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
