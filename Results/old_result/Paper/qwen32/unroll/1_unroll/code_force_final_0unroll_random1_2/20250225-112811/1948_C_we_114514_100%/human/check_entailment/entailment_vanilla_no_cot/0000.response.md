Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the provided problem description and examples. The logic in `func_1` is too simplistic and does not account for all possible paths the robot can take according to the rules specified.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:
1. The function `func_1` only checks specific patterns in the arrows without simulating the robot's movement step-by-step according to the rules.
2. It does not consider all possible moves the robot can make (left, right, down, up) and the subsequent move based on the arrow in the current cell.
3. The function does not handle all edge cases and does not correctly simulate the robot's journey through the grid.

For example, the third test case in the example input-output pair shows a scenario where the robot cannot reach (2, n) because of the specific arrangement of arrows, but the current implementation would incorrectly return 'YES'.

To correctly solve the problem, the robot's movement should be simulated for each test case, considering all possible moves and the subsequent movement based on the arrow in the current cell. This would require a more detailed and accurate implementation.
