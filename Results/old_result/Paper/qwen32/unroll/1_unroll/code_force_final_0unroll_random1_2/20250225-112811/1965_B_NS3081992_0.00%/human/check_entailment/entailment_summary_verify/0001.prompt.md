You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 15 : The function `func_15` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a sequence, and outputs the result of processing each sequence on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_11`) that are not directly related to solving the problem, and two main functions (`func_14` and `func_15`).

- `func_14`: This function appears to generate the sequence for a given pair `(n, k)`.
- `func_15`: This function reads the number of test cases and applies `func_14` to each test case.

Let's analyze `func_14` in detail:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads `n` and `k` using `func_7`.

2. **Handling Special Case `k == 1`:**
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[2]`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Handling General Case `k != 1`:**
   - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Finally, it adds powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Evaluation:

- **Special Case `k == 1`:**
  - The sequence `[2]` works for `n == 2` because the only possible sums are `0` and `2`, and `1` cannot be formed.
  - For other values of `n`, the sequence `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 ensures that all sums up to `n` except `1` can be formed.

- **General Case `k != 1`:**
  - The sequence constructed ensures that all sums up to `n` except `k` can be formed.
  - The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of the sequence elements.
  - The powers of 2 ensure that all sums up to `n` can be formed, except `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs sequences that satisfy the problem's conditions for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
