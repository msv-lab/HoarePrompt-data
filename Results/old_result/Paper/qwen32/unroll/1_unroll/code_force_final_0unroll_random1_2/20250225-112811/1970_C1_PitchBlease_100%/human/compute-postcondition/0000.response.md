The code snippet initializes a queue with a tuple containing the `start` node and the distance `0`. This means the queue now holds the initial node to start the BFS from, along with its distance from itself, which is `0`. The `start`, `target`, and `tree` variables remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree with keys as node integers and values as lists of neighboring node integers, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `((start, 0))`.**
