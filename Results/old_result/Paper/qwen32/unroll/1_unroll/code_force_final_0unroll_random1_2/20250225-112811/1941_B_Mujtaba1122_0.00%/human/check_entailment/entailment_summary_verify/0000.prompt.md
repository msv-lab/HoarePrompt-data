You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` modifies a list of non-negative integers by reducing certain elements based on specific conditions and then checks a condition using `func_1`. It prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program includes a potentially modified list and a printed message indicating the result of the check.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described operations to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Let's analyze the issues with the code:

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation:**
   - The operation defined in the problem description is to subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` for an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1). 
   - However, in the code, the operation is implemented as:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     This is incorrect because it subtracts `list[i-1]` times 1 from `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` times 2 from `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` times 1 from `list[i+1]`. It should simply subtract 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `a[i-1]` is 0, the operation should not be performed because it would result in negative values, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the function that properly implements the described operations and checks if all elements can be made zero:

```python
def can_make_all_zero(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, arr in test_cases:
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(arr) % 2 != 0:
            results.append("NO")
            continue
        
        # Try to make all elements zero
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            while arr[i] > 1 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
                arr[i - 1] -= 1
                arr[i] -= 2
                arr[i + 1] -= 1
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in arr):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

results = can_make_all_zero(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version properly implements the operations and checks if all elements can be made zero, ensuring that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
