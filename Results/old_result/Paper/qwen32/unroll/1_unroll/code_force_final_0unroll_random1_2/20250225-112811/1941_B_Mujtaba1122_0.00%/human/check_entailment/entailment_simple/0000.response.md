### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine if an array can be reduced to all zeros using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and modifying the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array elements.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is responsible for attempting to reduce the array to all zeros.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (inclusive).
   - For each index \( i \), it repeatedly applies the operation as long as \( a_{i-1} > 0 \), \( a_i > 1 \), and \( a_{i+1} > 0 \).
   - The operation is applied by subtracting \( a_{i-1} \) from \( a_{i-1} \), \( 2 \times a_{i-1} \) from \( a_i \), and \( a_{i-1} \) from \( a_{i+1} \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It iterates through the array and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

4. **Output:**
   - After attempting to reduce the array in `func_2`, it uses `func_1` to check if the array is all zeros.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:

The logic in `func_2` is flawed. Specifically, the operation inside the while loop is incorrect. The operation should subtract 1 from \( a_{i-1} \), 2 from \( a_i \), and 1 from \( a_{i+1} \), not multiply and subtract as currently implemented.

Here is the problematic part of `func_2`:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```
This should be:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect due to the improper implementation of the operation inside the while loop in `func_2`. Correcting this would involve changing the operation to properly subtract 1, 2, and 1 from the respective elements.

**Correctness: **False**
