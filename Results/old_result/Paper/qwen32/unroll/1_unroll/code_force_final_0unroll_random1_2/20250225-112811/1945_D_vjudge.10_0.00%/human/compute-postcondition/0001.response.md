The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list named `custos`. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` is an input integer; `custos` is an empty list.**
