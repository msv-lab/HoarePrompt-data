The code snippet initializes a list `cnt_b` with 1000001 elements, all set to 0. This list is used to count occurrences of elements in the list `b` up to the value of `max_val` which is 1000000. 

The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code snippet. The `max_val` remains 1000000.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Similarly, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `max_val` is 1000000. `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, all initialized to 0.**
