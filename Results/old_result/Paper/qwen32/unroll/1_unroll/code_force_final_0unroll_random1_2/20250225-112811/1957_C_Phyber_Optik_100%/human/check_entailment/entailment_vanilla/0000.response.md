Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players place rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - You (the player) and the computer alternate turns.
   - You start first, placing a white rook, then the computer places a black rook.
   - Rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - If you place a rook at (r, c), the computer places a rook at (c, r).
   - If r = c, the computer skips its turn.
   - The game continues until no more valid moves are possible.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of possible final configurations of the board after k moves by you and the implied k moves by the computer.
   - Output the result modulo \(10^9+7\).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The game is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal (r = c).
   - The number of valid configurations depends on the number of unoccupied rows and columns.
   - The number of unoccupied rows and columns after k moves is \(n - 2k\) if no moves were on the main diagonal, and may be less if moves were on the main diagonal.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with size 300007, which is sufficient given the problem constraints.
   - The function `func_1` is called to populate this DP array.

2. **DP Array Calculation**:
   - The DP array is used to store the number of possible configurations for a given number of unoccupied rows and columns.
   - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, which correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in a symmetric manner.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size \(n\) and the number of moves \(k\).
   - It reads the k moves and marks the rows and columns as invalid using a set `invalid`.
   - The number of valid configurations is then determined by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining unoccupied rows and columns.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Invalid Rows and Columns**:
   - The program incorrectly adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set for each move. This does not account for the fact that if `r == c`, the computer does not make a move.
   - The program should only add `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set if `r != c`. If `r == c`, only one of them should be added, or none should be added since the computer skips its turn.

2. **Handling of Main Diagonal Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly handle moves on the main diagonal (r = c). It should account for these moves separately to avoid over-counting or under-counting.

### Conclusion

The program has a critical flaw in how it handles moves on the main diagonal and the calculation of invalid rows and columns. This results in incorrect counts of valid configurations.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
