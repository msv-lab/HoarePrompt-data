### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine whether the shape formed by '1's in a given grid is a square or a triangle. However, the logic implemented in the code is flawed and does not correctly identify the shapes as described in the problem statement.

Here are the key issues with the program:
1. **Triangle Detection**: The program does not correctly check for the properties of a triangle. A triangle (either upright or upside-down) has rows with an odd number of '1's that form a pattern of increasing and then decreasing odd numbers, centered around a single column. The program only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle.
2. **Square Detection**: The program does check for squares correctly by comparing the number of '1's in the first two rows. However, this is only valid if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not the only condition for a square. The program does not ensure that all rows have the same number of '1's and that they are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct as it does not accurately determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the provided criteria.

**Correctness: False**
