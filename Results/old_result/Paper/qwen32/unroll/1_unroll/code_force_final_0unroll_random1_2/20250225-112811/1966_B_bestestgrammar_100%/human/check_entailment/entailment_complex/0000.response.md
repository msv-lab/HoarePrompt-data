### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. The key logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Check if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color (`gr[0][0] == gr[n-1][m-1]`)**:
   - If they are the same, the program outputs "YES" because it's trivially possible to make the entire grid that color by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners.
   
2. **If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different (`gr[0][0] != gr[n-1][m-1]`)**:
   - The program checks for the presence of at least one pair of adjacent cells in the top row or the bottom row that have different colors.
   - It also checks for the presence of at least one pair of adjacent cells in the first column or the last column that have different colors.
   - If either of these conditions is met, the program outputs "YES" because it's possible to use these adjacent cells to change the colors of the grid.
   - If neither condition is met (i.e., all cells in the top and bottom rows are the same, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same), the program outputs "NO" because it's impossible to change the colors of the grid to make all squares the same color.

### Analysis:

The logic in the program is sound and aligns with the problem description. The program correctly identifies scenarios where it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color (when the top-left and bottom-right corners are different and there are no adjacent differing cells in the top/bottom rows or first/last columns).

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Correctness: **True**
