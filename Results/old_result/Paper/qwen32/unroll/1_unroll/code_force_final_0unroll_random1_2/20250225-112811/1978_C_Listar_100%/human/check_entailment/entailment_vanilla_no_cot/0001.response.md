To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem description and example cases.

### Problem Analysis

The program aims to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that its Manhattan value is equal to `k`. The Manhattan value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element in the permutation and its corresponding index (1-based).

### Key Points to Check

1. **Permutation Validity**: The output must be a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
2. **Manhattan Value Calculation**: The Manhattan value of the output permutation should match the given `k`.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program must handle cases where no permutation exists that satisfies the condition.
4. **Efficiency**: The program should handle the upper limits of `n` and `k` efficiently.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_4`**:
   - Reads input values `n` and `k`.
   - Checks if `k` is odd. If yes, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Constructs a permutation `l` from 1 to `n`.
   - Iteratively attempts to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k`.
   - Uses helper functions `func_2` and `func_3` to manipulate the permutation.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Swaps specific elements in the permutation based on the current count `c` and remaining `k`.
   - This function is intended to adjust the Manhattan value by swapping elements.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Swaps the `c`-th element from the start with the `c`-th element from the end.
   - This function is used to manipulate the permutation structure.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - Prints "YES" and the permutation if a valid permutation is found.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - Orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - Calls `func_1` to generate a permutation if possible.
   - Calls `func_5` to print the result.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1: `n=3, k=4`**
   - The program should output "YES" followed by a permutation like `[3, 1, 2]`.
   - The Manhattan value is `|3-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

2. **Test Case 2: `n=4, k=5`**
   - The program should output "NO" as no permutation exists with a Manhattan value of 5.

3. **Test Case 3: `n=7, k=0`**
   - The program should output "YES" followed by a permutation like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
   - The Manhattan value is `|1-1| + |2-2| + |3-3| + |4-4| + |5-5| + |6-6| + |7-7| = 0`.

4. **Test Case 4: `n=1, k=1000000000000`**
   - The program should output "NO" as no permutation exists with a Manhattan value of 1000000000000 for `n=1`.

5. **Test Case 5: `n=8, k=14`**
   - The program should output "YES" followed by a valid permutation.
   - The Manhattan value should be 14.

6. **Test Case 6: `n=112, k=777`**
   - The program should output "YES" followed by a valid permutation.
   - The Manhattan value should be 777.

7. **Test Case 7: `n=5, k=12`**
   - The program should output "NO" as no permutation exists with a Manhattan value of 12.

8. **Test Case 8: `n=5, k=2`**
   - The program should output "YES" followed by a valid permutation.
   - The Manhattan value should be 2.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to handle the provided examples correctly. It correctly identifies cases where no permutation exists and generates valid permutations when possible. The logic for adjusting the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value seems to be implemented correctly.

**Correctness: True**
