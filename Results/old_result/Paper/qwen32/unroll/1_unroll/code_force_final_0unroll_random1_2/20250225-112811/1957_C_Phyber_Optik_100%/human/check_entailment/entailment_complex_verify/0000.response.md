### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code systematically:

1. **Initialization of `dp` array**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a length of 300007, which is sufficient given the constraints (n ≤ 3 · 10^5).
   - The function `func_1` is defined below the main part of the code and computes the values for the `dp` array correctly using the given formula. The `NameError` mentioned in the original assessment is incorrect since `func_1` is defined.

2. **Incorrect logic for `invalid` set**:
   - The `invalid` set is used to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. The current code adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set. This logic is correct because if a rook is placed at `(r, c)`, both row `r` and column `c` are occupied and cannot be used again. The original assessment incorrectly assumes that rows and columns need to be tracked separately, which is not necessary here.

3. **Incorrect calculation of possible configurations**:
   - The program calculates the number of possible configurations using the `dp` array. The `dp` array is supposed to store the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board with `i` rooks already placed. The logic used here is correct based on the provided formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This formula accounts for the constraints of the problem, including the computer's mirroring moves.

4. **Handling of the special case when `r == c`**:
   - The problem description mentions that if `r == c`, the computer skips its turn. The current code does not explicitly handle this case because the `invalid` set already accounts for it. When `r == c`, both `r` and `c` are added to the `invalid` set, effectively skipping the computer's turn. The original assessment incorrectly states that this special case is not handled correctly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly initializes the `dp` array, uses the `invalid` set correctly to track occupied rows and columns, calculates the number of possible configurations accurately, and correctly handles the special case when `r == c`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
