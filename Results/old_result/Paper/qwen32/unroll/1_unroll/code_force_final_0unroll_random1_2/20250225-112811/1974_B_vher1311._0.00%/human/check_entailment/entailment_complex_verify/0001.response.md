### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems systematically:

1. **Unique Characters Extraction and Sorting:**
   ```python
   unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
   ```
   This line correctly identifies all unique characters in the string `s` and sorts them alphabetically. This part is accurate.

2. **Symmetric Replacement Logic:**
   ```python
   (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)
   for char in s:
       if char in unique_chars:
           s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
           j -= 1
       else:
           unique_chars.insert(i, char)
           i += 1
           j += 1
   return ''.join(unique_chars)
   ```
   - **String Immutability:** The code attempts to modify the string `s` in place using `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])`. This is incorrect because strings in Python are immutable, and `s.replace` returns a new string rather than modifying the original one.
   - **Incorrect Replacement Logic:** The logic for replacing characters is flawed. It attempts to replace each character in `s` with the corresponding symmetric character from `unique_chars`, but it does so in an inefficient and incorrect manner. The `s.replace` operation replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` with `unique_chars[j]`, which is not the intended behavior. Instead, it should only replace the current occurrence of `char` in the iteration.
   - **Unnecessary `else` Block:** The `else` block is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that all characters in the encoded string `b` are part of the sorted list of unique characters. Thus, the `else` block will never execute and is incorrect for this problem.
   - **Incorrect Return Value:** The function returns the list of unique characters joined into a string, which is not the decoded string. The decoded string should be constructed by mapping each character in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string, the program should:
1. **Extract and Sort Unique Characters:** Identify all unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sort them alphabetically.
2. **Create Symmetric Mapping:** Create a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters to its symmetric counterpart.
3. **Transform Encoded String:** Use this mapping to transform the encoded string `b` back into the original string `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(b):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(char_map[char] for char in b)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The original assessment correctly identifies these problems.

### Final: **False**
