To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to systematically analyze the code and compare it with the problem requirements and the function summaries.

### Analysis of the Code

#### Function `func_4`
- **Input Handling**: Retrieves `n` and `k` from the input.
- **Odd `k` Check**: If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value is always even.
- **Maximum `k` Calculation**: Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`:
  - For odd `n`: `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`
  - For even `n`: `max_k = n^2 // 2`
- **Validation**: If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Initial Permutation**: Starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- **Loop**: Iterates through the permutation in reverse order, adjusting elements to increase the Manhattan value.
- **Helper Functions**: Uses `func_2` and `func_3` to swap elements and adjust the permutation.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Swapping Logic**: Swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `-c - k` to increase the Manhattan value by a specific amount `k`.

#### Function `func_3`
- **Swapping Logic**: Swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `c - 1` to adjust the permutation.

### Verification of the Program

1. **Even `k` Check**: The program correctly handles the case where `k` is odd by returning `(0, 0)`.
2. **Maximum `k` Check**: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` and returns `(0, 0)` if `k` exceeds `max_k`.
3. **Permutation Construction**: The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is designed to construct a permutation with the specified Manhattan value `k`. However, the complexity of these functions and the specific swapping logic need to be verified against edge cases and typical scenarios.

### Edge Case Analysis

Let's consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- **Test Case**: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
- **Expected Output**: A permutation with a Manhattan value of 2, such as `[2, 1, 3]`.

Let's manually verify if the program can produce a valid permutation for this case.

#### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initial Permutation**: `[1, 2, 3]`
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - `i = 3`: `k = 2 // 2 = 1`
     - `c = 1`
     - `k = 1 < 3 - 1 = 2`, so `k = 1` is less than `i - 1`.
     - Calls `func_2(c, k, l)`:
       - Swaps `l[-1]` with `l[-1 - 1]` (i.e., `3` with `2`), resulting in `[1, 3, 2]`.
     - `k = 1 - 3 + 1 = -1`, which is less than 0, so the loop terminates.
3. **Output**: `[1, 3, 2]` has a Manhattan value of `|1 - 1| + |3 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`.

The program successfully constructs a valid permutation for `n = 3` and `k = 2`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the manual verification of the test case, the program appears to handle the specified cases correctly. The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` seems to be designed to construct a permutation with the specified Manhattan value `k` when possible.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is likely inaccurate.

**Final: True**
