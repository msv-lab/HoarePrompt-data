### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to maximize the score by performing exactly `n` moves, where each move involves selecting two integers from the whiteboard, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both integers from the board. The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available integers together. This is because adding the smaller of two numbers to the score will yield the maximum possible score when considering all pairs.

The provided program follows this optimal strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It then sums up the first `n` elements of the sorted list (which are the smallest `n` integers).
5. It prints the resulting score for each test case.

By sorting the list and summing the smallest `n` integers, the program ensures that it is always adding the smallest available integers to the score, thus maximizing the score as required by the problem statement.
