### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by counting unique elements and their bitwise complements. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The function is trying to pair each number with its bitwise complement (i.e., a number `x` such that `x ^ y = 2^31 - 1`), but the implementation is incorrect.

Here are the issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Bitwise Complement Calculation**: The code uses `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` to calculate the bitwise complement. This is not the correct way to find the bitwise complement for a 31-bit number. The correct way to find the bitwise complement of a 31-bit number `num` is to use `num ^ ((1 << 31) - 1)`. However, the code provided uses the same expression, which is not the problem here, but the logic of counting is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The code is supposed to count the number of groups required, but it incorrectly counts the number of unique elements that do not have a corresponding bitwise complement. The correct approach is to count the number of unique sets of numbers that cannot be paired with their bitwise complements.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The code increments `res` every time it encounters a number that does not have a corresponding complement in the `count` dictionary. However, this does not correctly represent the number of groups required. Instead, it should be counting the number of unique sets of numbers that cannot be paired.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the number of unique sets of numbers that cannot be paired with their bitwise complements. This can be done by using a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen and their complements.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    seen = set()
    res = 0
    for num in a:
        complement = num ^ ((1 << 31) - 1)
        if complement in seen:
            seen.remove(complement)
        else:
            seen.add(num)
            res += 1
    return res
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the provided code, the original implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
