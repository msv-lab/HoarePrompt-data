The code provided prompts the user to enter the number of test cases and assigns this input to the variable `t` after converting it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
