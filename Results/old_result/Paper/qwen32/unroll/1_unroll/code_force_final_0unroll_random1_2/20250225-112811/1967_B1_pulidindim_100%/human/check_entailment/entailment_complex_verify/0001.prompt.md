You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. Additionally, the sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: After executing all iterations, `t` test cases will be processed, and for each test case, the final value of `ans` will be printed. The variables `n`, `m`, `count`, and `g` will not retain their values after each iteration of the outer loop as they are recalculated or reinitialized within each loop. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it only dictates the number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, performs a series of calculations, and prints a result based on these values. The function processes each test case independently and does not retain any state between them.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

### Program Analysis
The given program seems to attempt to solve the problem in a loop over possible values of `b` (denoted as `count` in the program). Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
   - `count` is initialized to 2 (since `b` starts from 1, and the loop starts from 2).
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` (since every pair (a, 1) is valid because gcd(a, 1) = 1 and a + 1 is always a multiple of 1).

2. **Loop over `b`**:
   - The loop runs while `count` (representing `b`) is less than or equal to `m`.
   - `countmins` is calculated as `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n // count` (integer division).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks (this is a condition to stop further iterations).
   - `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
   - `ans` is incremented by `g // count + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the final value of `ans` is printed.

### Issues in the Program
The logic of the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The key issue is in the way `g` is calculated and used to update `ans`. The program does not correctly check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair (a, b).

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a correct approach:

1. Iterate over all `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

This approach is computationally expensive for large `n` and `m` but is necessary to ensure correctness.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
