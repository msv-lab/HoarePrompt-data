The function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters. If `space` is True, it splits the line into substrings separated by spaces; if `space` is False, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, it converts each element in the resulting list to an integer. The function returns a list of integers if `to_int` is True, or a list of strings (substrings or characters) if `to_int` is False.
