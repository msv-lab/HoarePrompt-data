Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) a binary string can be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:

1. **Sorted Binary String**: A binary string is sorted if all '0's appear before all '1's.
2. **Cutting Criteria**: To achieve a sorted binary string, we need to identify transitions between '1's and '0's. Specifically, a cut is needed whenever a '1' is followed by a '0' because these two characters cannot be rearranged into a sorted order without cutting.
3. **Counting Cuts**: 
   - Count the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' (let's call this `cut1`).
   - Count the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' (let's call this `cut0`).
4. **Determining Minimum Pieces**:
   - If there are no '0' followed by '1' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), it means the string is already sorted or starts with '1's and ends with '0's, so we need `cut1 + 1` pieces (the +1 accounts for the initial segment).
   - If there are '0' followed by '1' transitions (`cut0 != 0`), then the minimum number of pieces required is `cut0 + cut1`.

### Program Analysis:

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
```

- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the binary string `a`.
- It initializes `cut0` and `cut1` to 0.
- It iterates through the string to count transitions:
  - `cut1` is incremented when a '1' is followed by a '0'.
  - `cut0` is incremented when a '0' is followed by a '1'.
- It then decides the number of pieces based on the conditions derived from the observations:
  - If `cut0` is 0, it outputs `cut1 + 1`.
  - Otherwise, it outputs `cut0 + cut1`.

### Conclusion:

The logic in the program aligns with the problem's requirements and correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted one.

**Correctness: True**
