The code appends a new value to the list `ans`. The new value is calculated as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. Given the initial state, `ans` is `[2]`, so `sum(ans)` is `2`. The new value to be appended is `k - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `k - 3`.

Thus, the new state of `ans` will be `[2, k - 3]`.

Output State: **`ans` is `[2, k - 3]`**
