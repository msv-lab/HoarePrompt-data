Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by precomputing the number of possible final configurations for chessboards of different sizes using dynamic programming. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of possible configurations for chessboards of size `i`. The array is initialized with a size of 300,007 to accommodate the maximum possible value of `n` (300,000) plus some buffer.
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the values of `dp` for all sizes from 1 to `n` using the given recurrence relation:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place rooks on a 1x1 board.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board.
     - For `i >= 3`, `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`: This formula accounts for the different ways to place rooks on larger boards, considering the constraints of the game.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The `func_1(300000)` call ensures that the `dp` array is precomputed for all possible board sizes up to 300,000 before processing any test cases. This precomputation allows for efficient lookups during the test case processing.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, adding the row and column indices to the `invalid` set. This set keeps track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The number of remaining valid rows and columns is `n - len(invalid)`. The program then uses the precomputed `dp` array to determine the number of possible final configurations for this remaining size, ensuring the result is modulo `1000000007`.
   - The `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` ensures that there is at least one possible configuration even if `dp[n - len(invalid)]` is less than 1 (which shouldn't happen given the problem constraints and the way `dp` is computed).

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly precomputes the number of configurations for all possible board sizes using the given recurrence relation.
   - It efficiently processes each test case by leveraging the precomputed `dp` values, ensuring that the solution is both correct and efficient.
   - The use of modulo `1000000007` ensures that the results fit within the required constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
