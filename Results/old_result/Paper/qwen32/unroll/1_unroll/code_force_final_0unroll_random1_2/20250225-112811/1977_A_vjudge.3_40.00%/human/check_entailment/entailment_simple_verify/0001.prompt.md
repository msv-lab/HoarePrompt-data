You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: A series of 'Yes' or 'No' messages printed for each iteration based on the input pairs (n, m).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given code to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from 0 cubes.

### Key Observations:

1. **Parity of Moves and Result:**
   - If `n` (number of moves) is even, then the final number of cubes `m` must also be even. This is because each pair of moves (add and remove) results in no net change in the number of cubes, or two adds result in an even increase, or two removes result in an even decrease.
   - If `n` is odd, then the final number of cubes `m` must also be odd. This is because an odd number of moves will result in either an odd increase (if more adds than removes) or an odd decrease (if more removes than adds).

2. **Range of Possible Values:**
   - The minimum number of cubes after `n` moves is `0` (if all moves are removes and we start from 0).
   - The maximum number of cubes after `n` moves is `n` (if all moves are adds).

### Code Analysis:

Let's break down the code to see if it aligns with the above observations:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- The code correctly handles the case where `n == m` (direct match).
- It correctly handles the case where `m > n` (impossible to have more cubes than moves).
- It correctly handles the case where `m == n - 1` (possible if the last move is a remove after `n` adds).
- The code then checks the parity of `m` and `n`:
  - If both are even, it prints 'Yes'.
  - If both are odd, it prints 'Yes'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Code:

- **Missing Parity Check for `m < n - 1`:** The code doesn't handle cases where `m < n - 1` and the parity matches. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, the code will incorrectly print 'No' because it doesn't consider the possibility of reaching `m` through a combination of adds and removes that results in the correct parity.

### Conclusion:

The code fails to correctly handle all possible cases, specifically cases where `m < n - 1` and the parity of `m` and `n` matches. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
