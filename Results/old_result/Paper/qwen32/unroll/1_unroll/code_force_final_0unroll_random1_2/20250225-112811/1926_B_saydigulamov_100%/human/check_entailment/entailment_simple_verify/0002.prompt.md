You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of lists containing only the characters '0' or '1'. Each grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: the loop will print 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each of the `a` iterations, and `t`, `n`, and the grid will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Processing Each Grid:**
   - For each grid, it initializes an empty list `k`.
   - It then iterates through each row `b` of the grid.
   - If the row contains '1's, it counts the number of '1's in that row and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determine Shape:**
   - After processing all rows of a grid, it checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Issues:
- The logic to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle is flawed.
  - A square should have all rows with the same number of '1's.
  - A triangle (upside down or not) does not necessarily have the first two rows with the same number of '1's. For example, in a triangle with k=4, the number of '1's in each row would be 1, 3, 5, 7, which are not equal.
- The code does not correctly identify the pattern of '1's for a triangle.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
