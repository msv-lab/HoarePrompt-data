To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop and understand how it processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`, and then performs the following conditional checks:

1. If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`.
2. Else if `A % 2 == 0`, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
3. Otherwise, it computes `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the output of each test case is printed immediately, the state of variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state remains unchanged after the loop completes. The only changes occur in the variables `A`, `B`, and `C` within the loop, but these are local to each iteration and do not affect the initial state variables.

Thus, the output state is the same as the initial state for the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. The output of the loop itself is a series of printed values based on the conditions specified, but these are not stored in any variables affecting the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.**
