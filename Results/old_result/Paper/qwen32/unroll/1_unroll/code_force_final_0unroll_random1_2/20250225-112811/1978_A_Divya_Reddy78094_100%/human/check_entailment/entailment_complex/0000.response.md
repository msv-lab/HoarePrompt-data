### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem by dividing the books into two piles and maximizing the total number of pages Alice can read by taking the highest number book from each pile. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly achieve this goal.

The current implementation calculates the sum of the maximum value from all elements except the last one in the list and the last element itself. This approach does not guarantee that the highest number book from each pile is chosen, as it does not consider all possible ways to divide the books into two piles.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the list of books in descending order.
2. Select the two highest numbers from the sorted list, as these would represent the highest number books from two different piles.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the list in descending order
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # The sum of the two highest numbers
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
