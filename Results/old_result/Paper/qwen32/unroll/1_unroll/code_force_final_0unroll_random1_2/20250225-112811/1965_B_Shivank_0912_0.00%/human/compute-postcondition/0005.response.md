Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of cases, and `cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each case, the function returns a tuple `(25, sequence)`, where `sequence` is a list of the first 25 powers of 2 starting from 2^0 up to 2^24. This is done for each tuple in the `cases` list, and the function returns a list of these tuples.**
