You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine if the given program is correct based on the provided problem description:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each with one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - He has `n` problems in his bank, each with a given difficulty level.
   - He needs to determine the minimum number of additional problems he needs to create such that he can hold `m` rounds.

2. **Approach**:
   - For each test case, we need to count the number of problems of each difficulty level in the bank.
   - We then need to check if there are enough problems of each level to cover `m` rounds.
   - For each difficulty level that does not have enough problems, we calculate how many more problems are needed and sum these values to get the total number of additional problems required.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The code initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (for 'A' to 'G').
   - It then iterates over the string `a` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level and stores these counts in `freq`.
   - It calculates the missing problems for each difficulty level by computing `max(0, m - f)` where `f` is the count of problems of that difficulty level.
   - It sums up these missing values to determine the total number of additional problems needed.

4. **Code Review**:
   - The code correctly initializes the frequency array and counts the occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - It correctly calculates the missing problems for each difficulty level and sums these values.
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and returns the correct results.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the code with the provided example:
     - For the first test case (`10 1 BGECDCBDED`), the code correctly identifies that 2 more problems are needed (one 'A' and one 'F').
     - For the second test case (`10 2 BGECDCBDED`), the code correctly identifies that 5 more problems are needed.
     - For the third test case (`9 1 BBCDEFFGG`), the code correctly identifies that 1 more problem is needed (one 'A').

Based on this reasoning and verification, the code appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
