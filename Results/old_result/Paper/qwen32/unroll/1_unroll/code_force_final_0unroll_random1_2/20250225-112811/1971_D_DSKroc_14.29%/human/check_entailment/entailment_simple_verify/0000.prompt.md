You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)
        
    #State: a series of integers, each representing the number of segments in the respective binary string for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. Here's why:

1. **Logic**: The core logic of the code is to count the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in the string. Each such transition indicates a point where a cut is necessary to ensure that all '0's can be moved to the left of all '1's when rearranging.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
   - It then iterates through the string and counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'.
   - The minimum number of pieces required is `count + 1`, where `count` is the number of transitions from '1' to '0'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Transitions**: If the string is already sorted (all '0's before all '1's), there are no transitions, and the program correctly returns 1.
   - **Single Character**: If the string has only one character, it is trivially sorted, and the program returns 1.
   - **All '0's or All '1's**: These are special cases of already sorted strings, and the program correctly returns 1.
   - **Alternating Characters**: For strings like "010101", the program correctly counts the number of transitions and returns the appropriate number of pieces.

4. **Verification Against Examples**:
   - For the input "11010", the transitions are from the first '1' to the '0', the second '1' to the '0', and the third '1' to the last '0'. This results in 3 cuts + 1 piece = 4 pieces, but since the last piece is not counted in the transitions, it correctly returns 3.
   - For the input "00000000", there are no transitions, so the program returns 1.
   - For the input "1", there are no transitions, so the program returns 1.
   - For the input "10", there is one transition, so the program returns 2.
   - For the input "0001111", there are no transitions, so the program returns 1.
   - For the input "0110", there is one transition, so the program returns 2.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly handle all edge cases and examples provided in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
