Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Calls and Variable Scopes:**
   - The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the list `a` or the list `ops` as arguments. This will result in a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - The function `func_1` attempts to modify the list `a` and append to the list `ops`, but these variables are not passed as arguments to `func_1` and are not defined within its scope.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to recursively set the elements of the array to the MEX of the subarray and record the operations. However, the logic is flawed:
     - If `l == r`, it incorrectly sets `a[l]` to 0 instead of the MEX.
     - The recursive call to `func_1` and the subsequent operations do not correctly compute the MEX and set the elements of the array.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is supposed to recursively split the array and compute the MEX for subarrays, but it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the operations:
     - The MEX is not computed correctly; it simply checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the length of the subarray, which is not the correct condition for setting the subarray to the MEX.
     - The operations are not recorded correctly, and the array is not modified as intended.

4. **Incorrect Output Handling:**
   - The function `func_3` correctly reads the input and calls `func_2` to get the sum, number of operations, and the operations themselves. However, since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` are incorrect, the output will not be correct.

### Example Case:
Let's consider the input:
```
2
0 1
```
- The correct output should be:
  ```
  4 1
  1 2
  ```
- However, the provided program will not produce this output due to the issues mentioned above. It will likely result in an error or incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
