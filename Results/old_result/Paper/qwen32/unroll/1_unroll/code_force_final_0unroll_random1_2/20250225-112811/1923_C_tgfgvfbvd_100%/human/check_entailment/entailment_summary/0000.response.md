### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining if a subarray is "good" based on the provided conditions. The conditions are:
1. The sum of the elements in the subarray \( c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, \dots, c_{r_i} \) must be equal to the sum of the elements in another array \( b \) of the same length.
2. Each element in the subarray \( c \) must be different from the corresponding element in \( b \).
3. Each element in \( b \) must be greater than 0.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
- Precomputing prefix sums and the count of 1s in the array.
- For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray and the count of 1s within that subarray.
- It then checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array \( b \) satisfying the conditions:
  - The sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray should be greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray. This is because each 1 in the subarray can only be incremented to 2 at minimum, and other elements can be incremented to any value greater than their current value, but the total sum must still match.
  - The subarray must have more than one element (i.e., \( b - a + 1 > 1 \)) to allow for the transformation.

Let's analyze the program's logic:
- The prefix sum array `p` helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.
- The count of 1s array `c` helps in quickly calculating the number of 1s in any subarray.
- The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element, which is necessary for the transformation.
- The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray can be adjusted by incrementing the elements to form another array \( b \) with the required properties.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem's conditions.

### Correctness: **True**
