You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9, visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients, and tot and bipartite are variables used to keep track of the total and bipartiteness during the DFS traversal respectively.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is the first integer from each line of input, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is the second integer from each line of input, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is the third integer from each line of input, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` and `bipartite` are variables used to keep track of the total and bipartiteness during the DFS traversal respectively.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating which nodes have been visited, `coef` is a list of integers where each element is 1 if it was the starting point of a new component, `tot` is the final value after all DFS traversals, `bipartite` is the final value after all DFS traversals, `ok` is True if at least one bipartite component with a non-zero `tot` was found.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating which nodes have been visited, `coef` is a list of integers where each element is 1 if it was the starting point of a new component, `tot` is the final value after all DFS traversals, `bipartite` is the final value after all DFS traversals, and `ok` is a boolean indicating whether at least one bipartite component with a non-zero `tot` was found. If `ok` is True, at least one such component was found; otherwise, no such component was found.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a graph represented by disks (circles) defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`). It uses the `visited` list to keep track of visited nodes, the `coef` list to store coefficients, and the `tot` and `bipartite` variables to maintain information about the total count and bipartiteness during the traversal. The function does not explicitly return any value but modifies the `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite` variables as part of its operation.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
