Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, all initialized to 0. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `ans`, `curr`, `i`) do not retain their values after the loop finishes as they are local to each iteration of the outer loop.**
