The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common placeholder for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
