Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `r`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, then the current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called, but the values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, and `pos` themselves are not changed by this function call in the provided context. The function call does not return a value or modify the variables directly. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the additional information that the function has been called.
