You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: For each test case, the variable `ans` will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `ans` is 'YES' if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color, or if there is at least one adjacent pair of cells in the top row or the bottom row that have different colors, or at least one adjacent pair of cells in the first and last columns that have different colors. The variable `ans` is 'NO' if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are different colors and all cells in the top row and bottom row are the same color, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same color. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `gr` will be in their final states after processing all test cases, where `t` will be 0 (as all test cases have been processed), `n` and `m` will be the dimensions of the last test case, and `gr` will be the grid of the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each grid, it determines if it's possible to change the color of some cells such that the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, either directly or by ensuring that there is at least one pair of adjacent cells in the top or bottom row with different colors, or at least one pair of adjacent cells in the first or last column with different colors. The function outputs 'YES' if such a configuration is possible and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Summary
We are given a grid of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) squares. In one operation, we can select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color. The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.

### Key Observations
1. **Single Color Grid**: If the grid already has all squares of the same color, the answer is "YES".
2. **Corner Colors**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are of the same color, then it is always possible to make the entire grid that color. This is because we can always find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right by flipping subrectangles of the same color.
3. **Border Consistency**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, we need to ensure that the entire top row and the entire bottom row are consistent (i.e., all squares in these rows are the same color) and the entire left column and the entire right column are consistent. If both the top and bottom rows are consistent and the left and right columns are consistent, then it is possible to flip the entire grid to one color.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself.
2. **Initial Answer**: Initializes the answer to "YES".
3. **Corner Check**: Checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
   - If they are different, it checks if the top row and bottom row are consistent (i.e., all squares in these rows are the same color).
   - It also checks if the left column and right column are consistent (i.e., all squares in these columns are the same color).
   - If either the top/bottom rows or left/right columns are not consistent, it sets the answer to "NO".
4. **Output**: Prints the answer for each test case.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify the logic:
- If the corners are the same, the answer is correctly set to "YES".
- If the corners are different, the program checks the consistency of the top/bottom rows and left/right columns. If any of these are inconsistent, it correctly sets the answer to "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the grid can be made uniform in color based on the given operations.

### Conclusion
The program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
