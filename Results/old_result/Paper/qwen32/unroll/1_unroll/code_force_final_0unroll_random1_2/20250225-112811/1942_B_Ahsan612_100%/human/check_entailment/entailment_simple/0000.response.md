### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` using the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The code iterates through the array `a` from the end to the beginning, calculating `res[i]` (which corresponds to `p_i`) as `mex - ar[i]`. Here, `mex` is initially set to `n` and is updated to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the iteration.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The `mex` variable is not correctly maintained as the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the constructed part of `p` up to that point. Instead, it is simply decremented based on the value of `ar[i]`, which does not guarantee that the `mex` is the actual minimum non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

2. **Handling of Negative Values in `a`**: The code does not handle cases where `ar[i]` is negative in a way that ensures the correct `mex` is used. Specifically, if `ar[i]` is negative, `mex - ar[i]` could result in a value greater than `mex`, which is not valid for `p_i`.

3. **Efficiency Concerns**: The code does not efficiently track which numbers have been used in `p`, which is necessary to correctly compute the `mex` at each step.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the `mex` is correctly computed at each step by keeping track of which numbers have been used in `p` so far. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = [False] * n
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while used[mex]:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used[res[i]] = True
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We maintain a `used` list to keep track of which numbers have been used in `p`.
- We compute the `mex` by incrementing it until we find a number that has not been used.
- We then set `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` and mark `res[i]` as used.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original code does not correctly compute the `mex` and does not handle negative values in `a` appropriately, leading to incorrect results. The provided reasoning and code need to be corrected as shown above.
