Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The program checks several conditions to determine the output:

1. If `n` equals `m`, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to get exactly `m` cubes.

2. If `m` is greater than `n`, it prints 'No'. This is also correct because Nikita can't have more cubes than the number of moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.

3. If `m` is exactly one less than `n`, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because Nikita can make `m` moves to add cubes and one move to remove one cube, ending up with `m` cubes.

4. If both `m` and `n` are either even or odd, it prints 'Yes'. This is the most complex condition. If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because the difference `n - m` must be even, meaning that Nikita can make a series of moves that result in the correct number of cubes. For example, if `n` is 5 and `m` is 3, the difference is 2, which is even, and Nikita can achieve this by adding 3 cubes and removing 2.

5. If `m` and `n` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd), it prints 'No'. This is correct because if the difference `n - m` is odd, there's no way to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, as each move changes the parity of the number of cubes.

The program covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
