To determine the output state, we need to consider the two possible scenarios based on the value of `k`.

**Scenario 1: `k` equals 1**
- `ans` is set to `[2, 3, 4, 8]`.
- `n` is set to 10, but this does not affect the `ans` list.
- `b` is '1010', but this does not affect the `ans` list.
- `l` is 4, but this does not affect the `ans` list.
- The function returns the string `' '.join(map(str, ans))`, which is `'2 3 4 8'`.

**Scenario 2: `k` does not equal 1**
- `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, but it is not used in the definition of `ans`.
- `ans` is set to `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.
- The function returns the string `' '.join(map(str, ans))`, which depends on the value of `k`.

Since the initial state specifies that if `k` equals 1, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, we can directly use this information for the output.

Output State: **The program returns '2 3 4 8'**
