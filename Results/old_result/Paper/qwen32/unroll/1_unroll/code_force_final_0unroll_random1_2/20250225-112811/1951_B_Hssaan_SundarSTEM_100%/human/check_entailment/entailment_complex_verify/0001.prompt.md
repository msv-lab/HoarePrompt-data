You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it computes and prints the maximum number of elements that can be moved to the beginning of the list while maintaining a non-decreasing order, considering two specific scenarios involving the element at index `k-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided Python program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Tournament Structure**: 
   - There are `n` cows, each with a unique Cowdeforces rating.
   - The tournament consists of `n-1` matches.
   - The first match is between the cow in position 1 and position 2.
   - Subsequent matches are between the cow in position `i+1` and the winner of match `i-1`.
   - The cow with the higher rating wins each match.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win.
   - You can swap cow `k` with another cow exactly once or choose not to swap.

3. **Approach**:
   - Evaluate the maximum wins if cow `k` does not swap.
   - Evaluate the maximum wins if cow `k` swaps with each other cow.
   - Choose the scenario with the maximum wins.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Initial Swap**:
   - The program swaps cow `k` with the cow in position 1.
   - It then calculates how many matches cow `k` can win from position 1.
   
2. **Restoring Initial State**:
   - The program swaps cow `k` back to its original position.
   
3. **Evaluating Swaps**:
   - For each possible swap position `p` (from 1 to `n`), the program swaps cow `k` with the cow in position `p`.
   - It calculates how many matches cow `k` can win from position `p`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum wins found.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Evaluating Wins**:
   - The logic for calculating wins after each swap is flawed.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the winner of the first match is always the cow in position 1 after the initial swap.
   - It does not correctly simulate the tournament structure after each swap.

2. **Inefficient Evaluation**:
   - The program attempts to evaluate all possible swaps, which is inefficient given the constraints (`n` up to `10^5`).
   - It should focus on strategic swaps that could maximize wins, rather than evaluating all possibilities.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Wins**:
   - The logic for counting wins after a swap does not correctly account for the tournament progression.
   - It incorrectly counts wins based on the initial rating of cow `k` and does not simulate the entire tournament correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program's logic and efficiency, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
