Reasoning:  
The given problem requires finding the maximum final score by optimally performing n moves, where each move consists of choosing two integers from the list, adding the smaller one to the score, and then removing both integers from the list. The optimal strategy to achieve the maximum score is to always pair the smallest available integers together. This is because by pairing the smallest integers, we ensure that we are adding the smallest possible values to the score in each move, which maximizes the overall score.

The provided program implements this strategy correctly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score. This effectively pairs the smallest integers together, as the sorted list ensures that the smallest integers are considered first.
5. Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

Since the program correctly implements the optimal strategy by sorting the list and summing every second element, it will always produce the maximum possible score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
