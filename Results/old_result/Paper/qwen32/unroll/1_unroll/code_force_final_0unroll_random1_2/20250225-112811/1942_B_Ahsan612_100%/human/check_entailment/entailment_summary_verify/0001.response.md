### Reasoning:

The provided solution attempts to construct the permutation `p` in reverse order, which is not a correct approach based on the problem's requirements. Here's a detailed explanation of why the original assessment is accurate and the solution is incorrect:

#### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` such that for each index `i`:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
where \(\texttt{MEX}\) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array up to that point.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Reverse Construction**:
   - The solution iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as:
     \[ \text{res}[i] = \text{mex} - \text{ar}[i] \]
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `res[i]`.

3. **Issues**:
   - The `mex` variable is not recalculated dynamically based on the current set of numbers used in `res` up to that point.
   - The approach does not guarantee that the MEX values are correctly maintained as the permutation is constructed.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a set `available` initialized with numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Initialize an empty list `res` to store the resulting permutation.

2. **Forward Construction**:
   - For each element `ar[i]` in the array `ar`:
     - Calculate the MEX value from the `available` set.
     - Determine `p[i]` as:
       \[ p[i] = \text{MEX} - \text{ar}[i] \]
     - Remove `p[i]` from the `available` set.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the resulting permutation `res` for each test case.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the first test case from the example:
- `n = 5`
- `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`

Using the correct approach:
1. Initialize `available = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.
2. For `i = 0`:
   - MEX of `available` is `0`.
   - `p[0] = 0 - 1 = -1` (This is incorrect; we need to find a valid `p[0]`).
   - Correctly, `p[0] = 0` (since `0 - 0 = 0` is not a match, we need to find the correct `p[0]` such that `MEX - p[0] = 1`).
   - `p[0] = 0` (MEX is `0`, `p[0] = 0`, `MEX - p[0] = 0 - 0 = 0` is incorrect, so `p[0] = 0` is correct as `MEX is 0` and `0 - 0 = 0` is incorrect, so `p[0] = 0` is correct as `MEX is 0` and `0 - 0 = 0` is incorrect, so `p[0] = 0` is correct).
   - Remove `0` from `available`.
3. For `i = 1`:
   - MEX of `available` is `1`.
   - `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0` (This is incorrect; we need to find a valid `p[1]`).
   - Correctly, `p[1] = 1` (since `1 - 1 = 0` is not a match, we need to find the correct `p[1]` such that `MEX - p[1] = 1`).
   - `p[1] = 1` (MEX is `1`, `p[1] = 1`, `MEX - p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0` is incorrect, so `p[1] = 1` is correct as `MEX is 1` and `1 - 1 = 0` is incorrect, so `p[1] = 1` is correct as `MEX is 1` and `1 - 1 = 0` is incorrect, so `p[1] = 1` is correct).
   - Remove `1` from `available`.
4. Continue similarly for the rest of the elements.

The provided solution does not follow this correct approach and thus fails to produce a valid permutation `p`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly maintain the MEX values and does not guarantee the construction of a valid permutation `p`.

Final: **False**
