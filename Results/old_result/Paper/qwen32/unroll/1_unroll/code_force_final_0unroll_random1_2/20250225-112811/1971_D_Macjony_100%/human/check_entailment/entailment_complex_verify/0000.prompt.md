You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        print(count)
        
    #State: 2 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases, each consisting of a binary string. For each string, it calculates and prints the number of segments of consecutive identical characters, reduced by one if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program for the given problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
You need to find the minimum number of pieces you need to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this by iterating through the string and counting the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'. It then adjusts the count based on the presence of a '0' followed by a '1' transition.

Here's the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Correctness Check:
1. **Counting Transitions**: The program correctly counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1'. Each transition indicates a potential cut point.
2. **Adjusting for '01' Transitions**: The program adjusts the count by subtracting 1 if there is at least one '01' transition. This is because the first '01' transition can be used to join pieces without needing an additional cut.

### Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Input**: `11010`
   - Transitions: `1->0` (count=2), `0->1` (count=3), `1->0` (count=4)
   - '01' transition present (`flag=True`), so final count = 4 - 1 = 3
   - Expected Output: `3` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `00000000`
   - No transitions
   - Expected Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `1`
   - No transitions
   - Expected Output: `1` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `10`
   - Transitions: `1->0`
   - '01' transition present (`flag=True`), so final count = 2 - 1 = 1
   - Expected Output: `2` (Incorrect, should be `2`)

5. **Input**: `0001111`
   - No transitions
   - Expected Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Input**: `0110`
   - Transitions: `0->1` (count=2), `1->0` (count=3)
   - '01' transition present (`flag=True`), so final count = 3 - 1 = 2
   - Expected Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program seems to work correctly for the provided test cases. However, there is a subtle issue with the logic for the test case `10`, where it incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`. This is because the program subtracts 1 from the count whenever there is a '01' transition, which is not always necessary. The program should count the number of transitions directly without the adjustment.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly handles the case where there is a single '01' transition. The adjustment logic (`if flag: count -= 1`) is flawed and leads to incorrect results in some cases. The correct approach is to simply count the number of transitions between '0' and '1' without any additional adjustments.
