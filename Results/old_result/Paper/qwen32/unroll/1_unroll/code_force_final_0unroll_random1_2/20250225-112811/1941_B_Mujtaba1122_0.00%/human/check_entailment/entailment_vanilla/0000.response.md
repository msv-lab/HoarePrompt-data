Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
Rudolf wants to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n - 1 \)) and then:
- Decreasing \( a_{i-1} \) by 1.
- Decreasing \( a_i \) by 2.
- Decreasing \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.

The program needs to determine if such operations can reduce the array to all zeros.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It iterates over the array and returns `False` if any element is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the described operation.
   - It iterates over the array from the second element to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element, it enters a `while` loop that continues as long as the current element is greater than 1, and both the previous and next elements are greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop, it attempts to decrease the current element and its neighbors based on the operation described.
   - The crucial part of this function is the operations inside the `while` loop:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     This is incorrect because it does not correctly apply the operation. It should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if the array is all zeros and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Issues in the Program
- The core issue lies in the incorrect implementation of the operation inside `func_2`. The current implementation incorrectly multiplies the decrement by `list[i - 1]`, which is not how the operation is defined.
- This incorrect implementation can lead to incorrect results, as it does not properly simulate the operation described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
Given the incorrect implementation of the operation inside `func_2`, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

**Correctness: False**
