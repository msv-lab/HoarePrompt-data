You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. This is followed by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' or 'B' representing the colors of the squares in the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: For each test case, the variable `ans` will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `ans` is 'YES' if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color, or if there is at least one adjacent pair of cells in the top row or the bottom row that have different colors, or at least one adjacent pair of cells in the first and last columns that have different colors. The variable `ans` is 'NO' if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are different colors and all cells in the top row and bottom row are the same color, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same color. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `gr` will be in their final states after processing all test cases, where `t` will be 0 (as all test cases have been processed), `n` and `m` will be the dimensions of the last test case, and `gr` will be the grid of the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The function processes each grid and returns a result based on the configuration of 'W' and 'B' in the grid.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
