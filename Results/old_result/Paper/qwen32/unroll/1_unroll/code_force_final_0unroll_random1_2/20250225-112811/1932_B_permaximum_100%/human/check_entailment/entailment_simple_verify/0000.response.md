Let's analyze the provided program and its annotated version to verify its correctness against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the i-th sign must occur strictly after the (i-1)-th sign.
- We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of signs) and `a` (list of periodicities).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in `a`.
   - For each `ai`, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur:
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next occurrence is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - It updates `current_year` to this next occurrence year.
   - After processing all signs, it appends the final `current_year` to the results list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

### Annotated Code Validation:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
- The annotations state that `results` is a list of integers where each integer is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding `a_list`. This is incorrect. The program does not find the smallest year that is a multiple of all integers in `a_list`. Instead, it calculates the year in which each sign sequentially occurs.

### Evaluation of Original Assessment:
- The original assessment claims that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.
- The assessment is accurate in describing how the program processes each test case and calculates the year for each sign's occurrence.
- The assessment correctly notes that the program handles the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the given problem description and input-output examples.

Final: **True**
