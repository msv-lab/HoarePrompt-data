The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are already positive integers within the range 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and `x` and `cnt` are initialized to 1 and 0, respectively. After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `m` will be updated to the values read from the input, while `x` and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0.**
