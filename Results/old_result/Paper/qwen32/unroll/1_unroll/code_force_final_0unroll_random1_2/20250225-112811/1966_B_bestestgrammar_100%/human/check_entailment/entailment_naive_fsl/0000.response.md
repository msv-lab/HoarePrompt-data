Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations. The logic in the program is flawed and does not cover all potential cases.

The program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color. If they are not, it then checks if the first row and the last row are uniform and if the first column and the last column are uniform. If both rows and columns are uniform, it concludes that it's impossible to make the whole grid the same color, which is incorrect.

Here is a counterexample where the program would output "NO" but the correct answer should be "YES":

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
WBB
BBB
BBW
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In this grid, we can select positions (1, 2) and (3, 2) (both 'B') and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to 'B'. This will change the grid to:
```
WBB
BBB
BBB
```
Then, we can select positions (1, 1) and (3, 3) (both 'B') and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to 'B'. This will change the grid to:
```
BBB
BBB
BBB
```
Thus, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color, but the program would incorrectly output "NO" for this case.

The program needs to be more comprehensive in checking the grid's uniformity and potential transformations.
