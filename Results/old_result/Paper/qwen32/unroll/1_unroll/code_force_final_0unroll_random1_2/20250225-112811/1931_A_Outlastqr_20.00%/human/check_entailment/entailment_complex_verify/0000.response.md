### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies some issues with the provided program. Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior using the annotated version and verify if the program correctly generates the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for all valid values of `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

1. **Case 1: n > 52**
   - The formula used is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - For `n = 53`, the word is `'a' + 'zz' = 'azz'`.
   - For `n = 78`, the word is `'z' + 'zz' = 'zzz'`.
   - These results are correct as they are the smallest possible words for these sums.

2. **Case 2: 52 ≥ n > 26**
   - The formula used is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - For `n = 27`, the word is `'a' + 'a' + 'z' = 'aaz'`. However, the correct word should be `'aay'` because 'aay' is lexicographically smaller than 'aaz'.
   - For `n = 52`, the word is `'a' + 'z' + 'z' = 'azz'`. However, the correct word should be `'ayz'` because 'ayz' is lexicographically smaller than 'azz'.
   - For `n = 30`, the word is `'a' + 'c' + 'z' = 'acz'`. This is correct as it is the smallest possible word for this sum.

3. **Case 3: n ≤ 26**
   - The formula used is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - For `n = 3`, the word is `'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'`. This is correct.
   - For `n = 26`, the word is `'aa' + 'z' = 'aaz'`. This is correct.

### Testing Edge Cases

Let's test some edge cases to ensure the program works correctly:
- **n = 3**: `'aaa'` (correct)
- **n = 26**: `'aaz'` (correct)
- **n = 27**: `'aay'` (correct, but the program outputs `'aaz'`)
- **n = 52**: `'ayz'` (correct, but the program outputs `'azz'`)
- **n = 53**: `'azz'` (correct)
- **n = 78**: `'zzz'` (correct)

### Conclusion

The program does not handle some cases correctly, particularly when `n` is such that the constructed word is not the smallest possible. For example:
- For `n = 27`, the correct output should be `'aay'` instead of `'aaz'`.
- For `n = 52`, the correct output should be `'ayz'` instead of `'azz'`.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**.
