### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array after adding a permutation to it. Here's the step-by-step reasoning about the given code:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself using `func_3()`.
   - The array `arr` is then converted to a set to remove duplicates and sorted. This is done to facilitate the counting of the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The maximum element `m` in the array is found, but this variable is not used further in the code.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.
   - The code then iterates over the sorted unique elements of the array.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates the position `a` where the value `arr[i] + n` would be inserted in the sorted array using `bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)`.
   - The difference `d` between `a` and `i` is computed. This difference represents the number of elements that can be made equal to `arr[i] + k` (where `k` is a permutation value) after adding the permutation.
   - The maximum value of `d` is stored in `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, the maximum count `ans` is printed.

### Analysis:
- The code correctly identifies the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation by leveraging the properties of permutations and binary search (`bisect_left`).
- The use of `sorted(list(set(arr)))` ensures that the array is free of duplicates and sorted, which is essential for the logic of finding the maximum count of equal elements.
- The logic for calculating `d` and updating `ans` is sound, as it effectively counts the number of elements that can be transformed into the same value by adding a permutation.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the program appears to be correctly implementing the required logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
