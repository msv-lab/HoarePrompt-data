To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function `func()` correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes numbers optimally.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Bitwise XOR**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence.
   - Eve's goal is to maximize Bob's wins.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program's logic to determine Bob's wins is based on the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence:
1. **Special Case**:
   - If the counts of ones, twos, and threes are equal and odd, Bob can win once at the start because the XOR of an equal number of ones, twos, and threes (all odd counts) results in zero.
   
2. **General Case**:
   - For each type of number (ones, twos, threes, fours), Eve can remove pairs of numbers, ensuring that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - The number of pairs Eve can remove for each type is `floor(count / 2)`.
   - Bob wins each time Eve removes a pair, as the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes zero.

### Verification with Examples:
1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Special Case: `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1` is true, so `cnt += 1`.
   - No pairs can be removed, so the final `cnt` is 1.
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Special Case: `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Pairs can be removed: `floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Special Case: `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Pairs can be removed: `floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`.
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Special Case: `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Pairs can be removed: `floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`.
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Special Case: `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1` is false.
   - Pairs can be removed: `floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.
   - Output: `12` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes numbers optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
