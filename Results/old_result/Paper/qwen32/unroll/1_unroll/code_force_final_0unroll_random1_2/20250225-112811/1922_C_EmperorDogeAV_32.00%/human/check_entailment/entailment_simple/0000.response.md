Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by determining the closest city for each city and then using this information to calculate the minimum cost for each query. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it incorrectly calculates the cost to travel to the closest city. The function should return an array where each element indicates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city. However, in the current implementation, the function does not correctly handle the case when the closest city is the previous city. Specifically, for the last city, it incorrectly sets the cost to travel to the next city (which doesn't exist) to a large positive value. Additionally, the function does not handle the case when the closest city is the previous city correctly.

2. **Incorrect Use of Pref Sum Arrays**: The program uses prefix sum arrays to calculate the cost for each query. However, the prefix sum arrays are not correctly calculated. The prefix sum arrays should store the cumulative cost to travel to the closest city for each city. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate these prefix sums.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program calculates the cost for each query by subtracting the prefix sums. However, the prefix sums are not correctly calculated, so the cost for each query is incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
