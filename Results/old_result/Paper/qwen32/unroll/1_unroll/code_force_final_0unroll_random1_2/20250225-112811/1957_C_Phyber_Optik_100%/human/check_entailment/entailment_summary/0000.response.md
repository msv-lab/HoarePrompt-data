### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a certain number of initial moves, given the rules of placing rooks without them attacking each other.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
    - The `dp` list is initialized with `-1` values, and then `func_1` is called with `300000` as an argument. This function precomputes the number of possible configurations for chessboards of different sizes up to `300000` using a dynamic programming approach.
    - The formula used in `func_1` is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This formula is derived from the problem's requirements and correctly reflects the number of ways to place rooks on a chessboard of size `i` without them attacking each other, considering the mirroring rules.

2. **Reading Input and Processing Each Test Case**:
    - For each test case, the program reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
    - It then reads the `k` initial moves and marks the rows and columns where rooks are already placed in the `invalid` set.
    - The program calculates the number of remaining rows and columns that are not yet occupied by rooks, which is `n - len(invalid)`.
    - It then uses the precomputed `dp` values to determine the number of possible configurations for the remaining board size. If no valid moves are left (`n - len(invalid) < 1`), it defaults to `1`.

3. **Output**:
    - For each test case, the program outputs the number of possible configurations modulo `1000000007`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. It precomputes the number of possible configurations for different board sizes using a dynamic programming approach and then uses these precomputed values to solve each test case efficiently. The formula used in `func_1` is consistent with the problem's requirements, and the program handles the input and output correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
