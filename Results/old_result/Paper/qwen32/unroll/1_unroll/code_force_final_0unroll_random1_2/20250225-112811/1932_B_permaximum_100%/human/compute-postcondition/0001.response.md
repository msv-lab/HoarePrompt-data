The only object in the loop head is the variable `test`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` has at least one element, as `test` will take on the value of each element in `test_cases` one by one.

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must contain at least one test case. The state of `t` and the structure of each test case in `test_cases` are already defined and do not need adjustment for the loop to start executing. The `results` list being empty does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one test case. The variable `test` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts since it will be assigned the first element of `test_cases` during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t test cases where each test case is represented as a tuple (n, a_list) and must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list**
