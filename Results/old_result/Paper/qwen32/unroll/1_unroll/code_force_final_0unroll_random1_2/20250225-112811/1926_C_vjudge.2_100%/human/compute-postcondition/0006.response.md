To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the variables involved.

- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `N` is a constant set to 200001.
- `pd` is a list where each element `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of all previous `pd` values plus the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to `i`.

The loop iterates `t` times. In each iteration:
- It reads an integer `n` from the input.
- It prints the value `pd[n]`.

Since the loop only reads values and prints corresponding values from the `pd` list, the state of `t`, `N`, and `pd` does not change after the loop. The only change is in the output, which is the printed values of `pd[n]` for each input `n`.

Thus, the output state of the variables `t`, `N`, and `pd` remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `N` is 200001; `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of all previous `pd` values plus the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to `i`.**
