Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in a list and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`. It also accepts a list of `n` distinct integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided integers and list.**
