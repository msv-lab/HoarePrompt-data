You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of lists containing only the characters '0' or '1'. Each grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: the loop will print 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each of the `a` iterations, and `t`, `n`, and the grid will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) and an `n x n` grid containing only the characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of all the '1's, with the size of the shape (k) greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
