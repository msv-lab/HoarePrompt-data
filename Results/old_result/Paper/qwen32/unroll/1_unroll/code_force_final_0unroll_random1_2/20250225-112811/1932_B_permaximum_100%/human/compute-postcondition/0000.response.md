The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `test_cases`. It only introduces a new variable `results` which is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t test cases where each test case is represented as a tuple (n, a_list). Here, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a_list is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list.**
