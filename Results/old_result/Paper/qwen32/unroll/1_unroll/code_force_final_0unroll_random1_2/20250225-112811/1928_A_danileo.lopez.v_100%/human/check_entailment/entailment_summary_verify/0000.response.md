Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
- He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- He then tries to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.
- We need to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one.

### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                (a1, a2) = (a // 2, a // 2)
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                (b1, b2) = (b // 2, b // 2)
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if either dimension is even.
- If one dimension is even, it divides it by 2 and checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
- If neither dimension is even, it prints "No".

### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- **Explanation:** The program does not handle cases where the rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles of equal size and then rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. For example, a \( 3 \times 3 \) rectangle can be cut into two \( 2 \times 1 \) rectangles and one \( 1 \times 1 \) rectangle, and the two \( 2 \times 1 \) rectangles can be rearranged to form a \( 2 \times 3 \) rectangle.

### Analysis:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program only considers splitting the rectangle along an even dimension and forming a new rectangle if the resulting dimensions are different. However, it fails to consider other valid ways to split and rearrange the rectangles.

Let's consider the counterexamples provided in the original assessment:
1. **Input:** `3 3`
   - The program will output `No` because neither dimension is even.
   - However, the \( 3 \times 3 \) rectangle can be cut into two \( 2 \times 1 \) rectangles and one \( 1 \times 1 \) rectangle, and the two \( 2 \times 1 \) rectangles can be rearranged to form a \( 2 \times 3 \) rectangle, which is considered different.

2. **Input:** `4 3`
   - The program will output `No` because neither dimension is even.
   - However, the \( 4 \times 3 \) rectangle can be cut into two \( 2 \times 3 \) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \( 3 \times 4 \) rectangle, which is considered different.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible ways to split and rearrange the rectangles to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final:** **False**
