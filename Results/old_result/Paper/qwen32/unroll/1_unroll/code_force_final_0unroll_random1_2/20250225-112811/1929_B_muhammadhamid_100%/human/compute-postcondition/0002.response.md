Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input where the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively. The function then processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
