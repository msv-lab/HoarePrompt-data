To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and behavior of each function, especially `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, which are responsible for constructing the permutation with the desired Manhattan value.

### Problem Recap

The goal is to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`. The Manhattan value is defined as:
\[ \text{Manhattan value} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \]

### Program Analysis

1. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - Reads input values `n` and `k`.
   - Checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
     - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

   This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Initializes a list `l` as a permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - Iterates in reverse order, adjusting the list to increase the Manhattan value by swapping elements.
   - Calls `func_2` when the remaining `k` can be achieved by a single swap.
   - Calls `func_3` to swap elements to increase the Manhattan value.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `-c - k`.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - Swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `c - 1`.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - Prints "YES" and the permutation.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**:
   - Calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is `0`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and then calls `func_5` to print it.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`

The logic in `func_1` to construct the permutation seems complex and not well-documented. Hereâ€™s a closer look:

- **Initialization**: The list `l` is initialized as `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates from `n` to `1` in steps of `-2`. For each iteration:
  - `c` is incremented by 1.
  - If `k` is 0, the function returns `l`.
  - If `k < i - 1`, it calls `func_2(c, k, l)`.
  - Otherwise, it updates `k` and calls `func_3(c, l)`.

The function `func_3` swaps elements at positions `-c` and `c-1`, effectively moving the element at position `c-1` to the end of the list and vice versa. This operation increases the Manhattan value by `2c - 1`.

The function `func_2` swaps elements at positions `-c` and `-c-k`, which is intended to adjust the permutation to achieve the remaining Manhattan value `k`.

### Verification Using Annotations

The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points:
- `func_1` modifies the list `l` through iterations and calls to `func_3`.
- `func_2` swaps specific elements to adjust the permutation.
- `func_3` swaps elements to increase the Manhattan value.

However, the annotations do not provide a clear proof that the constructed permutation will always have the exact Manhattan value `k`.

### Conclusion

The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is not well-documented and lacks a clear proof of correctness. While the program correctly handles the cases where `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it is not guaranteed to construct a valid permutation for all valid `k` values.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the program does not guarantee correctness for all valid inputs.

**Final: False**
