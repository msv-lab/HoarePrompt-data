Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The function returns the number of residents who want to live on the left side (i.e., the count of '0's in the string `a`).**
