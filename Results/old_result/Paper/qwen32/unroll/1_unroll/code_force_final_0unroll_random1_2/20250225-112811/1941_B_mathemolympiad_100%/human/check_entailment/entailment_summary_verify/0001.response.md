### Reasoning:

The provided program has several logical flaws that prevent it from correctly determining whether all elements of the array can be reduced to zero using the specified operations. Let's analyze the issues systematically using the function summary and the problem description.

1. **Operation Handling:**
   - The program calculates `opNum` based on `a[i]` but does not verify whether `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]` have sufficient values to perform the operations. Specifically, `a[i+1]` must be at least `2 * opNum` and `a[i+2]` must be at least `opNum` for the operation to be valid.
   - The current implementation does not check these constraints, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Negative Values:**
   - The program correctly identifies if any element becomes negative during the operations and immediately prints "NO". However, this check is necessary but not sufficient. The problem requires all elements to be exactly zero, not just non-negative.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check only considers the last two elements. However, if any element before the last two is not zero, the answer should be "NO". The current implementation does not check these elements.

4. **Incremental Operations:**
   - The program processes elements incrementally from the start of the array. However, the operations can be performed in any order, and the program does not account for this flexibility. It might miss valid sequences of operations that could reduce the entire array to zero.

### Revised Analysis:

Given these issues, let's consider a more comprehensive approach to solve the problem:

- **Parity Check:** One key insight is that the sum of the array elements must be even. This is because each operation reduces the sum of the array by 4 (1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`), and any sequence of such operations will maintain the parity of the sum.
- **Prefix Sum and Parity:** We can use a prefix sum approach to check if it's possible to make all elements zero. Specifically, we need to ensure that the prefix sums up to certain points can be balanced out by the operations.

However, the provided program does not incorporate these checks and logic. Therefore, it is not correct.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

### Final: **False**
