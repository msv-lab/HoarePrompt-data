The function accepts two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each with attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance` if they are not equal. If `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`, it returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`.
