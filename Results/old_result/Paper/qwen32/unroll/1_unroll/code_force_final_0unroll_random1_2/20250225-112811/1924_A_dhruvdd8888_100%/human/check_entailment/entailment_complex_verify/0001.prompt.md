You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

        return print('YES')
        #The program returns None because print('YES') outputs 'YES' to the console but does not return any value.
    #State: `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters found in `s`; `ps` is the count of such sequences, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO

            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: xybaa
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`, then checks if there are at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters in `s`. If there are, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and, if applicable, constructs and prints a string of length `n` using characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, ensuring it includes the last characters of found sequences and additional characters to meet the length requirement.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`. If not, we need to output one string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` where `n` is the length of the strings to check, `k` is the number of distinct characters to use, and `m` is the length of the string `s`.
   - It then reads the string `s`.

2. **Building the Set of Usable Characters:**
   - `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Checking Subsequences:**
   - The program initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of characters found in `s` that are part of the usable characters.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`. If the character is in `us`, it adds it to `win`.
   - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it adds the current character to `ans` and clears `win`.
   - The variable `ps` counts how many times all `k` characters have been found in sequence.

4. **Output:**
   - If `ps` is at least `n`, it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets have been found as subsequences in `s`, and it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and attempts to construct a string of length `n` that is missing from `s`.

5. **Constructing a Missing String:**
   - The logic for constructing a missing string is flawed. The program tries to append characters from `us` that are not in `win` and appends 'a' to fill the remaining length. However, this logic does not guarantee that the constructed string will be a valid missing subsequence.

### Issues with the Program

- **Incorrect Subsequence Checking Logic:** The program does not correctly check for all possible subsequences of length `n`. It only checks for sequences that contain all `k` characters in order, which is not sufficient.
- **Flawed Missing String Construction:** The logic for constructing a missing string is incorrect. It does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid subsequence that is missing from `s`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly check for all possible subsequences and does not properly construct a missing subsequence.

**Correctness: False**
