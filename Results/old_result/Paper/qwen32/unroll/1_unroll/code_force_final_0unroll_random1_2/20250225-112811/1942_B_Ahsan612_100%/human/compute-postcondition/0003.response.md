Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, then computes and prints a list `res` of `n` integers where each element `res[i]` is determined by subtracting the corresponding element `a[i]` from a variable `mex` initialized to `n`, updating `mex` to the minimum value encountered during the computation.**
