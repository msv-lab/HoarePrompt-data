To determine the output state, we need to understand the given initial state and the effect of the loop on the `ans` list.

Initial State: `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.

The loop iterates over the range from `lk` to `l` (exclusive) and appends `2 ** i` to the `ans` list in each iteration.

Let's denote the values of `lk` and `l` as `start` and `end` respectively for clarity. The loop will run for `i` in the range `[start, end)`.

After the loop, the `ans` list will have the original elements `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by the elements `2 ** start, 2 ** (start + 1), ..., 2 ** (end - 1)`.

Output State: **[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** lk, 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)]**.
