To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the provided code. The code processes `t` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k`. The logic in the loop depends on whether `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` or not.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `s = 0`: Accumulates a sum.
   - `i = 0`: Counts iterations.
   - `d = n`: Tracks the remaining elements.
   - `h = n`: Another tracker for remaining elements.
   - `p = 1`: Another iteration counter.
   - `g = 0`: Accumulates another sum.

2. **Condition `k > (n + 1) // 2`:**
   - The first `while` loop:
     - Continues while `s < k` and `d > 0`.
     - In each iteration, `s` is incremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, `d` is decremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The second `while` loop:
     - Continues while `p <= i - 1`.
     - In each iteration, `g` is incremented by `(h + 1) // 2`, `h` is decremented by `(h + 1) // 2`, and `p` is incremented by 1.
   - `f = k - g` calculates the difference between `k` and `g`.
   - `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` computes the final result.
   - The result `y` is printed.

3. **Condition `k <= (n + 1) // 2`:**
   - The result `2 * k - 1` is printed directly.

### Output State:

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is the set of results printed for each test case. Since the code processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the state of variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y` is not retained across test cases. Each test case starts with fresh initial values, and the only state that persists is the number of test cases `t`.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the result of the respective test case based on the provided logic.**
