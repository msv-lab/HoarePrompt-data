Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each test case, `s` is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') such that 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500.**

In this output state, `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, and the precondition for `s` remains unchanged as it has not been affected by the code snippet provided.
