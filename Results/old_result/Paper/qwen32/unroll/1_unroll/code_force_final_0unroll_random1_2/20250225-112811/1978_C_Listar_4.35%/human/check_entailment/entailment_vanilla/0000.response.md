Let's analyze the provided code and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that the Manhattan value \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \) equals \( k \).
- If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".
- If such a permutation exists, we output "Yes" followed by the permutation.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input values \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is even. If not, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation can exist.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k`:
     - If \( n \) is odd, `max_k` is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If \( n \) is even, `max_k` is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `max_k` is less than \( k \), it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs a permutation for given \( n \) and \( k \) (where \( k \) is already halved).
   - It initializes a list `l` with values from \( 1 \) to \( n \).
   - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, adjusting the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic for adjusting the list is somewhat complex and relies on moving the last element to specific positions based on the value of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to get \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is 0 (indicating no valid permutation), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and `func_3` to print it.

### Issues and Correctness:
- The code assumes that the Manhattan value can only be achieved if \( k \) is even. This is correct because the Manhattan value is always even for any permutation.
- The calculation of `max_k` is correct based on the problem constraints.
- The logic in `func_1` is complex and may not correctly construct a permutation for all valid \( k \). It does not guarantee that the resulting Manhattan value will always be \( k \) for all valid test cases.

### Conclusion:
The code does not guarantee correctness for all valid inputs because the logic in `func_1` may not always produce a permutation with the exact Manhattan value \( k \). Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be assured without further validation of `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
