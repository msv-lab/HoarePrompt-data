The function `func_1` takes four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each within the range from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of a secret permutation `p`. It prints these four integers in a formatted string, prompts for user input, and returns the stripped version of the input received from the user.
