The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`. For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be at least 1. The initial state provides that `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. Since `n_cases` is already within the required range, no adjustment is needed for `n_cases` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts, as it will be set to 0 automatically by the `range` function.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4**
