Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, each test case starts with two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. This is followed by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters 'W' or 'B' representing the colors of the squares in the grid. The sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000. The other details about the test cases (dimensions of the grid and the grid itself) remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.
