#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd; b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is a 2D grid of size N x M, where each cell contains either "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". The number of players for each team (R and B) is between 1 and 10. There is exactly one Quaffle and at most one Bludger on the field. The number of steps (T) is a non-negative integer where 0 <= T <= 10000. Each step is a valid action performed by an entity on the field, which can be a player or a ball.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (x + dx, y + dy)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two tuples as parameters: `a` which contains the initial coordinates `(x, y)`, and `b` which contains the movement `(dx, dy)`. It returns a new tuple representing the updated coordinates `(x + dx, y + dy)` after applying the movement to the initial coordinates.
