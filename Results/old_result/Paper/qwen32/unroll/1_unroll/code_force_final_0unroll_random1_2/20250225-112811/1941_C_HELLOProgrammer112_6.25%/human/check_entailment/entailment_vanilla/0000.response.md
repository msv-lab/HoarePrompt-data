Reasoning:
The provided program is incorrect because it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and outputs their sum. This approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions needed to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" is a substring of the resulting string. Counting the occurrences of these substrings does not account for the fact that removing one character could prevent multiple instances of these substrings.

For example, consider the string "mappppie". The program would output 3 (1 for "map" and 2 for "pie"), but the correct answer is 2, as removing the 4th and 9th characters (the 'p's) would make the string beautiful by removing both "map" and "pie".

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated algorithm would be needed to determine the minimum deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
