To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the program step by step:

### Problem Understanding

1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**:
   - A sequence of "(" and ")" where the balance (number of "(" minus number of ")") is 0.
   - Every prefix of the sequence has a non-negative balance.

2. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**:
   - For each character in the sequence, compute the balance of the prefix before that character.
   - Create a table of prefix balance, position, and character.
   - Sort the table by prefix balance in increasing order. In case of ties, sort by position in decreasing order.
   - Form a new sequence using the characters from the sorted table.

### Program Explanation

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to be a comparator for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It first compares the balance. If they are different, it returns the difference.
   - If the balances are the same, it returns the negative of the position difference, ensuring higher positions come first in case of ties.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This is the main function that performs the balanced shuffle.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates through the input string `s`, updating the balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to the list.
   - It sorts `balance_info` using the comparator `func_1`.
   - It constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.
   - It prints the result.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Comparator Function**:
   - The comparator function `func_1` correctly implements the sorting criteria: sort by balance ascending, and by position descending in case of ties.

2. **Main Function**:
   - The main function `func_2` correctly calculates the balance for each prefix and stores it in `balance_info`.
   - It sorts `balance_info` as required.
   - It constructs and prints the balanced shuffle correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case of the smallest balanced sequence "()" correctly.
   - The program handles longer balanced sequences as demonstrated in the example.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the sorting criteria and constructs the result string accurately.

**Correctness: True**
