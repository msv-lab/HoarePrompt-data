Output State: **For each test case, the variable `ans` will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `ans` is 'YES' if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color, or if there is at least one adjacent pair of cells in the top row or the bottom row that have different colors, or at least one adjacent pair of cells in the first and last columns that have different colors. The variable `ans` is 'NO' if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are different colors and all cells in the top row and bottom row are the same color, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same color. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `gr` will be in their final states after processing all test cases, where `t` will be 0 (as all test cases have been processed), `n` and `m` will be the dimensions of the last test case, and `gr` will be the grid of the last test case.**
