To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the given code snippet and its behavior:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`.
3. The inner loop iterates over the indices of the strings `a` and `b` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 each time (i.e., it checks every second character starting from the second character).
4. Inside the inner loop, it checks two conditions:
   - If the current character in `a` and the next character in `b` are both '<', or
   - If the current character in `a` and the previous character in `b` are both '<'.
5. If either of these conditions is met, it prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
6. If the inner loop completes without finding any such pair, it prints 'Yes'.

Given the above behavior, the output for each test case will either be 'No' or 'Yes'. Since the code processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final output state will be a series of 'No' or 'Yes' responses, one for each test case.

Output State: **A series of 'No' or 'Yes' responses, one for each test case.**
