Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the cost for Kirill to move to the desired position. The program iterates over the positions from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` and adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the cost. This approach does not consider the actual cost of moving Kirill to a specific position `m` by potentially bribing multiple people.

2. **Bribing Multiple People**: Kirill can bribe multiple people to move to a position `m`. The program does not account for the fact that bribing a person at position `j` affects the positions of all people between `j` and `i`. It also does not consider the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people.

3. **Handling of `b_values`**: The program incorrectly uses `b_values[y]` as a cost for moving Kirill to position `y`. The value `b_values[y]` represents the cost Kirill has to pay to the person at position `k` (where `j < k < i`) if he bribes the person at position `j`. The program does not correctly handle the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people.

4. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions in the program are incorrect. The program should consider the cost of bribing people in a way that minimizes the total cost to move Kirill to the desired position `m`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if `m = 1`, Kirill should directly bribe the person at position `1` if necessary. The program does not correctly handle such cases.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
