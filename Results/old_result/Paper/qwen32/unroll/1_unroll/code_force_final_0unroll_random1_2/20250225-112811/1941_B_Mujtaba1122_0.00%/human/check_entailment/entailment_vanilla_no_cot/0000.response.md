Correctness: **False**

The given program contains a logical error in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the operations inside the `while` loop are incorrect. The loop currently subtracts the entire value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]`, which is not the intended operation as per the problem statement.

The correct operation should be to subtract `1` from `list[i - 1]`, `2` from `list[i]`, and `1` from `list[i + 1]` in each iteration, not the entire value of `list[i - 1]`.

Here is the corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

With this correction, the program should correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.
