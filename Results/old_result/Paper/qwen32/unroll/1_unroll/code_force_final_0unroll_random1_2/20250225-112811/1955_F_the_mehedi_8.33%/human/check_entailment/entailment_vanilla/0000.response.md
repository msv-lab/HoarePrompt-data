Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.
2. **Winning Condition**: Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
3. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.
4. **Key Insight**:
   - Bob can only win if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - If there are an even number of each number (1, 2, 3, 4), their XOR will be zero.
   - If there is an odd number of each number (1, 2, 3), their XOR will be non-zero unless the numbers are paired perfectly to cancel each other out.

### Strategy for Eve to Maximize Bob's Wins

1. **Initial Check**:
   - If there are an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, and they are all equal, Bob can win once at the beginning.
2. **General Strategy**:
   - Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that Bob can win the maximum number of times.
   - For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), Eve can remove pairs of numbers to ensure that the remaining numbers can still result in a zero XOR.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given strategy.

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd and equal. If so, it increments the count by 1, indicating that Bob can win once initially.
2. **General Strategy**:
   - The program then iterates over each count and adds the floor division of the count by 2 to the total count. This effectively counts the number of pairs that can be removed, allowing Bob to win in subsequent rounds.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Bob wins once initially because there is an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s that are all equal.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Bob wins once if Eve removes one 1 and one 3.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Eve can remove pairs of 1s, 2s, and 3s, allowing Bob to win three times.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Eve can remove pairs of 1s and 2s, and one 3, allowing Bob to win three times.

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Output: `12`
   - Explanation: Eve can remove pairs of 2s, 3s, and 4s, allowing Bob to win twelve times.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly implement the strategy for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
