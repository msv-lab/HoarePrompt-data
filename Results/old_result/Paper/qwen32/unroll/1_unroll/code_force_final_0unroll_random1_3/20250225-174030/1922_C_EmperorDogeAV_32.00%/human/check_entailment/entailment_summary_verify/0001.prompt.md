You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = input().split()
    for i in range(n):
        cities[i] = int(cities[i])

        forward = 99999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates in ascending order and calculates a list where each element represents the closest city or the distance to the closest city for each city in the input list, excluding the first and last cities. The function returns this list of closest city indicators or distances.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as per the description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Finding Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to determine the cost of moving to the closest city for each city.
   - It iterates through the cities and calculates the distance to the previous and next city.
   - If the next city is closer, it assigns `1` (cost to move to the closest city), otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city.
   - This is done twice: once for the forward direction (left to right) and once for the backward direction (right to left).

3. **Calculating Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward costs.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total cost of moving from one city to another using the closest city path.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (from `a` to `b` or from `b` to `a`).
   - It then calculates the total cost using the appropriate prefix sums.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the cost of moving to the closest city.
   - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)` is incorrect because it should be checking if the next city is closer than the previous city, but the cost should always be `1` when moving to the closest city.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If the next city is closer, set `prog_cities[i] = 1`.
     - If the previous city is closer, set `prog_cities[i] = 1`.
     - If the next and previous cities are equidistant, the problem guarantees that this won't happen, so no special handling is needed.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated correctly based on the incorrect costs from `func_1`.
   - Since the costs are incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The logic for processing queries is correct assuming the prefix sums are correct.
   - However, due to the incorrect prefix sums, the final results will be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the cost of moving to the closest city, leading to incorrect prefix sums and, consequently, incorrect results for the queries.
