### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by constructing a valid permutation `p` from the given array `a`. The key idea is to work backwards from the end of the array `a` to the beginning, calculating the corresponding values in `p` using the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible MEX value for an array of length `n`.

2. **Backward Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the array `a` from the last element to the first.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - After calculating `p[i]`, it updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet been used in `p`.

3. **Output:**
   - The calculated permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

The core logic seems sound based on the problem description. The program correctly processes each test case, computes the permutation `p` by working backwards from the array `a`, and ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied at each step.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic of the program that affects its correctness. Specifically, the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is intended to update `mex` to the minimum value, but it does not correctly handle the case where `mex - ar[i]` might be negative. Since the MEX value is always non-negative, the program should ensure that `mex` is never set to a negative value.

To fix this, the `mex` should be updated as follows:
```python
mex = min(mex, mex - ar[i])
if mex < 0:
    mex = 0
```
or more succinctly:
```python
mex = max(0, min(mex, mex - ar[i]))
```
This ensures that `mex` remains a non-negative integer, which is necessary for the MEX calculation.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the current implementation may produce incorrect results in cases where `mex - ar[i]` results in a negative value. Therefore, the program as it stands is not fully correct.

**Correctness: False**
