Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### 1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array of integers.
   - We can perform an operation a limited number of times (up to 500,000) to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The operation involves choosing a subarray and setting all elements of this subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray.
   - We need to output the maximum possible sum and a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

### 2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function seems to be a recursive function that modifies the array `a` in the range `[l, r]` by setting all elements to the MEX of the subarray. It also records the operations performed.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the final sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: This is a recursive function that divides the array into subarrays and recursively maximizes the sum of each subarray. It seems to check if the sum of the current subarray is less than the sum of its length squared, which would imply that the subarray can be improved by setting its elements to its length (the MEX of a sorted array from 0 to `r-l`).
   - **Function 4 (`func_3`)**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the result.

### 3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the array `a` and the list `ops`. This will result in a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: The function does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray. It incorrectly assumes that setting the subarray to its length will always be optimal, which is not necessarily true based on the problem description.
   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: The function does not correctly handle the operations list `ops`. It attempts to append operations to `ops` without passing it correctly.
   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: The function does not correctly handle the base case when `l == r`. It should handle this case separately.

### 4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. The logic for calculating the MEX and performing the operations is flawed, and the program does not correctly handle the operations list.

**Correctness: False**
