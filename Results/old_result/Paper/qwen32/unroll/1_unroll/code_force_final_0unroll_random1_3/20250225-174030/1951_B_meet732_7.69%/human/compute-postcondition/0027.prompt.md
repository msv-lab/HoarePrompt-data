You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: a is a list containing multiple test cases, where each test case is represented as a list. Each test case list starts with two integers n and k, followed by n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. Here, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is the number of test cases, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 is the number of cows, 1 ≤ k ≤ n is the index of the cow owned by the user, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 are the distinct Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
```
def func_1(a):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns n - 1.

Case_2: The program returns k - 1. Since k is either 14 or remains unchanged, and we know that if k is 14 it stays 14, the return value will be either 13 or k - 1 depending on the original value of k (if it was not 14).

Case_3: The program returns the first element of `ind` minus 1, where the first element of `ind` is greater than 14

Case_4: The program returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is an index greater than 0 and less than or equal to `k`.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.

Case_6: The program returns the larger value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
