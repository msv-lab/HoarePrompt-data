You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a list `res` where each element is derived from the difference between a variable `mex` and the corresponding element in `a`. The variable `mex` is adjusted during the computation to ensure the conditions are met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program does not correctly compute the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Specifically, the logic for updating the MEX value and constructing the permutation \( p \) is flawed.

The main issue lies in the way the MEX value is being updated. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not yet in the permutation \( p \). However, the program incorrectly updates the MEX value based on the difference between the current MEX and the current element in \( a \). This can lead to incorrect MEX values and consequently, an incorrect permutation \( p \).

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will not produce the correct output because it incorrectly updates the MEX value. The MEX value should be recalculated based on the current state of the permutation \( p \) being constructed, not just by subtracting the current element in \( a \) from the current MEX value.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and update the MEX value dynamically as we construct the permutation \( p \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

In this corrected version, we maintain a set `used` to keep track of the numbers that have already been used in the permutation \( p \). We then dynamically update the MEX value by incrementing it until we find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used`. This ensures that the permutation \( p \) is constructed correctly based on the array \( a \).
