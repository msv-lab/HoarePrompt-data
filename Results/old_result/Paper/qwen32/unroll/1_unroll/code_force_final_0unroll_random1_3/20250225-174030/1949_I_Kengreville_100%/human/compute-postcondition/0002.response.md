The code snippet `y = [None] * n` reassigns the list `y` to be a new list containing `n` `None` values. The previous list `y` (which was a list of integers where each element satisfied -10^9 <= y[i] <= 10^9) is replaced by this new list. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` None values, `y` is a list of `n` None values, `r` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and `coef` is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.**
