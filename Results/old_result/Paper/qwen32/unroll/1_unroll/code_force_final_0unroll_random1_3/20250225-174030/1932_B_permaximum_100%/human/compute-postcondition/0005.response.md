Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` containing `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case's list.**
