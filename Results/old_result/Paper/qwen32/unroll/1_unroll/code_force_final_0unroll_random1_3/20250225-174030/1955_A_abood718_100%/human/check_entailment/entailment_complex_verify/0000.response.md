### Reasoning:

Let's review the program and the annotations to ensure the logic is correct.

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
   - The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The logic in the program is as follows:
     1. If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`a * 2`), then it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
     2. If `n` is even, the best option is to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible, which costs `int(A * C / 2)`.
     3. If `n` is odd, the best option is to buy the maximum number of pairs of yogurts and then buy one yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `X * C + B`, where `X` is the number of pairs (`A // 2`).

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Case when `b < 2 * a`:** This is handled correctly by the program. If the promotion price is cheaper, it buys all yogurts individually.
   - **Case when `n` is even:** The program correctly calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible.
   - **Case when `n` is odd:** The program correctly calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible and then buying one yogurt individually.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case correctly, calculates the cost based on the conditions, and prints the result.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The original assessment tested several edge cases, including `n = 1`, `n = 2`, and larger values of `n` (both even and odd). The output matched the expected results.

6. **Testing the Program:**
   - The test cases provided in the original assessment were run, and the output matched the expected results, indicating that the program handles the edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the program seems to correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The annotations and the original assessment both support the correctness of the program.

**Final: True**
