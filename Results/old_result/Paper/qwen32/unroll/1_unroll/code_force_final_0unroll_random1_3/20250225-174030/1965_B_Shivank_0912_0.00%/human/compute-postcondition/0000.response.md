The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected by this code. The preconditions about `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each element in `cases` is a tuple (n, k) where n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. `results` is an empty list.**
