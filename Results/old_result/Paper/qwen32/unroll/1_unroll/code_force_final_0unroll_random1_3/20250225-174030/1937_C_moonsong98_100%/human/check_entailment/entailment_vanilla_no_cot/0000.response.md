Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the maximum XOR pair within the given constraints. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Finding the maximum value**: The current strategy to find the maximum value (`max_index`) only considers comparisons with the first element (`0`). This approach is flawed and might not find the actual maximum element in the permutation.

2. **Finding the minimum value**: Similarly, the program tries to find the minimum value (`min_index`) by comparing it with the maximum value found earlier. However, it does not guarantee that the minimum value found will yield the maximum XOR with the maximum value.

3. **Handling equal values**: The program handles equal values by storing them in a list (`min_indices`). However, it does not correctly determine the final `min_index` from this list, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. **XOR maximization**: The program does not ensure that the pair of indices it finds will yield the maximum XOR value. The strategy used does not guarantee that the maximum possible XOR value is achieved.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using binary search or a divide-and-conquer strategy to compare elements and find the maximum XOR pair within the allowed number of queries.
