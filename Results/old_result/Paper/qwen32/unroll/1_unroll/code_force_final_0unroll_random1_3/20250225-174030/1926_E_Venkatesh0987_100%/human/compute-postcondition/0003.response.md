Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is greater than half of `n` plus one, it performs a series of calculations involving halving and powers of two to determine the output. Otherwise, it directly computes `2 * k - 1`. The output is a series of integers, each corresponding to a test case.**
