### Reasoning:

There are a few issues with the provided program that need to be addressed to determine its correctness:

1. **Incorrect Implementation of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the new position of an entity after a move. However, in the comments, it is incorrectly stated that `x` and `y` are both equal to `a` (the number of rows in the field) and `dx` and `dy` are both equal to `b` (the number of columns in the field). The correct implementation is to use the tuple `a` for `(x, y)` and `b` for `(dx, dy)`, which is correctly implemented in the function body: `return x + dx, y + dy`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Quaffle Catching**:
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is incorrect. It should be an assignment `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to indicate that the player `mo[0]` has caught the Quaffle.

3. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The conditions for scoring goals are incorrectly handled. The program checks if a player's position is in the goals list, but it should also check if the player is carrying the Quaffle (`quidditch[1] == mo[0]`). Additionally, the logic for moving the Quaffle to the middle field after scoring is incorrect. It should always move to the middle field regardless of the player's team.

4. **Incorrect Elimination Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies and eliminates players who collide with the Bludger, but the final handling of the Quaffle's position when a player is eliminated is incorrect. If a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, the Quaffle should remain at the player's position, not move to the middle field.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program is not entirely correct. The logic for catching the Quaffle, scoring goals, and handling eliminations needs to be fixed.

**Correctness: False**
