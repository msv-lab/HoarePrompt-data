### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, leading to the apocalypse. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculation**:
    - The variable `year` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the cumulative year up to which the signs have occurred.
    - For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign as follows:
        - `year += year % ai or ai`
        - This expression ensures that `year` is incremented by the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `year`. If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence is `year + ai`. If `year % ai` is not 0, the next occurrence is `year + (ai - year % ai)`, which simplifies to `year + ai - year % ai` or `year + ai` if `year % ai` is 0. In Python, the `or` operator ensures that if `year % ai` is 0, `ai` is used instead.
    - This process is repeated for each sign, ensuring that the occurrence of each subsequent sign is strictly after the previous one.

3. **Output**: After processing each test case, the program prints the final value of `year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input**: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Steps**:
    - `year = 0`
    - First sign: `year += 0 % 3 or 3` → `year = 3`
    - Second sign: `year += 3 % 2 or 2` → `year = 4`
    - Third sign: `year += 4 % 4 or 4` → `year = 8`
    - Fourth sign: `year += 8 % 5 or 5` → `year = 10`
    - Fifth sign: `year += 10 % 9 or 9` → `year = 18`
    - Sixth sign: `year += 18 % 18 or 18` → `year = 36`
- **Output**: `36`

The program correctly calculates the year for the n-th sign to occur for all test cases provided in the example.

### Conclusion:

The program accurately implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
