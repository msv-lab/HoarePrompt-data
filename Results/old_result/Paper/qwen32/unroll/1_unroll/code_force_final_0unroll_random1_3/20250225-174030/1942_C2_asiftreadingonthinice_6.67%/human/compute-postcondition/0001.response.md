The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop index. The loop will execute if `tt` (the number of iterations) is at least 1. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers representing the vertices do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`tt` is an integer such that `tt` ≥ 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `ii` is 0**
