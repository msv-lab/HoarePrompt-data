To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the components involved:

- `data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by spaces.
- `idx` is the position after the last element used in the loop. However, this variable is not directly relevant to the print statement.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, which likely represents the number of test cases or queries.
- `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, with an empty string after each test case's results.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

Since the initial state specifies that `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, followed by an empty string after each test case, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, each on a new line, with an additional empty line after each test case's results.

Given the format of the `results` list, the output will be structured as follows:
- Each 'YES' or 'NO' will be on a separate line.
- An empty line will appear after the results of each test case.

However, without the exact contents of the `results` list, we can only describe the format of the output based on the provided information.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' on each line, followed by an empty line after each test case's results**.
