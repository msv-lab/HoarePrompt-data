list is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers (0 \le a_j \le 10^9) representing the elements of the array for each test case, and n is an integer such that 3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5. The outer list (list) contains t sublists, where t is the number of test cases (1 \le t \le 10^4). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
