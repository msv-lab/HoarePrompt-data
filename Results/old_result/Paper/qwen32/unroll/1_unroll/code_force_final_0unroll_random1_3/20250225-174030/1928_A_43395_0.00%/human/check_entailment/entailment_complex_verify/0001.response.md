### Reasoning:

Let's review the program and the annotations to evaluate the correctness of the solution against the problem description.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- Bob can form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles if:
  - He can cut the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
  - These two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
- Key Observations:
  - If either dimension is 1, it cannot be cut into two distinct rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
  - If both dimensions are even, the rectangle can always be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
  - If one dimension is even and the other is odd, the rectangle can also be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
  - If both dimensions are odd, the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of size 1x(odd), which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

**Program Analysis:**
The provided program contains several logical errors:
1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`**:
   - This condition is incorrect because it compares a tuple to a boolean value, which doesn't make sense.
   - It doesn't correctly implement the logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.

2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**:
   - This condition is always true if `a` and `b` are not equal, which is not the correct logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.
   - It doesn't handle the case where both dimensions are odd correctly.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program doesn't correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd.
   - The program doesn't correctly handle the case where either dimension is 1.

**Correct Logic:**
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, print "no".
- If both `a` and `b` are not 1, print "yes".

**Corrected Program:**
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

**Annotations Validation:**
- The annotations correctly identify the issues in the program and the overall behavior.
- The annotations point out that the conditions used in the program are incorrect and don't implement the required logic.

**Conclusion:**
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program contains logical errors and does not correctly solve the problem as described. The corrected logic should be implemented as shown above.

**Final:**
Final: **False**
