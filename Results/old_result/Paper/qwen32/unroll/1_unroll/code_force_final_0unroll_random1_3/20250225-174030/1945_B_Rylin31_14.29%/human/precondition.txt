Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), where a and b are the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m is the duration (in minutes) for which each firework is visible in the sky. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.
