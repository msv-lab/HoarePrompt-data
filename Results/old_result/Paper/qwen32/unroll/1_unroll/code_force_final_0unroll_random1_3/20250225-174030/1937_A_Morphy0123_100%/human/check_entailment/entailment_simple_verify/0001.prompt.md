You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a sequence of swaps on an array where initially, `a[i] = i` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The swap operation `swap(k)` swaps the elements at positions `d` and `k`, where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` other than `k` itself. The task is to determine the final position of the element `1` after performing `swap(i)` for all `i` from `2` to `n`.

### Key Observations:
- For `n = 1`, the array remains `[1]`, and the position of `1` is `1`.
- For `n > 1`, the element `1` will eventually be moved to a position that is a power of `2` due to the nature of the swap operations and the largest divisor property.
- The final position of `1` will be the largest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`. If `n == 1`, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `n` by using the logarithm base `2` of `n` and adjusting it appropriately.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`.
3. If `n == 1`, it prints `1`.
4. Otherwise, it calculates `log2(n)` and finds the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `n` by adjusting the logarithm value.
5. It prints the result.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:
- For `n = 1`, the output is `1`, which is correct.
- For `n = 4`, the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `4` is `4`, which is correct.
- For `n = 5`, the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `5` is `4`, which is correct.
- For `n = 120240229`, the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `120240229` is `67108864`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the position of `1` after the sequence of swap operations. It correctly handles the edge case `n = 1` and calculates the correct position for larger values of `n`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
