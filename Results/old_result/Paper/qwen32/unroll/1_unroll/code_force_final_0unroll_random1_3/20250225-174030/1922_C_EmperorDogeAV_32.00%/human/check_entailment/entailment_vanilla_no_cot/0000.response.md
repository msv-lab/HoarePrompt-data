Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to determine whether the closest city to the current city is the next city (forward) or the previous city (backward) and return the appropriate cost. However, the implementation is incorrect for several reasons:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost to move to the closest city for each city. But the current implementation incorrectly calculates the cost as `1` if the forward city is closer and `abs(forward - cities[i])` otherwise. It should always return `1` when the closest city is the forward or backward city, not the distance.

2. The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the current city is the first or last city in the list correctly. The `back` and `forward` variables should be set to `None` or a sentinel value to handle these edge cases properly, but they are set to `-99999999` and `99999999`, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. The `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` arrays are used to calculate the cumulative cost of moving to the closest city from the start or end of the list, respectively. However, since `func_1` does not return the correct costs, these cumulative sums will also be incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = cities[i - 1] if i > 0 else float('-inf')
        forward = cities[i + 1] if i < n - 1 else float('inf')
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1
    return prog_cities
```

However, this implementation still has issues because it does not correctly identify the closest city when the cities are at the boundaries. A more correct approach would be to precompute the closest city for each city and then use this information to calculate the cost for each query.

Given the above issues, the program is not correct as it stands.
