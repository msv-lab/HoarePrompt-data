Output State: **The program returns the first element of `ind` minus 1, where the first element of `ind` is greater than 14**

Explanation: Given that `ind` is a list containing indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x` and the length of `ind` is 1, we know that `ind` has exactly one element. This element is greater than `k`, and if `k` is 14, then the element of `ind` is greater than 14. Therefore, the program returns this element minus 1.
