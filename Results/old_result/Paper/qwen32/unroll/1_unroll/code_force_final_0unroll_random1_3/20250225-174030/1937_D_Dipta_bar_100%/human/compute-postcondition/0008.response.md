To determine the output state, we need to execute the given loop with the provided initial state and the loop code. However, the variable `n` and `s` are not defined in the initial state. For the sake of this example, let's assume `n` is the length of the string `s` and `s` is a string of some length `n` that contains the character '<' at certain positions.

Given the initial state:
- `A = [0, 2, 6, 9, 13]`
- `idx_A = [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]`
- `B = []`
- `idx_B = []`

We need to assume a value for `n` and `s`. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1` and uses `i = n - 1 - j`, let's assume `n` is 5 (the length of `idx_A`), and `s` is a string of length 5 that contains '<' at positions that match the indices in `idx_A`.

Let's assume `s = "a<a<a<a"` (which means `s[1] = '<'`, `s[3] = '<'`, and `s[4] = '<'`).

Now, let's execute the loop step by step:

1. **Iteration 1 (j = 0, i = 4):**
   - `s[4] == '<'` is True.
   - `len(idx_B) == 0` is True.
   - `B.append(0)` → `B = [0]`
   - `idx_B.append(4)` → `idx_B = [4]`

2. **Iteration 2 (j = 1, i = 3):**
   - `s[3] == '<'` is True.
   - `len(idx_B) == 0` is False.
   - `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`
     - `x = 0 + (4 - 3) * 1 = 1`
   - `B.append(1)` → `B = [0, 1]`
   - `idx_B.append(3)` → `idx_B = [4, 3]`

3. **Iteration 3 (j = 2, i = 2):**
   - `s[2] == '<'` is False.
   - No changes to `B` or `idx_B`.

4. **Iteration 4 (j = 3, i = 1):**
   - `s[1] == '<'` is True.
   - `len(idx_B) == 0` is False.
   - `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`
     - `x = 1 + (3 - 1) * 2 = 5`
   - `B.append(5)` → `B = [0, 1, 5]`
   - `idx_B.append(1)` → `idx_B = [4, 3, 1]`

5. **Iteration 5 (j = 4, i = 0):**
   - `s[0] == '<'` is False.
   - No changes to `B` or `idx_B`.

After all iterations, the final state is:
- `A` remains `[0, 2, 6, 9, 13]`
- `idx_A` remains `[0, 2, 4, 5, 6]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 5]`
- `idx_B` is `[4, 3, 1]`

Output State: **A is [0, 2, 6, 9, 13] and idx_A is [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]; B is [0, 1, 5]; idx_B is [4, 3, 1].**
