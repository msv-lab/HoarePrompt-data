The given print statement is:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

The precondition provides information about several variables and objects, but for the purpose of this print statement, we only need to focus on the `points` list. The `points` list contains the scores for the two teams. Specifically:
- `points[0]` represents the score of the first team.
- `points[1]` represents the score of the second team.

Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] is the score of the first team and points[1] is the score of the second team)**
