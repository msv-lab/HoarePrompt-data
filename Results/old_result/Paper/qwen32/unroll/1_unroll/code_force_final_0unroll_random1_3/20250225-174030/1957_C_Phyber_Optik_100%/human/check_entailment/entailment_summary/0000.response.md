Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after `k` moves have been made and the remaining moves are played optimally by both players. However, the implementation provided does not correctly address the problem's requirements.

The program includes a dynamic programming function `func_1` that calculates the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard without considering any pre-existing moves. This function seems to be an attempt to precompute the number of configurations for different board sizes up to 300,000, but it does not take into account the `k` moves that have already been played and the specific positions of those moves.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the number of invalid rows and columns based on the `k` moves, and then uses the precomputed `dp` array to determine the number of valid configurations for the remaining board. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the mirrored nature of the moves and the specific positions of the rooks on the board.

The problem specifies that the computer mirrors the player's moves unless the row and column are the same, and this mirroring affects the number of valid configurations. The program does not implement this mirroring logic or adjust the board configuration based on the specific moves made.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
