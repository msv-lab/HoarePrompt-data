### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. The logic of the program is based on the following observations:

1. **Base Case:** If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid are the same color, it is always possible to make the entire grid that color by selecting appropriate pairs of squares. Hence, the answer is 'YES'.

2. **Special Case:** If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, the program checks whether the entire first and last rows and columns are uniform in color. If both the first and last rows, and the first and last columns, have all the same color (either all 'W' or all 'B'), then it is possible to make the entire grid that color. The reasoning behind this is that if the first and last rows and columns are uniform, we can use these rows and columns to propagate the color across the entire grid. If either the first or last row, or the first or last column, is not uniform, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform with the given operations, and the answer is 'NO'.

The program correctly implements this logic by:
- Checking if `gr[0][0]` is different from `gr[n-1][m-1]`.
- If they are different, it checks if all elements in the first and last rows are the same.
- It also checks if all elements in the first and last columns are the same.
- If either the rows or the columns are not uniform, it sets the answer to 'NO'.

The program's logic correctly handles all the given test cases as per the provided output.
