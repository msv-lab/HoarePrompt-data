To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Grid and Diagonals**: 
   - A square grid of size `n x n` has `4n - 2` diagonals.
   - The diagonals can be categorized into two types:
     - **Main Diagonals**: The main diagonal running from the top-left to the bottom-right and the main diagonal running from the top-right to the bottom-left.
     - **Secondary Diagonals**: The diagonals parallel to the main diagonals but not including the main diagonals themselves.

2. **Objective**:
   - Color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If `k = 4n - 2`, it means all diagonals need to have at least one colored cell. Since each cell can cover at most two diagonals (one from each direction), the minimum number of cells needed would be `(4n - 2) / 2`. However, due to the way diagonals intersect, we need to round up and add one more cell in some cases, hence `k // 2 + 1`.
   - For `k < 4n - 2`, the minimum number of cells needed is `ceil(k / 2)` because each cell can cover two diagonals, and we need to ensure that at least `k` diagonals are covered.

### Code Analysis:
The code provided follows this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- If `k == 4n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
- Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
   - `4n - 2 = 10`
   - `k < 4n - 2`, so the output should be `ceil(4 / 2) = 2`. This matches the expected output.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `k = 3`
   - `4n - 2 = 10`
   - `k < 4n - 2`, so the output should be `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`. This matches the expected output.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `k = 10`
   - `4n - 2 = 10`
   - `k == 4n - 2`, so the output should be `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`. This matches the expected output.

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 3`, `k = 9`
   - `4n - 2 = 10`
   - `k < 4n - 2`, so the output should be `ceil(9 / 2) = 5`. This matches the expected output.

5. **Test Case 5**: `n = 4`, `k = 7`
   - `4n - 2 = 14`
   - `k < 4n - 2`, so the output should be `ceil(7 / 2) = 4`. This matches the expected output.

6. **Test Case 6**: `n = 7`, `k = 11`
   - `4n - 2 = 26`
   - `k < 4n - 2`, so the output should be `ceil(11 / 2) = 6`. This matches the expected output.

7. **Test Case 7**: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
   - `4n - 2 = 6`
   - `k < 4n - 2`, so the output should be `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`. This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells needed to color at least `k` diagonals in an `n x n` grid. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
