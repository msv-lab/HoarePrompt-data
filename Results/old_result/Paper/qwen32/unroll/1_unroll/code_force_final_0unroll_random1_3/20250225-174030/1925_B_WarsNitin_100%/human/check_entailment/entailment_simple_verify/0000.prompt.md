You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective:** Break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of their difficulties is `x` and the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these difficulties is maximized.
- **Input:** 
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case: `x` (total difficulty) and `n` (number of sub-problems).
- **Output:** For each test case, print the maximum possible balance (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates through possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor, it checks if it is possible to create `n` sub-problems with difficulties that sum up to `x` and have `i` as their GCD. The program updates the maximum GCD found during this process.

#### Key Points:
1. **Iterating through Divisors:** The loop runs from `1` to `sqrt(x)`, checking each `i` to see if it divides `x` evenly.
2. **Checking Feasibility:** For each divisor `i`, the program checks if it's possible to distribute `x` into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `i`. It does this by checking if `(x - n * i) % i == 0` and similarly for `x // i`.
3. **Updating Maximum GCD:** The program keeps track of the maximum GCD found.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:** The program needs to correctly handle edge cases such as when `x` is very small or when `n` is equal to `x`.
- **Correctness of Logic:** The logic for determining the maximum GCD seems sound, but we need to verify if it covers all edge cases.

### Testing with Edge Cases:
1. **Test Case 1:** `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Possible difficulties: `[4, 2, 4]`
   - GCD: `2`
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Test Case 2:** `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Possible difficulties: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - GCD: `1`
   - This matches the expected output.

3. **Test Case 3:** `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Possible difficulties: `[6, 6, 6, ..., 6]` (69 times)
   - GCD: `6`
   - This matches the expected output.

4. **Edge Case:** `x = 1`, `n = 1`
   - Possible difficulties: `[1]`
   - GCD: `1`
   - This matches the expected output.

5. **Edge Case:** `x = 10`, `n = 1`
   - Possible difficulties: `[10]`
   - GCD: `10`
   - This matches the expected output.

6. **Edge Case:** `x = 10`, `n = 10`
   - Possible difficulties: `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]` (10 times)
   - GCD: `1`
   - This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it with various edge cases, it appears to correctly compute the maximum balance (GCD) for all sub-problems.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the divisors of `x` and checks if it's feasible to create `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem's difficulty being a multiple of the current divisor. It updates the maximum GCD found and handles various edge cases correctly.
