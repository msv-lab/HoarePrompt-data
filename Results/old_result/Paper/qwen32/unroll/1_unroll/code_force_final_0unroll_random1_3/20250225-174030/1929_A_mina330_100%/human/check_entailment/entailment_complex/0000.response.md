### Reasoning:

The task is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i - 1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, we need to maximize each individual difference \(a_i - a_{i - 1}\). This can be achieved by arranging the array in non-decreasing order and then calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array.

Here's why the given program is correct:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array in non-decreasing order.
2. **Calculating Maximum Beauty**: After sorting, the maximum value in the array will be at the last position (`a[len(a) - 1]`), and the minimum value will be at the first position (`a[0]`). The difference between these two values (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`) gives the maximum possible beauty of the array.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **First Test Case**: Input array = `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted array = `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty = \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\)
- **Second Test Case**: Input array = `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted array = `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty = \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0\)
- **Third Test Case**: Input array = `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted array = `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty = \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57\)

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and computing the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

**Correctness: True**
