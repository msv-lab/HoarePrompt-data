The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b`, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns the sum of `a` and `b` for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and, for each test case, two integers `a` and `b`. It returns the sum of `a` and `b` for each test case.**
