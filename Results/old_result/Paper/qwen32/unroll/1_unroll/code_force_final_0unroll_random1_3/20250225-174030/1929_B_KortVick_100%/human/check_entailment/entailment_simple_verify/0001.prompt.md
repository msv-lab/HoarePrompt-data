You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by two integers, n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The integer n represents the size of the square grid, and k represents the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- Sasha wants to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.
- The challenge is to figure out the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition.

### Observations:
1. **Diagonals in the Grid:**
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (let's call these "main diagonals").
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (let's call these "anti-diagonals").
   - The total number of diagonals is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Coloring Strategy:**
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to place colored cells in such a way that they cover as many diagonals as possible.
   - The optimal strategy is to color cells along the center of the grid (or as close to the center as possible) because these cells will cover the maximum number of diagonals.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to color cells on all diagonals. The minimum number of cells required in this case is \( n \) (one cell per main diagonal or anti-diagonal passing through the center).
   - For other values of \( k \), we need to color cells in a way that they cover the required number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

### Program Analysis:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by using the formula:
- If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
- Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

Let's evaluate this logic:
- When \( k = 4n - 2 \), the program prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). However, the correct number of cells needed is \( n \), not \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is incorrect.
- For other values of \( k \), the program prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This seems to be an attempt to spread the colored cells across the diagonals, but it doesn't account for the optimal placement of cells to cover the maximum number of diagonals. This is also incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the provided program is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells needed to cover the required number of diagonals.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
