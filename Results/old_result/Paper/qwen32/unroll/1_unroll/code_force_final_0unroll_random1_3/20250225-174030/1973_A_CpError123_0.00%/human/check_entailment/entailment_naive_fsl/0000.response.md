Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Matches**:
   - The program calculates `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`, which is correct because each match contributes 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1+1 for a draw).
   - However, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect. The condition `total_matchs > 3` is not valid because there can be more than 3 matches if there are multiple games between the same pairs of players.
   - The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect because `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` if there are multiple games and draws.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**:
   - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for the distribution of wins and draws.
   - The correct approach involves checking the possible number of draws directly by simulating the games and ensuring that the points can be distributed correctly.

Let's consider a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case**:
```
1
0 2 4
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Explanation**:
- Total points = 0 + 2 + 4 = 6
- Total matches = 6 // 2 = 3
- Possible distribution: Two draws (each contributing 2 points) and one loss/win pair (contributing 2 points).
- Draws = 2

However, the given program will likely output `-1` for this case because the formula for `egalites` does not correctly account for the distribution of points.

Given this analysis, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, so the correctness is False.
