The code snippet initializes a variable `tem` to 1. This does not affect the list `arr` or the list `ans`, which remains an empty list. The variable `tem` will be used in subsequent calculations, but its value is the only change in the given initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1**.
