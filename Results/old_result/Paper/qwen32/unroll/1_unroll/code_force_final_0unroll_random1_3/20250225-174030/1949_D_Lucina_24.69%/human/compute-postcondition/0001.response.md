Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the input (2 <= n <= 24), the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' if i=j. The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. There are at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters in the input; `a` is a list of zeros with length n + 1.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains the same as the integer read from the input, and the input matrix conditions remain unchanged. A new list `a` is created with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to zero.
