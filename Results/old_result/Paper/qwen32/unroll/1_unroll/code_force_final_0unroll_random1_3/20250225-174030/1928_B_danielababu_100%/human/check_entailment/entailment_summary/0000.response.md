### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation to it. Let's break down the provided functions and the main logic to see if they collectively meet the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` is used to read an integer, which is typically the number of test cases (`t`) or the length of the array (`n`) for each test case.
   - `func_3()` is used to read a list of integers, which represents the array `a` for each test case.

2. **Processing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It then creates a sorted list of unique elements from the array `a` using `sorted(list(set(arr)))`.
   - The program iterates over this sorted list of unique elements to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.
   - For each element in the sorted list, it uses `bisect_left` to find the position where the element plus `n` would fit in the sorted list. This helps in counting how many elements can be made equal to a certain value after adding a permutation.
   - It updates the answer `ans` with the maximum count found during these iterations.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum count of equal elements found.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Functions**:
  - `func_1()` and `func_3()` are used appropriately to read the number of test cases and the array elements, respectively.
  - The use of `set` to get unique elements and `sorted` to sort them is correct.
  - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate to find the range of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.
  
- **Logic**:
  - The logic of finding the maximum number of equal elements after adding a permutation is correct. By iterating over the unique sorted elements and using `bisect_left`, the program effectively counts the number of elements that can be made equal to a certain value after adding a permutation.
  - The approach ensures that the program considers all possible values that can be achieved by adding a permutation to the array elements.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided functions and their usage in the main logic, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles the input appropriately, processes the data to find the maximum number of equal elements after adding a permutation, and outputs the result for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
