To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the values of the variables involved in each iteration.

The loop processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads three integers: `A`, `B`, and `C`. Based on these values, it prints a result according to the following logic:
- If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`.
- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A % 2 == 0`, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
- Otherwise, it calculates `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the output for each test case is printed immediately, the final state of the loop is simply that all `t` test cases have been processed and their respective outputs have been printed.

The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state are not directly involved in the loop's logic and do not change during the execution of the loop. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

The output state only involves the results printed for each test case, which are not stored in any variable but are printed to the output.

Output State: **All test cases have been processed and their respective outputs have been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
