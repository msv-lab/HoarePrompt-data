You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasya has two hobbies — adding permutations^{\dagger} to arrays and finding
the most frequently occurring element. Recently, he found an array a and
decided to find out the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in
the array a that he can obtain after adding some permutation to the array a .

More formally, Vasya must choose exactly one permutation p_1, p_2, p_3,
\ldots, p_n of length n , and then change the elements of the array a
according to the rule a_i := a_i + p_i . After that, Vasya counts how many
times each number occurs in the array a and takes the maximum of these values.
You need to determine the maximum value he can obtain.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then
follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum number of elements
equal to the same number after the operation of adding a permutation.

Output

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to choose p = [2, 1] . Then after
applying the operation, the array a will be [3, 3] , in which the number 3
occurs twice, so the answer is 2 .

In the second test case, one of the optimal options is p = [2, 3, 1, 4] .
After applying the operation, the array a will be [9, 4, 5, 5] . Since the
number 5 occurs twice, the answer is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the provided functions and the overall logic correctly solve the problem described. Let's break down the problem and the given code.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation to it. A permutation of length \( n \) is an array consisting of \( n \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) in any order.

### Observations:
1. **Permutation Properties**: A permutation of length \( n \) contains each integer from 1 to \( n \) exactly once.
2. **Objective**: We need to maximize the frequency of any single number in the transformed array \( a_i + p_i \).

### Strategy:
- The goal is to find a permutation that, when added to the array, maximizes the frequency of any number.
- The sum of elements in any permutation of \( \{1, 2, ..., n\} \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
- To maximize the frequency of a number \( x \) in the transformed array, we want as many elements as possible in the original array to be close to \( x - p_i \) for some \( p_i \).

### Correct Approach:
1. **Count Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. **Simulate Permutations**: For each element, simulate the effect of adding the permutation values (from 1 to \( n \)) and track the maximum frequency of any number in the transformed array.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code includes several utility functions for input/output operations and some additional functions that aren't directly related to solving the problem. However, none of the provided functions directly address the core logic needed to solve the problem.

### Missing Logic:
- **Frequency Counting**: The code does not include any logic to count the frequency of elements in the array.
- **Transformation and Frequency Calculation**: The code does not include any logic to simulate the addition of permutations and calculate the resulting frequencies.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. It lacks the core functionality needed to determine the maximum frequency of any number in the transformed array.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. It lacks the core functionality needed to determine the maximum frequency of any number in the transformed array after adding a permutation.
Correctness: **False**
