The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cas_de_test` of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players. It returns a list `resultats` of integers, where each integer is either `-1` or a non-negative integer indicating the number of matches that ended in a draw for each test case. If the conditions for a valid number of draws are not met, `-1` is returned for that test case.
