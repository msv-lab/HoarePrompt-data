### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program. The function `func_1` does not accurately simulate the robot's movement according to the problem statement. The logic in `func_1` checks for specific patterns of arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell (2, n), but it does not cover all possible scenarios of the robot's movement.

Let's analyze the provided counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><>>
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (2, 1) and then follow the arrow to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), it can move to (1, 2) and then follow the arrow to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it can move to (2, 3) and then follow the arrow to (2, 4).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly returns "NO" for this input because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement according to the rules provided in the problem description. The logic in `func_1` is too restrictive and does not account for the robot's ability to move in all possible ways as described.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
