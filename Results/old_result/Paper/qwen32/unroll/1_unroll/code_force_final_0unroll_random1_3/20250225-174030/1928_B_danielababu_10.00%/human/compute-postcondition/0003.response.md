To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `ans` is an initially empty list.
   - `tem` is initialized to 1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last index (`len(arr) - 1`) to the first index (`0`).
   - During each iteration, the current element of `arr` (at index `i`) is multiplied with `tem`, and the result is stored back in `tem`.
   - The updated value of `tem` is then appended to the list `ans`.

3. **Effect on Variables:**
   - `arr` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `tem` will hold the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` as the loop progresses.
   - `ans` will contain the cumulative products in reverse order, starting with the product of all elements and ending with the last element of `arr`.

Let's illustrate with an example:

Suppose `arr = [2, 3, 4]`:
- Initially, `tem = 1` and `ans = []`.
- Iteration 1 (i = 2): `tem = 1 * 4 = 4`, `ans = [4]`.
- Iteration 2 (i = 1): `tem = 4 * 3 = 12`, `ans = [4, 12]`.
- Iteration 3 (i = 0): `tem = 12 * 2 = 24`, `ans = [4, 12, 24]`.

Thus, after all iterations, `ans` contains the cumulative products in reverse order.

**Output State: arr is a list of integers, ans is a list containing the cumulative products of arr in reverse order, tem is the product of all elements in arr.**

Given the generic nature of the input list `arr`, we express the output state as:

Output State: **arr is a list of integers, ans is a list containing the cumulative products of arr in reverse order, tem is the product of all elements in arr.**
