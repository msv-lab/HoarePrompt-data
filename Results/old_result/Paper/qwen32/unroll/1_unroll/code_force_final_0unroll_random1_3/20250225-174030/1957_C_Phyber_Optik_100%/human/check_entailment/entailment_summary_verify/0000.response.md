Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move places a white rook and the computer responds with a black rook in a mirrored position unless the positions are the same. The configurations must be counted modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization of `dp` array and `func_1` function**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007.
   - The function `func_1` is called with an argument of 300000 to precompute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to fill the `dp` array using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
     This formula is known to compute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an \( n \times n \) board without considering any pre-placed rooks or the mirroring rule.

2. **Incorrect calculation of invalid positions**:
   - The program adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set in each iteration. This is incorrect because it does not account for the mirrored positions `(c, r)`.
   - The program does not handle the case where `r == c` correctly. In this case, the computer skips its turn, and the `invalid` set should only include `r`.

3. **Incorrect use of `dp` array**:
   - The `dp` array is used to determine the number of possible final configurations by subtracting the number of invalid positions from `n` and using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This approach is flawed because the `dp` array does not account for the specific constraints of the problem, such as the positions of the already placed rooks and the mirroring rule.

4. **Handling of edge cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `k = 0` or when `n` is very large. For example, if `k = 0`, the program should compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board without any initial moves, which is not correctly handled by the provided code.

5. **Output format**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case on a new line, which is correct.

### Function Summary

The function `func_1` calculates the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard using a dynamic programming approach. However, it does not consider any pre-placed rooks or the mirroring rule, which are critical for solving the problem as described.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is **correct**. The code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to account for the mirrored positions and the specific constraints of the problem, such as the positions of the already placed rooks and the mirroring rule. The `dp` array is precomputed without considering these constraints, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
