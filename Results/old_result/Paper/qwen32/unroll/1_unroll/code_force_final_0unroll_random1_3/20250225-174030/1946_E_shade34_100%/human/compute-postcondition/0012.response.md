Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it returns different results:
- Case_1: If `a` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0).
- Case_2: If `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is 0, it returns the values `d` and `c` which are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)` in that order.
- Case_3: If `a` is greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, and `a` is less than `b`, it returns the tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)).
- Case_4: If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it returns (d, c - a // b * d), where `d` is `b` and `c` is `a % b`.**
