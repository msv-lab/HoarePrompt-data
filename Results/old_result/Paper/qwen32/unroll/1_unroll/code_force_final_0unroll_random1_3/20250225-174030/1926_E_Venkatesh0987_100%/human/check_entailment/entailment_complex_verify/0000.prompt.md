You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: The output is a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of the computation for each test case. The exact values depend on the input values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is greater than half of `n` plus one, it performs a series of calculations involving halving and powers of two to determine the output. Otherwise, it directly computes `2 * k - 1`. The output is a series of integers, each corresponding to a test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description. The program is supposed to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav according to the specified rules. However, there are several issues with the given code that make it incorrect for certain cases.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of the k-th Card:**
   - The code uses a complex logic involving powers of 2 and other calculations to determine the k-th card. However, this logic does not correctly map to the problem's requirements.
   - The problem requires laying down cards in a specific order based on multiples of odd numbers, which the current code does not implement accurately.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where `k` is greater than the number of cards laid down in the initial sequence of odd numbers and their multiples correctly.
   - For example, when `n = 7` and `k = 7`, the correct answer is `4`, but the code does not handle this correctly.

3. **General Logic Flaw:**
   - The code uses a series of while loops and calculations that do not align with the straightforward approach of generating the sequence of cards as described in the problem statement.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Let's consider the case `n = 7` and `k = 7`:
- According to the problem description, the sequence of cards laid down is `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`.
- The 7th card in this sequence is `4`.
- However, the provided code will not output `4` for this input, indicating that the logic is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one should generate the sequence of cards as described and then find the k-th card in that sequence. Here's a simplified version of the correct approach:

```python
def find_kth_card(n, k):
    cards = []
    multiplier = 1
    while len(cards) < n:
        for i in range(1, n + 1, 2):
            card = multiplier * i
            if card <= n:
                cards.append(card)
        multiplier += 1
    return cards[k - 1]

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(find_kth_card(n, k))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This approach correctly generates the sequence of cards and finds the k-th card as required by the problem description. Therefore, the original code is incorrect due to its flawed logic and incorrect handling of the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the incorrect output for certain test cases, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.
