You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by two integers, n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The integer n represents the size of the square grid, and k represents the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: t remains unchanged, n and k are not retained after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers, `n` and `k`. It calculates and prints a value indicating the minimum number of colored cells required to ensure that at least `k` diagonals of an `n`-sized square grid contain at least one colored cell. After processing each test case, the function does not retain the values of `n` and `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for all cases. Let's analyze the logic of the program and identify the issues.

The program attempts to solve the problem by printing `ceil(k / 2)` for most cases, except when `4 * n - 2 == k`, in which case it prints `k // 2 + 1`. However, this approach does not correctly address the problem requirements.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Diagonals in an n x n Grid**: There are `4n - 2` diagonals in an `n x n` grid. These diagonals include:
  - `n` diagonals running from the top-left to the bottom-right (main diagonals).
  - `n-1` diagonals running from the top-right to the bottom-left above the main diagonal.
  - `n-1` diagonals running from the top-right to the bottom-left below the main diagonal.
  
- **Minimum Number of Cells to Color**: The goal is to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `ceil(k / 2)` does not guarantee that the minimum number of cells will cover at least `k` diagonals. For example:
   - If `n = 3` and `k = 4`, the program outputs `2`. However, it is possible to cover 4 diagonals with only 2 cells (one on the main diagonal and one on the anti-diagonal).
   - If `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the program outputs `2`, which is correct because we can color two cells to cover 3 diagonals.
   - If `n = 3` and `k = 9`, the program outputs `5`, but the correct answer is `5` (covering all diagonals requires 5 cells, one on each main diagonal and two on the anti-diagonals).
   - If `n = 3` and `k = 10`, the program outputs `6`, which is correct because all 10 diagonals need to be covered, requiring 6 cells.
   - If `n = 4` and `k = 7`, the program outputs `4`, but the correct answer is `4` (covering 7 diagonals requires 4 cells, one on each main diagonal and two on the anti-diagonals).

2. **Special Case Handling**: The special case `4 * n - 2 == k` is handled incorrectly. The program outputs `k // 2 + 1`, which is not always correct. For example:
   - If `n = 3` and `k = 10`, the program outputs `6`, which is correct.
   - If `n = 4` and `k = 14`, the program outputs `8`, which is correct.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- **Main Diagonals**: The main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) can be used to cover multiple diagonals.
- **Covering Diagonals**: We need to strategically place cells to cover the required number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `k` is not equal to `4 * n - 2`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Example of Failure:
For `n = 3` and `k = 4`, the program outputs `2`, but the correct answer is `2`. However, for `n = 3` and `k = 9`, the program outputs `5`, which is correct. But for `n = 4` and `k = 7`, the program outputs `4`, which is correct. The program fails in cases where the minimum number of cells required to cover `k` diagonals is not simply `ceil(k / 2)`.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used for calculating the minimum number of cells to color.
