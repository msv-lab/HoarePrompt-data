Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s` and prints this count. The input parameters `t`, `n`, and `s` are not altered, but their values determine the number of test cases and the strings to be processed.**
