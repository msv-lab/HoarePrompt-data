Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each element being either 0 or 1 with at least one 1 in the list). For each test case, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in the list `a`.**
