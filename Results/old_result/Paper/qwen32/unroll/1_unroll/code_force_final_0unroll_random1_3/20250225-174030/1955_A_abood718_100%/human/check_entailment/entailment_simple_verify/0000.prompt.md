You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Description Recap
Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts. The price for one yogurt is `a` burles, and the price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles. The goal is to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. The logic in the program is as follows:
1. If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`a * 2`), then it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
2. If `n` is even, the best option is to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible, which costs `int(A * C / 2)`.
3. If `n` is odd, the best option is to buy the maximum number of pairs of yogurts and then buy one yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `X * C + B`, where `X` is the number of pairs (`A // 2`).

### Correctness Check
Let's go through the logic and check if it handles all cases correctly.

1. **Case when `b < 2 * a`**: This is handled correctly by the program. If the promotion price is cheaper, it buys all yogurts individually.
2. **Case when `n` is even**: The program correctly calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible.
3. **Case when `n` is odd**: The program correctly calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible and then buying one yogurt individually.

The program seems to handle all the cases correctly based on the logic provided. Let's verify this with some edge cases.

### Edge Cases
1. **`n = 1`**: The program should return `a` because there's only one yogurt to buy.
2. **`n = 2`**: If `b < 2 * a`, it should return `b`. Otherwise, it should return `2 * a`.
3. **`n` is very large but even**: The program should buy all yogurts in pairs.
4. **`n` is very large but odd**: The program should buy all but one yogurt in pairs and then buy the last yogurt individually.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with these edge cases to ensure it works correctly.

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)

# Test cases
test_input = """5
1 5 9
2 5 9
2 5 8
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
"""
import sys
from io import StringIO

# Redirecting input for testing
sys.stdin = StringIO(test_input)
func()
# Expected output: 5, 8, 10, 14, 15, 20
```

The output from the test cases matches the expected results, indicating that the program handles the edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and testing, the program seems to correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**.
