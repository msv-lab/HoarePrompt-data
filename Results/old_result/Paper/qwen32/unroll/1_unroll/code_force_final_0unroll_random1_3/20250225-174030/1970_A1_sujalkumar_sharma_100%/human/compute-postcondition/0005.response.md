The code sorts the `prefix_balance` list based on two criteria: the first element of each tuple (the balance before processing the character), and the second element of each tuple (the index of the character) in descending order. The `balance` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_balance` is sorted by the balance before processing the character and then by the index of the character in descending order; `balance` is 0.**
