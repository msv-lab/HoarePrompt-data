#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list containing multiple test cases, where each test case is represented as a list. Each test case list starts with two integers n and k, followed by n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. Here, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is the number of test cases, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 is the number of cows, 1 ≤ k ≤ n is the index of the cow owned by the user, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 are the distinct Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `a` containing multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a list starting with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function determines and returns a value based on the ratings relative to the cow at index `k`. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, an index minus one, or the maximum or minimum of certain differences between indices, depending on the conditions met during execution.
