The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. The code does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state (`n` and `k`), so their values remain unchanged. After executing the code, `t` will hold the integer value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
