### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then tries to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90Â° rotation of the other.

The key observation is that Bob can form a new rectangle if at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) is even. This is because:
- If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size \(a/2 \times b\), which can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \(a \times b/2\).
- Similarly, if \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size \(a \times b/2\), which can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \(a/2 \times b\).

If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then any cut will result in two rectangles with at least one odd dimension each, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle of different dimensions.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
Let's break down the logic of the provided program and compare it with the correct approach:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Conditions in the Program:**
   - **Condition 1:**
     ```python
     if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
         print('yes')
     ```
     - This condition checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. If true, it prints "yes".
     - **Correctness:** This is correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
   
   - **Condition 2:**
     ```python
     elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
         print('no')
     ```
     - This condition is syntactically incorrect and logically flawed. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` creates a tuple `(True/False, a)` which is always truthy, and the same applies to `(b - a == -b, b)`.
     - **Correctness:** This condition is incorrect and will not work as intended.
   
   - **Condition 3:**
     ```python
     elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
         print('yes')
     ```
     - This condition checks if the difference \(a - b\) is non-zero. Since any non-zero integer will satisfy this condition, it will always print "yes" for any \(a \neq b\).
     - **Correctness:** This condition is incorrect. It does not correctly determine whether a new rectangle can be formed.
   
   - **Condition 4:**
     ```python
     else:
         print('no')
     ```
     - This condition handles the case where \(a = b\) and both are odd.
     - **Correctness:** This is correct. If \(a = b\) and both are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct logic should be:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, print "yes".
- Otherwise, print "no".

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases due to the flawed conditions. The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
