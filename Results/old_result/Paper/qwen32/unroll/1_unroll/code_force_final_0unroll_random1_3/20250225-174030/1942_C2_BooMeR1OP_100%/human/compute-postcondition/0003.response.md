Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given inputs. Specifically, Case_1: If the conditions are met, it returns a specific value or result for that test case; otherwise, it handles the inputs as per the problem's requirements.** 

Since the exact output for each test case is not specified in the provided information, the functionality is described in a general manner based on the given constraints and relationships.
