### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and function summaries to determine whether the original assessment is correct or not.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Scope and Variable Access:**
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is indeed not defined within `func_2`, but it is defined outside. However, the variable `a` and `ops` are not passed as parameters to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to a `NameError`. This part of the assessment is correct.

2. **Modification of `a` and `ops`:**
   - Since `a` and `ops` are not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, the modifications made to them within `recursive_maximize_sum` and `func_1` are not reflected back in `func_2`. This is a critical issue.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. Specifically, `func_1` sets `a[l]` to 0 when `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, which is incorrect as the goal is to maximize the sum.
   - The MEX value is not correctly computed. Instead, the code sets the subarray to `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, which is not the correct approach.
   - The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` that checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is irrelevant and incorrect.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Maximum Value:**
   - The incorrect handling of the maximum value in the subarray (`pos == l` or `pos == r`) is noted, which suggests that the function does not correctly process the entire array.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` is the main function that reads input and prints the result, but it relies on the incorrect logic in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.

#### Function Summary:

The function summary provided for `func_3` is incorrect. It states that `func_3` calculates the sum `s` and the maximum `m` of the list `a`, but the code does not actually calculate the maximum `m` (number of operations). Instead, it calculates the sum `s` and the number of operations performed.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the code. The code has several logical errors and scope issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. The function summaries provided do not accurately reflect the behavior of the code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
