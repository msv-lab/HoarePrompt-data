Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves starting from no cubes.

Here are the possible scenarios:
1. **If `m > n`**: It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves because each move can add at most 1 cube.
2. **If `n == m`**: It's possible to have exactly `m` cubes, as Nikita can simply add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves.
3. **If `m == n - 1`**: It's possible to have exactly `m` cubes. Nikita can add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves except for one move where he removes a cube.
4. **If `m < n - 1`**: It's also possible to have exactly `m` cubes. Nikita can add cubes for some moves and remove cubes for others, as long as the net addition is `m` cubes. The parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m` does not directly determine the possibility unless `m` is `n-1` or `m > n`.

Let's review the program's logic:
- It checks if `n == m` and prints "Yes" if true.
- It checks if `m > n` and prints "No" if true.
- It checks if `m == n - 1` and prints "Yes" if true.
- It then checks if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd and prints "Yes" if true.
- Otherwise, it prints "No".

The last two conditions (`m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`) are incorrect because they don't account for all valid cases where `m < n - 1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, the program will print "No" because `m` and `n` have different parities, but it is actually possible (add 1 cube 3 times and remove 1 cube 2 times).

Thus, the program is incorrect due to these conditions.

Correctness: **False**
