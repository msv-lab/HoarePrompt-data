You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The length of the list s (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in s does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: The list `s` will have characters replaced by those in `unique_chars` in reverse order if they were present initially, and new characters will be added to `unique_chars` and kept in `s`. The list `unique_chars` will contain all unique characters from `s` in the order they were first encountered, with new characters added to the beginning.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all unique characters from the list `s` in reverse order of their first encounter in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a list of strings. Each string in the list consists of lowercase Latin letters, with each string's length ranging from 1 to 200,000 characters. The length of the list `s` ranges from 1 to 10,000, and the total sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 200,000 characters. The function returns a string that contains all unique characters from the list `s` in reverse order of their first appearance in the list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all unique characters from the list `s` in reverse order of their first encounter in `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
