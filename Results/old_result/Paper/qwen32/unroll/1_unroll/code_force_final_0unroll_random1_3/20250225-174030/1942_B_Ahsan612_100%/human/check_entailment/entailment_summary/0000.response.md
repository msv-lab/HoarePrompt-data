### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`, where each element in `a` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX (minimum excludant) function returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given set of numbers.

The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating over the array `a` in reverse order and calculating each element of `p` using the formula `p_i = MEX - a_i`. The variable `mex` is initialized to `n` and is updated to the minimum of its current value and `mex - a_i` after each iteration.

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Initialization of `mex`:**
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the permutation. This is a reasonable starting point because the MEX of an empty set is `0`, and the MEX of a set containing all numbers from `0` to `n-1` is `n`.

2. **Iterating in Reverse:**
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. This approach makes sense because it allows us to compute the MEX for the suffix of the permutation `p` that has not yet been constructed. By iterating in reverse, the program can correctly compute the MEX for the current suffix and use it to determine the next element in `p`.

3. **Updating `mex`:**
   - After computing each element of `p` using `p_i = mex - a_i`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly computed `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

Given that the problem guarantees that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data, and the provided program correctly constructs such a permutation by iterating in reverse and updating the MEX, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
