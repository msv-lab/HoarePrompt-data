`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The grid, `n`, and `m` are still described as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500. The grid is represented by a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing only the characters 'W' and 'B'. The sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
