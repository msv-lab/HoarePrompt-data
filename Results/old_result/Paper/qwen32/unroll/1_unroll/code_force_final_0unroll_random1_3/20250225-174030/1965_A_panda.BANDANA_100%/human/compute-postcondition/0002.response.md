Output State: **The output state is determined by the results of each test case. For each test case, the program prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `test` are local to each iteration and do not persist after the loop completes.**
