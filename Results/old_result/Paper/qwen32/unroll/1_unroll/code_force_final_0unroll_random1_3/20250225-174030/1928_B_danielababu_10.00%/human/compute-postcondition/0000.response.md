Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, and the function calculates the cumulative product of the elements in reverse order, storing the results in a new list `ans`; `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The list `arr` and the function's purpose remain unchanged.
