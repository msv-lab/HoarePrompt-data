The function `func_12` calculates a rank value for a given key `da` in the dictionary `d` by recursively processing the values associated with `da`. If the list associated with `da` contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it updates the `rank` list at index `da - 1` with the minimum rank value obtained from recursive calls plus one and returns this value.
