Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in the sorting key used in the `sort` function. The problem description specifies that the columns should be sorted in increasing order of prefix balance and, in case of ties, in decreasing order of position. However, the current implementation sorts in increasing order of prefix balance and increasing order of position (due to `-x[1]` which should be `x[1]` with a reverse sort or `-(x[1])`).

To fix this, the sorting key should be adjusted to sort by prefix balance in ascending order and position in descending order. Here is the corrected version of the sorting key:

```python
prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
```

However, to make it more explicit and less prone to errors, you can use the `reverse` parameter for the second key:

```python
prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]), reverse=True)
```

But since we want the second key to be in descending order and the first in ascending, the correct way is:

```python
prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
```

So the original code is almost correct, but the explanation of the sorting key is not. The code itself sorts correctly as intended, but the comment or explanation about the sorting key being `x[1]` with a reverse sort or `-(x[1])` is misleading. Therefore, the program is logically correct based on its implementation, but the description of the sorting key in the comment is incorrect.

Given the task is to determine if the program is correct based on the provided problem description, and considering the code does perform the intended operation, the response would be:

Correctness: **True**
