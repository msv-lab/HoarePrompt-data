In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `n` and `m` are mentioned as part of the context for each test case, but they are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is defined by `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is not a concern before the loop starts because `i` is assigned by the `range` function during each iteration.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `t`, which must be greater than 0. The values of `n` and `m` do not affect the execution of the loop itself and are not part of the loop's head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is not relevant before the loop starts**.

However, since `t` is already given to be in the range 1 to 100 (inclusive), it is already ensured that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Final State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100**.
