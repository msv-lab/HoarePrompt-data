To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what happens within the loop. The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it does the following:
- Reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- Calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner and stores the result in the variable `winner`.
- Appends the result `winner` to the list `results`.

Since `results` is the only variable that gets modified inside the loop, and it is initially an empty list, after `t` iterations, `results` will contain the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of `a` and `b` read from the input.

The values of `a` and `b` at the end of the loop will be the last pair of values read from the input, as they are overwritten in each iteration.

The output state can be described as follows:
- `a` and `b` will hold the values from the last test case.
- `t` will remain unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- `results` will contain the list of winners for each test case.

Given the format, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the values from the last test case, `t` is unchanged, `results` is a list containing the winners for each test case.**
