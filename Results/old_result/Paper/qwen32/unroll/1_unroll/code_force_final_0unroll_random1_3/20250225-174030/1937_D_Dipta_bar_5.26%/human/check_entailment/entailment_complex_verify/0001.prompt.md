You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing movements in a one-dimensional grid where '<' indicates moving one unit to the left and '>' indicates moving one unit to the right. The function prints a sequence of integers based on the cumulative effect of these movements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Grid and Pinball Movement:**
   - The grid consists of cells each containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right depending on the character in the cell.
   - After moving, the character in the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Queries:**
   - For each cell (1 to n), we need to determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball placed there to leave the grid.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output n integers representing the time for each pinball starting from each cell.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a grid of length `n` and a string `s` representing the initial state of the grid.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, two arrays `A` and `B` are used to keep track of the cumulative movements for '>' and '<' respectively.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` store the indices of '>' and '<' respectively.

3. **Calculating Movements:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative movements for '>' in `A` and '<' in `B`.
   - It uses the indices stored in `idx_A` and `idx_B` to compute the movements.

4. **Determining Exit Times:**
   - For each cell, the program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to exit the grid.
   - It uses the cumulative movements stored in `A` and `B` to compute the exit times.
   - The logic involves checking the direction of movement (`'>'` or `'<'`), updating the indices, and calculating the total time based on the movements.

### Correctness Check

The program uses a complex approach to calculate the exit times, involving cumulative movements and index manipulations. However, the logic is intricate and not straightforward to verify without a detailed step-by-step simulation of the pinball movements for each test case.

Given the complexity and the need for precise handling of movements and index updates, it's challenging to confirm the correctness solely based on the provided code. The program seems to follow the problem requirements but might have edge cases or logical errors that aren't immediately apparent.

### Conclusion

While the program appears to be structured correctly based on the problem description, without a thorough simulation and testing against all possible edge cases, it's difficult to definitively state its correctness.

However, given the constraints and the problem's complexity, the program seems to be attempting to solve the problem efficiently. Therefore, based on the provided code and problem requirements, we can tentatively assume it to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
