The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` within the range of 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of a secret permutation `p`. It prints a formatted string `! [a] [b]` and flushes the output. The function does not return a value explicitly, but the annotation suggests it is intended to compare elements `p[a]` and `p[b]` in the permutation `p` and return -1, 0, or 1 based on their comparison. However, based on the actual code, the function only prints and flushes the output without performing the comparison or returning a value.
