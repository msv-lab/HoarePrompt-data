### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The given program does not guarantee that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. Let's break down the issues in the provided code and the function summary.

The program's approach is to distribute 'F' and 'S' based on the initial counts of 'F' and 'S' in the input matrix. Specifically, it prioritizes assigning 'F' to nodes with more 'F' connections and 'S' to nodes with more 'S' connections, and then assigns the remaining '?' cells based on a heuristic involving the first `n // 4` rows or columns identified as having only 'F' or only 'S'. However, this strategy does not ensure that the constraint of having no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met for every possible permutation of scenarios.

Let's revisit the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
5
.FF??
F.F??
FF?.?
??.??
???.?
```

**Output from the code:**
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.FF
FFF.?
FF?.?
```

**Explanation of the issue:**
- For the permutation (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the sequence of transitions is "FFF", which violates the constraint because \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) and we have 3 consecutive 'F's.
- The code does not ensure that the constraint is met for all permutations, which is a requirement of the problem.

The function summary correctly identifies the approach taken by the code but does not address the critical flaw: the code does not guarantee the required constraint for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final: **False**
