### Reasoning:
The program aims to determine the minimum number of operations required to move chips in a ribbon so that they form a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. The provided solution works by finding the first and last occurrence of a chip ('1') in the ribbon configuration and then counting the number of free cells ('0') between these two positions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads `t` (number of test cases) and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of cells) and the ribbon configuration as a string of '0's and '1's.
2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**: It uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip ('1') and `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip ('1'). The latter is done by reversing the string and finding the first '1', which corresponds to the last '1' in the original string.
3. **Counting Free Cells**: It slices the string from the first '1' to the last '1' (inclusive) and counts the number of '0's in this substring. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a contiguous block.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the first example provided:
- **Input**: `8 \n 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- **First '1'**: Index 1
- **Last '1'**: Index 6 (from the end, i.e., 8-2=6 in original indexing)
- **Substring**: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
- **Number of '0's**: 1

This matches the expected output of `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block. The execution summary aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.
