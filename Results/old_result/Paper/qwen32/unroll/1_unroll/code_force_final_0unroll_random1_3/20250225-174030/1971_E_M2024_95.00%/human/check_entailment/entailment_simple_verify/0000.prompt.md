You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis

The problem involves calculating the time it takes for a car to reach a specific point `d` on a number line, given the car's known positions and the times it reaches those positions. The program uses binary search (via `bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment where the point `d` lies, calculates the speed for that segment, and then computes the time based on that speed.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Handling of Input and Output**: The program reads multiple test cases, each with its own set of parameters and queries.
2. **Calculation of Speeds**: The program calculates the speed between each pair of adjacent points.
3. **Binary Search for Segments**: The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which the query point `d` lies.
4. **Time Calculation**: The program calculates the time to reach `d` based on the speed of the segment and the distance within that segment.

### Potential Issues

1. **Edge Cases**: The program should correctly handle edge cases such as `d` being exactly at a known point, or `d` being 0.
2. **Speed Calculation**: The program should correctly handle cases where the speed between segments is zero (though the problem description implies that speeds will be positive).
3. **Precision**: The program should correctly handle floating-point arithmetic and ensure that the final time is rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided example and consider edge cases:

#### Example Test Case

**Input:**
```
4
10 1 3
10
10
0
6
7
10 2 4
4 10
4 7
6
4
2
7
1000000000 1 1
1000000000
1000000000
99999999
6 1 3
6
5
2
6
5
```

**Output:**
```
0 6 7 
5 4 2 5 
99999999 
1 5 4 
```

The program produces the correct output for the given example.

#### Edge Cases

1. **d = 0**: The program correctly returns 0 when `d` is 0.
2. **d = a_i**: The program correctly returns `b_i` when `d` is exactly at a known point.
3. **d between a_i and a_{i+1}**: The program correctly calculates the time for points between known points.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and testing it with the provided example and edge cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all specified scenarios without any issues. The code uses appropriate data structures and algorithms to efficiently compute the required times for each query.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles the input and performs the necessary calculations to determine the time it takes for the car to reach each query point `d`. It uses binary search to find the relevant segment and correctly computes the time based on the speed of that segment. The program handles edge cases such as `d` being exactly at a known point or `d` being 0, and it correctly rounds down the final time to the nearest integer.
