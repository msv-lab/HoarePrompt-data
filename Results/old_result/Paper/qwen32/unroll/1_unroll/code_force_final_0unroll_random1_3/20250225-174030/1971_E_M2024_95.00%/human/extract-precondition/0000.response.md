Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that k <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5. a is a list of k integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, and a_k = n. b is a list of k integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. d is a list of q integers where 0 <= d <= n. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
