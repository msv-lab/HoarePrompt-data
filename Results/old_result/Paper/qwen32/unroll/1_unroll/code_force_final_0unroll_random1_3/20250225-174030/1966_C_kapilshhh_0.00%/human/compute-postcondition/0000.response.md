The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The value of `t` is now known and will be used in subsequent processing.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); the number of piles `n` and the number of stones in each pile `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case are still to be read.**
