Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to determine the closest city for each city. This function is supposed to return a list where each element at index `i` represents the cost to travel to the closest city from city `i+1`.
   - The function calculates the closest city by comparing the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - If the next city is closer, it assigns `1` to `prog_cities[i]`. Otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city (`abs(forward - cities[i])`).

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both forward and backward travel costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to travel to the next city using the closest city rule from the start to each city.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost to travel to the previous city using the closest city rule from the end to each city.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program determines the cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses `pref_sum_f` to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses `pref_sum_b` to calculate the cost.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Closest City Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the cost to travel to the closest city.
   - The problem statement requires the cost to travel to the closest city to be `1` coin, not the distance to the next city.
   - The function should always assign `1` to `prog_cities[i]` when the next city is closer, but it should also correctly assign `1` when the previous city is closer.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums are calculated correctly based on the incorrect costs provided by `func_1`.
   - Therefore, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - Since the prefix sums are incorrect, the program will output incorrect results for the queries.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the closest city calculation and the subsequent prefix sum calculation, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
