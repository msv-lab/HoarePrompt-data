To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, n)`. This means we can only adjust `i` and `n` to ensure the loop executes.

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: This is the loop variable that will take values from `0` to `n-1`. Before the loop starts, `i` should not be initialized because it is automatically set to `0` at the start of the loop.
2. **`n`**: This is the upper bound of the range. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`. The current state specifies that `n` is not equal to `2`, but it does not specify whether `n` is greater than `0` or less than `0`. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than `0`.

### Adjustments:
- `n` must be greater than `0` to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically set by the loop.

### State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `max_index` is 0, `min_indices` is [0]**
