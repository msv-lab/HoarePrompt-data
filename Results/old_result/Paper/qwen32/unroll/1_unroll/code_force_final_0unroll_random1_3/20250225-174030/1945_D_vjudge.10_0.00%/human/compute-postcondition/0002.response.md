The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The current state does not specify the value of `x`, so we need to adjust it to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `custos` is an empty list; `i` is 0**
