The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `mex`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n; `mex` is an empty list.**
