The code snippet initializes a list `cnt_b` with `max_val + 1` zeros. Given that `max_val` is 1,000,000, `cnt_b` will be a list of 1,000,001 zeros.

Here's the Output State:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6. `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `max_val` is 1000000. `cnt_b` is a list of 1,000,001 zeros.**
