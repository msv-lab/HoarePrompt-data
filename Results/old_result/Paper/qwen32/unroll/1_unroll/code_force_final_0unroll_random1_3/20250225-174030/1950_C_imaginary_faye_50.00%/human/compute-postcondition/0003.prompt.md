You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is a two-digit string representing the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is a two-digit string representing the minute from 00 to 59.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, the output will be a string in the format "hh:mm [AM/PM]", where "hh" is the hour converted to a 12-hour format, "mm" remains the same, and "[AM/PM]" indicates whether the time is in the AM or PM period.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1440. For each test case, it receives a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", representing a time. The function returns the processed results based on the given times.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
