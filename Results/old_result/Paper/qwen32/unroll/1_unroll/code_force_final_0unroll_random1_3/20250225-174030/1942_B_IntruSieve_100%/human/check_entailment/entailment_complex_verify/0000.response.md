### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided code does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning step by step.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) for each \( i \).
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to construct \( p \) as follows:
1. For each element in \( a \), if \( a_i \) is positive, it appends the current MEX to \( p \).
2. If \( a_i \) is non-positive, it appends \( \text{abs}(a_i - \text{minn}) \) to \( p \).

However, this logic does not guarantee that the constructed \( p \) will satisfy the condition \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Determine the MEX of the current prefix of \( p \).
2. Ensure that \( p_i \) is such that \( a_i = \text{MEX} - p_i \).

Let's consider the provided example:
- Input: `5`, `1 1 -2 1 2`
- Expected Output: `0 1 4 2 3`

For \( i = 1 \):
- \( a_1 = 1 \)
- MEX of \( p_1 \) (initially empty) is `0`
- \( p_1 \) should be `0` because \( 1 = 0 - (-1) \) is incorrect, instead, we need to find \( p_1 \) such that \( 1 = \text{MEX} - p_1 \), which gives \( p_1 = 0 \).

For \( i = 2 \):
- \( a_2 = 1 \)
- MEX of \( p_1 \) is `1`
- \( p_2 \) should be `1` because \( 1 = 1 - 0 \).

For \( i = 3 \):
- \( a_3 = -2 \)
- MEX of \( p_1, p_2 \) is `2`
- \( p_3 \) should be `4` because \( -2 = 2 - 4 \) is incorrect, instead, we need to find \( p_3 \) such that \( -2 = \text{MEX} - p_3 \), which gives \( p_3 = 4 \).

For \( i = 4 \):
- \( a_4 = 1 \)
- MEX of \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) is `2`
- \( p_4 \) should be `2` because \( 1 = 2 - 1 \).

For \( i = 5 \):
- \( a_5 = 2 \)
- MEX of \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) is `3`
- \( p_5 \) should be `3` because \( 2 = 3 - 1 \) is incorrect, instead, we need to find \( p_5 \) such that \( 2 = \text{MEX} - p_5 \), which gives \( p_5 = 3 \).

The correct code should iteratively determine \( p_i \) by finding the MEX of the current prefix of \( p \) and ensuring that \( a_i = \text{MEX} - p_i \).

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to construct \( p \) as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
