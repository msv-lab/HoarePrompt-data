### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicity of each sign. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it calculates the year in which each sign occurs sequentially.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes `current_year` to 0.
4. For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next occurrence year:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
5. It updates `current_year` to this next occurrence year and continues to the next sign.
6. After processing all signs, it appends the final `current_year` (which is the year of the n-th sign occurrence) to the results list.
7. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic correctly implements the requirement that each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The example provided in the problem description is correctly handled by the program, as demonstrated by the annotated states and the expected output.
