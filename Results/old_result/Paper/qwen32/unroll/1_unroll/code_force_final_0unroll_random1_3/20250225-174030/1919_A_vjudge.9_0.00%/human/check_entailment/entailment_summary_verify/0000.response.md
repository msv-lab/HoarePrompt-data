### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and correctness of the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins. The key insight is that:

- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob will win.
- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice will win.

This is because the parity of the total number of coins will alternate between odd and even after each player's turn. The player who starts with an odd total (Alice) can always force the opponent (Bob) to face an even total, and vice versa. The player who faces an even total will eventually be forced into a position where they cannot make a move, thus losing the game.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function checks the parity of the sum `a + b`.
   - If `a + b` is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If `a + b` is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

   This logic correctly implements the key insight derived from the problem analysis.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function handles input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

   This function correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

#### Function Summary:
The summary for `func_2` correctly describes its behavior: it reads multiple test cases, determines the winner for each based on the logic in `func_1`, and prints the results. The summary aligns with the provided code and the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins and handles multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
