Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It then prints 'NO' if the string contains exactly two distinct characters, otherwise it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smaller of the string and its reverse if the string is not already in lexicographically smallest order.**
