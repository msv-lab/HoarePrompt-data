### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail, using the function summary and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- The key insight is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move changes the number of cubes by 1. Therefore, `n - m` must be even, which means `n % 2 == m % 2`.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions:
  - `n == m`: prints 'Yes'
  - `m > n`: prints 'No'
  - `m == n - 1`: prints 'Yes'
  - `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`: prints 'Yes'
  - `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`: prints 'Yes'
  - Otherwise, prints 'No'

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the program does not correctly handle all possible cases.
- It points out that the condition `m == n - 1` is incorrect and does not cover all cases where the difference `n - m` is even.
- A corrected version of the program should check if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

#### Evaluation:
- The condition `m == n - 1` is indeed incorrect because it does not consider other valid cases where `n - m` is even.
- The conditions `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` are redundant ways of checking that `n % 2 == m % 2`, but they do not cover the case where `n < m`.
- The original program fails for cases where `m < n` and `n - m` is even, which should return 'Yes'.

#### Counterexample:
- Input: `1 2 0`
  - Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add two cubes and then remove all of them to end up with 0 cubes).
  - Program Output: `No` (because it does not correctly handle the case where `n > m` and `n - m` is even).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly, specifically when `m < n` and `n - m` is even.

**Final: False**
