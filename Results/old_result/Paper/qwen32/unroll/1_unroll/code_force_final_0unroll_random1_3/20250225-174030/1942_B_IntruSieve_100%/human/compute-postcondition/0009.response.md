Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Given the loop:

```python
for itm in mex:
    print(itm, end=' ')
```

This loop iterates over each element in the list `mex` and prints it, separated by spaces. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `used` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged. The only change is the printed output, which is the space-separated elements of the `mex` list.

Thus, the output state after the loop has finished executing is:

Output State: **the elements of `mex` printed in a single line, separated by spaces.**
