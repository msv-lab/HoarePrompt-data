### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign occurs every a_i years and must occur sequentially. The provided solution calculates this by iterating through each sign's periodicity and updating the cumulative year accordingly. 

For each sign, the code checks if the current cumulative year (`year`) is a multiple of the sign's periodicity (`ai`). If it is not (i.e., `year % ai` is non-zero), it adds the remainder (`year % ai`) to `year` to reach the next occurrence of the sign. If it is a multiple (i.e., `year % ai` is zero), it simply adds the periodicity (`ai`) to `year`.

Let's break down the logic with an example:

- Suppose we have a sign that occurs every 3 years, and the current cumulative year is 4. Since 4 is not a multiple of 3, we need to wait until the next multiple of 3, which is 6. The code calculates this by adding `4 % 3` (which is 1) to `year`, making it 5, and then adding the remaining 1 to reach 6.

- If the current cumulative year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, we simply add the periodicity to move to the next occurrence. For example, if the current cumulative year is 3 and the sign occurs every 3 years, we add 3 to get the next occurrence at year 6.

This logic correctly implements the requirement that each sign must occur sequentially, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, based on the given problem description and the logic described above.

**Correctness: True**
