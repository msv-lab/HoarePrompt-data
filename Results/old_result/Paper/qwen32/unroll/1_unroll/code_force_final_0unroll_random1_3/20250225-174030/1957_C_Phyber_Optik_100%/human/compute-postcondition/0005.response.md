Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard. It calculates and returns a value based on a dynamic programming approach, specifically the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard modulo 1000000007. The function does not consider any moves `k` or their positions as described in the annotations, as these are not part of the function's actual implementation.**
