Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not guarantee that the output will meet the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type for any permutation of the scenarios. The logic in the program does not effectively handle the constraints and does not ensure that the condition is satisfied for all possible scenario orderings.

Here are some key issues:
1. The program does not consider the full range of possible scenario permutations and the sequences of transition videos that could result.
2. The program does not properly balance the distribution of 'F' and 'S' to ensure that no sequence of more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is created.
3. The logic for appending 'F' or 'S' to undecided transitions (denoted by '?') is not robust enough to handle all cases and ensure compliance with the problem constraints.

To solve the problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, possibly involving backtracking or a more detailed analysis of the constraints to ensure that the sequence of transition videos is always valid for any permutation of scenarios.
