To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to verify that the `queue` is not empty when the loop starts. According to the provided state, the `queue` already contains a single tuple `(start, 0)`. Therefore, the `queue` is not empty, and the loop can certainly execute one time.

Since the `queue` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute, we do not need to adjust any of the states.

State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, both within the range of 1 to n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node.**
