The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer result based on the specific conditions involving `n` and `k`. The result is determined by whether `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, equal to `4 * n - 3`, or equal to `4 * n - 2`.
