Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, it accepts a binary string `s` such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The function returns the result for each test case based on the binary string provided.**
