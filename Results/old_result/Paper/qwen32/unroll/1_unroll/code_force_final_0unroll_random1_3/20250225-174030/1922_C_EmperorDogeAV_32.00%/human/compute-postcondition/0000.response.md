The code snippet initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n - 1` zeros. This means that the length of `prog_cities` is determined by the number of cities `n`, specifically it will have one less element than the number of cities.

Given the initial state, the list `cities` remains unchanged, and the new list `prog_cities` is created with `n - 1` zeros.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i) representing the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.**
