### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. The program provided calculates this by using combinatorial mathematics, specifically calculating binomial coefficients modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Factorials Calculation**:
   - The program calculates factorials up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores them in the `facts` list. This is done to efficiently compute binomial coefficients later.
   
2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m1`, `m2`, the list of prefix maximum indices `p`, and the list of suffix maximum indices `s`.

3. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, it immediately returns 0 as no valid permutation can exist.

4. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid permutations using the binomial coefficient, which is computed using the precomputed factorials.
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums to compute the number of ways to arrange the elements between the maximums.
   - The binomial coefficient is calculated using the `func_2` function, which in turn uses the `func_1` function to compute the modular multiplicative inverse.

5. **Output**:
   - The result for each test case is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Function Analysis:

- **`func_1` (Extended Euclidean Algorithm)**:
  - This function calculates the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `a*x + b*y = gcd(a, b)`.
  - It is used to find the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **`func_2` (Modular Division)**:
  - This function calculates `(a / b) % (10^9 + 7)` by using the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` obtained from `func_1`.

### Correctness Verification:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions. The use of combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct for the problem constraints.

The validation step ensures that the input conditions are met, and the combinatorial calculations correctly count the number of valid permutations.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correctly implemented and should produce the correct results for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
