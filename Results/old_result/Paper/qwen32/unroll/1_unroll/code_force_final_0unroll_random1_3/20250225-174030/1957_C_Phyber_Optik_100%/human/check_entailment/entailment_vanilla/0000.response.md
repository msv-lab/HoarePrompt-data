To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it aligns with the problem description and requirements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes a list `dp` with a size of 300007 and precomputes values up to index 300000 using the `func_1` function.
   - The `dp` array is supposed to hold the number of possible final configurations for a given board size `n` after all valid moves are made.
   - The `func_1` function calculates the values using the recurrence relation:
     - `dp[1] = 1`
     - `dp[2] = 3`
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for `i >= 3`

2. **Reading Input and Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of already occupied rows and columns.
   - The number of remaining valid moves is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The program prints the value from the `dp` array at the index `n - len(invalid)` to determine the number of possible final configurations.

### Verification of the Approach:

- **Recurrence Relation**:
  - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks attack each other.
  - The relation accounts for placing a rook in a new row/column and the subsequent valid configurations that can be formed.

- **Handling of Invalid Moves**:
  - The program correctly identifies and excludes already occupied rows and columns by adding them to the `invalid` set.
  - It calculates the number of remaining valid positions as `n - len(invalid)`.

- **Output**:
  - The program outputs the number of possible final configurations from the `dp` array, which has been precomputed for all possible board sizes up to 300000.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It precomputes the number of possible configurations for different board sizes and uses this precomputed data to efficiently solve each test case. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
