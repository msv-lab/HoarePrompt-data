Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of problems Vlad needs to create. Specifically, the program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level across all rounds, rather than ensuring that each round has at least one problem of each difficulty level.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:
- The program calculates the frequency of each difficulty level in the bank of problems.
- It then calculates how many problems are missing for each difficulty level across all rounds.
- However, what is actually required is to ensure that each of the `m` rounds has at least one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. This means that for each round, Vlad needs to have one of each difficulty level, and the program should account for this requirement per round.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that for each round, we check if we have at least one problem of each difficulty level. If not, we need to count how many more problems are needed to fulfill this requirement for all rounds.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:
        list: List of results, one for each test case.
    """
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        # Calculate the number of additional problems needed
        additional_problems = 0
        for f in freq:
            if f < m:
                additional_problems += m - f
        results.append(additional_problems)
    return results

# Example usage
t = 3
test_cases = [(10, 1, 'BGECDCBDED'), (10, 2, 'BGECDCBDED'), (9, 1, 'BBCDEFFGG')]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

With this correction, the program should produce the correct output for the given examples.
