The `while` loop in the given program is `while t:`. This loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is non-zero. Therefore, for the first iteration of the loop to proceed, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this condition is already satisfied because `t` is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 10^4, which means it is always greater than 0.

Since the condition for the loop to execute is already met with the given constraints, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t`. The states of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` distinct integers do not affect the execution of the `while` loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
