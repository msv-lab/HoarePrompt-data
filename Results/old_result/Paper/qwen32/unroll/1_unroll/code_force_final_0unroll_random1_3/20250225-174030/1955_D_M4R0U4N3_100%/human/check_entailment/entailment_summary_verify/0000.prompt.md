You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`, and two integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it calculates how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements that also appear in list `b`. The result for each test case is printed, indicating the count of such subarrays.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program seems to correctly implement the logic to count the number of good subsegments in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `max_val` is set to 1,000,000 to accommodate the maximum possible value of elements in arrays `a` and `b`.
   - `cnt_b` is initialized as an array of zeros with a length of `max_val + 1` to count occurrences of each element in `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   - Arrays `a` and `b` are read.
   - The `cnt_b` array is updated to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.
   - A set `b_values` is created from `b` to quickly check if an element is in `b`.

3. **Counting Matches for the First Subsegment**:
   - The program counts how many elements in the first subsegment of `a` (of length `m`) are in `b` and can be matched with elements in `b` (considering their counts).
   - If this count (`curr`) is at least `k`, the subsegment is considered good, and `ans` is incremented.

4. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count matches for subsequent subsegments.
   - For each new subsegment, it updates the count of the element that is sliding out of the window and the count of the element that is sliding into the window.
   - If the updated count of matches (`curr`) is at least `k`, the subsegment is considered good, and `ans` is incremented.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments for the current test case, the program prints the number of good subsegments.

The provided code handles the sliding window efficiently and updates the counts correctly, ensuring that it works for all possible cases within the given constraints. The logic also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `k` is equal to `m` (all elements in the subsegment must match elements in `b`), and when `k` is 1 (at least one element in the subsegment must match an element in `b`).

The program also resets the `cnt_b` array for each test case to ensure that the counts do not carry over between test cases. This is important given the large number of test cases and the need to maintain accurate counts for each individual case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
