Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string `s` and prints this count. However, this approach does not necessarily give the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings, but it does not consider overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid these substrings. For example, in the string "mapie", the program would count 2 occurrences ('map' and 'pie'), but removing just 1 character (the 'a') would make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
