The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over is determined by `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`. The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are not relevant to whether the loop will execute or not.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since the problem statement already specifies that `1 <= t <= 10^5`, this condition is already satisfied. Thus, no adjustment is required for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets**
