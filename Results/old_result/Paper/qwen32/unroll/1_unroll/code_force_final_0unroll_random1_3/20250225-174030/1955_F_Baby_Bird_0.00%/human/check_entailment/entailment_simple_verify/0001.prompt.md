You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, and p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: 3, 4, 5, 6



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

**Objective:** Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally from a sequence of integers, where Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero, and Bob wins otherwise.

**Key Points:**
- The sequence consists of integers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Eve removes one number in each round.
- Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
- Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins.

**Winning Conditions:**
- XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each bit position in the binary representation of the numbers is even.
- For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, their binary representations are:
  - 1: `01`
  - 2: `10`
  - 3: `11`
  - 4: `100`
- XOR of the sequence is zero if:
  - The count of numbers with the least significant bit set (1, 3) is even.
  - The count of numbers with the second least significant bit set (2, 3, 4) is even.
  - The count of numbers with the third least significant bit set (4) is even.

**Strategy:**
- Eve should aim to maintain an even count for each bit position to ensure Bob wins.
- The optimal strategy involves removing numbers in such a way that the parity of the counts of numbers with specific bits remains even.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Processing Counts:**
   - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`:
     - This line attempts to adjust the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
     - The lambda function `lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2` effectively rounds down each count to the nearest even number.
     - This operation does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.

3. **Determine Bob's Wins:**
   - `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)`:
     - The first part `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s have an odd parity.
     - If all three counts are odd, this part evaluates to `1`; otherwise, it evaluates to `0`.
     - The second part `sum(p) // 2` calculates the total number of numbers removed, divided by 2.
     - The sum of these two parts is printed as the result.

### Correctness Evaluation

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize Bob's wins. The logic for adjusting counts and determining the number of wins is flawed.

**Issues:**
- The operation to adjust counts to even numbers does not align with the optimal strategy.
- The logic to calculate Bob's wins is incorrect and does not consider the binary representation of numbers properly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
