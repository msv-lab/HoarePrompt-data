### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program to ensure it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. We will focus on the preprocessing and query handling steps, as these are the core parts of the solution.

#### Preprocessing:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `a` and `b` are prepended with 0 to include the starting point.
   - `ad` is calculated as the differences between consecutive points in `a` (distances between points).
   - `bd` is calculated as the differences between consecutive points in `b` (time intervals between points).
   - `v` is calculated as the speeds between each pair of consecutive points (`v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`).

These steps appear correct and ensure that we have the necessary data to compute the time taken to travel between any two points.

#### Query Processing:
1. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the position `ql` is read.
   - `bisect_left` is used to find the index `s` of the first point in `a` that is not less than `ql`.
   - If `ql` exactly matches a point in `a`, the corresponding time `b[s]` is printed.
   - Otherwise, the time to reach `ql` is calculated based on the speed between the previous point `a[s-1]` and the current point `a[s]`. The time is accumulated and printed as an integer.

The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the correct segment for the query. The time calculation is based on the speed between the segment endpoints, and the result is rounded down using `int(m)`. This ensures that the time is correctly computed and rounded down to the nearest integer.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Queries at exact points:** If `ql` matches a point in `a`, the corresponding time `b[s]` is directly returned, which is correct.
- **Queries at the boundary points (0 and n):** The program handles these cases correctly as well, since `bisect_left` will correctly identify the starting or ending points.

### Validation with Function Summary:
The function summary provided states that the function processes multiple test cases and computes the required values based on the provided lists `a` and `b` for each query in `d`. This aligns with the program's behavior, as it correctly preprocesses the data and handles each query as described.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles input parsing, preprocessing, and query processing accurately, and it correctly handles edge cases. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
