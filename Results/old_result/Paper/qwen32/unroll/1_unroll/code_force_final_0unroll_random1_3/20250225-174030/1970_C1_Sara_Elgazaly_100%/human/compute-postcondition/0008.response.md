The only variable in the loop head is `tmp`, and the condition for the loop to execute is that `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst[tmp]` contains at least one element.

Given that `tmp` is initially assigned the value of `z`, we need to adjust the state of `lst` such that `lst[z]` is not an empty list. 

State: **`lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[z]` contains at least one element; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is assigned the value of `z`; `one` is `True`**.
