Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid and Diagonals:**
   - We have an \( n \times n \) grid.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total:
     - \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
     - \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
     - However, the center diagonal is counted twice, so the total is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Objective:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

### Observations

1. **Minimum Cells for \( k \) Diagonals:**
   - If \( k = 1 \), we need only 1 cell.
   - For larger \( k \), we can consider coloring cells in a way that maximizes the number of diagonals covered by each cell.
   - Each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction).

2. **Formula Derivation:**
   - If \( k \) is even, we can cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring \( \frac{k}{2} \) cells.
   - If \( k \) is odd, we need \( \frac{k + 1}{2} \) cells.
   - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) captures both cases.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - \( k \) can be as large as \( 4n - 2 \), but the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) will always be valid since it ensures we cover the required number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

### Code Analysis

Let's examine the given code:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

- **First Condition:**
  - If \( k = 1 \), the code correctly outputs 1.
  
- **Second Condition:**
  - The condition `k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2))` simplifies to `k <= 4n - 4`, which is always true for \( k \leq 4n - 2 \) (since \( k \) is at most \( 4n - 2 \)).
  - If this condition is true, the code outputs \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
  
- **Else Condition:**
  - If the condition is false (which it never will be for valid inputs), the code outputs \( \lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor + 1 \), which is also \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least \( k \) diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
