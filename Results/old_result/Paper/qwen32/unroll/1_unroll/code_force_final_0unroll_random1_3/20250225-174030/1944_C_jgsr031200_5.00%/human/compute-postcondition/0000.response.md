Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that the list `arr` remains unchanged, and a new variable `nums` is created, which is a `Counter` object that holds the count of each unique integer in `arr`.
