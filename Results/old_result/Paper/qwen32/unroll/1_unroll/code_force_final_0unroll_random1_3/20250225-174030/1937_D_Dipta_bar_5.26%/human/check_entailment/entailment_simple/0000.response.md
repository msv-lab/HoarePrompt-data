### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by using two arrays `A` and `B` to keep track of the movements and inversions of the pinball when it encounters '>' and '<' characters, respectively.

1. **Initialization and Forward Pass (A and idx_A):**
    - The program iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
    - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative effect of previous '>' characters and their inversions. This information is stored in `A`.
    - `idx_A` stores the indices of the '>' characters.

2. **Backward Pass (B and idx_B):**
    - The program iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
    - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative effect of previous '<' characters and their inversions. This information is stored in `B`.
    - `idx_B` stores the indices of the '<' characters.

3. **Calculating the Output:**
    - The program uses the values in `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` to determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
    - The logic involves combining the effects of previous '>' and '<' characters, taking into account their inversions, and calculating the total time based on the pinball's movement rules.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the program seems complex and involves detailed calculations to account for the inversions and movements of the pinball.
- The program is designed to handle large inputs efficiently, given the constraints (up to 5 * 10^5 characters in total across all test cases).
- The provided states in the comments suggest that the program is working as intended for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided states and the complexity of the problem, the program appears to correctly implement the solution. The states match the expected behavior of the program and the output for the example test cases is correct.

**Correctness: True**
