t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, an integer q such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, a list c of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9, and a list of q queries where each query is a tuple (l_i, r_i) such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
