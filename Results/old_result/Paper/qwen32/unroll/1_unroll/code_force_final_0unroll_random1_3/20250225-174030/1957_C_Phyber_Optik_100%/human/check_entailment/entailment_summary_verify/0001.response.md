Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior against the problem description and function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the number of different final configurations of rooks on an `n x n` chessboard after `k` moves, considering the mirrored placement rules.
- **Constraints**: The board size `n` can be up to `3 * 10^5`, and the number of initial moves `k` can be up to `n`.
- **Mirroring Rules**: After each player's move at `(r, c)`, the computer places a rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes a `dp` array of size `300007` and precomputes values using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function calculates the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard using the recurrence relation:
     - `dp[1] = 1`
     - `dp[2] = 3`
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for `i >= 3`
   - This recurrence relation is correct for calculating the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to an `invalid` set to track already occupied rows and columns.
   - The program calculates the remaining valid positions as `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The program outputs the value from the `dp` array at the index `n - len(invalid)`.

### Key Points to Challenge:
- **Mirroring Rules**: The program does not explicitly handle the mirroring rules after `k` moves. It only counts the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions without considering the mirrored placements.
- **Final Configurations**: The program assumes that the number of final configurations is simply the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions, which does not account for the mirrored placements correctly.

### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board.
- However, the program does not use this correctly in the context of the problem, as it does not account for the mirrored placements after `k` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for the mirrored placements after `k` moves. It only considers the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions, which is insufficient for solving the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the mirrored placements of rooks after the initial `k` moves.
