To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change throughout its execution.

The given code processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves:
- Two lists `a` and `b` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively.
- An integer `k` which represents a threshold.
- A counter array `cnt_b` of size `max_val + 1` (1,000,001) initialized to zeros.

For each test case, the code performs the following:
1. It counts the occurrences of each element in list `b` using the `cnt_b` array.
2. It initializes a set `b_values` containing unique elements from list `b`.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of valid subarrays.
4. It initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of elements in the current window that are also in `b_values`.
5. It processes the first window of size `m` in list `a` to initialize `curr`.
6. It slides the window across list `a` (from index `m` to `n-1`), updating `curr` and `ans` accordingly.
7. It prints the value of `ans` after processing the current test case.
8. It resets the `cnt_b` array for the next test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and resets the `cnt_b` array after each test case, the state of `cnt_b` at the end of all iterations will be the same as its initial state, which is a list of 1,000,001 zeros.

The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `ans`, and `curr` are local to each test case and do not retain their values after the test case is processed.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a list of 1,000,001 zeros.**
