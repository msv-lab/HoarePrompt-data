You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Requirements:
1. For each test case, we are given:
   - An array `a` of length `n`.
   - A positive integer `m`.
   - A string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.

2. We need to process the commands in `s` in order:
   - Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` modulo `m`.
   - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from `a`.
   - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from `a`.

3. After each command, the length of `a` decreases by 1, and after processing all commands, `a` will be empty.

### Provided Code Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code to see if it meets the problem requirements.

#### Main Loop:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))
```
- This loop iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`. It then calls `func_1` to process this test case and prints the result.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```
- **Step 1:** The function initializes an empty list `b` and two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
- **Step 2:** It iterates over the string `s`:
  - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` (pointed by `l`) to `b` and increments `l`.
  - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` (pointed by `r`) to `b` and decrements `r`.
- **Step 3:** After processing all commands, `b` contains the elements of `a` in the order they were removed.
- **Step 4:** The function then calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and takes the remainder modulo `m`. It appends each intermediate result to `ans`.
- **Step 5:** Finally, it returns `reversed(ans)`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The function `func_1` calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, but the problem requires the product to be calculated in the order the elements were removed from `a`.
- The current implementation does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements of `a` at each step as required by the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain the product of the remaining elements of `a` and update it as elements are removed. The correct approach involves:
- Calculating the initial product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.
- Iterating over the commands in `s` and updating the product by removing the appropriate element (either from the left or the right) and taking the new product modulo `m`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the required product at each step.

Correctness: **False**
