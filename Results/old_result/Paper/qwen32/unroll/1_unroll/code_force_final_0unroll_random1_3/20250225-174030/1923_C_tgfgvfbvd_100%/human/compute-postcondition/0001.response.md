Output State: **The output state consists of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query in every test case, based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and the individual queries `l_i` and `r_i` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `t` decrements as each test case is processed. The lists `p` and `c` are recalculated for each test case and are not preserved across different test cases. The final state of `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.**
