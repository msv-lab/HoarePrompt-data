Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates a specific cost based on the values in `a` and `b` and prints this cost. The function does not modify the input values but outputs a computed value for each test case.**
