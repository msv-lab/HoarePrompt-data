The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated to the integer read from the input, while all other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) remain unchanged and still satisfy their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x; The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
