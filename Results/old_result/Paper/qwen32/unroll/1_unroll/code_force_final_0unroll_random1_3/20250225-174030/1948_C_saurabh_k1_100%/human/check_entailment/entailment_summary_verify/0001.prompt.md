You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length composed of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if there exists a specific pattern of '<' characters that violates a certain condition. If such a pattern is found, it outputs 'No' for that test case; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without altering the input variables beyond the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if a robot can reach the bottom-right corner of a 2-row grid, starting from the top-left corner, by following the arrows placed in each cell. The robot's movement is constrained by the arrows and its ability to move left, right, up, or down within the grid boundaries.

### Key Points
1. **Movement Rules**:
   - The robot first makes a move (left, right, up, or down).
   - Then, it follows the arrow in the cell it lands on.
2. **Grid Layout**:
   - The grid consists of 2 rows and `n` columns.
   - Each cell contains an arrow (`<` or `>`).
3. **Objective**:
   - Determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` from `(1, 1)`.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution attempts to determine if the robot can reach the target cell by iterating through the columns and checking specific conditions.

#### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
```

#### Key Steps in the Code:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of columns `n` is read.
   - The two rows of the grid (`a` and `b`) are read as strings.

2. **Logic for Determining Reachability**:
   - The code iterates through the columns starting from index 1 and increments by 2 (`for i in range(1, n, 2)`).
   - For each column `i`, it checks if there are two consecutive left arrows (`<`) in specific positions:
     - If `i + 1 < n` and both `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are `<`.
     - Or if `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`.
   - If either of these conditions is met, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such conditions, it prints "Yes".

#### Flaws in the Solution:
- The logic of checking only for specific patterns of left arrows (`<`) is flawed. It does not consider all possible paths the robot can take.
- The solution does not account for the robot's ability to move up or down, which can significantly affect the reachability.
- The solution does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step, which is necessary to correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

### Conclusion
The provided solution does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` based on the given problem constraints and rules. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
