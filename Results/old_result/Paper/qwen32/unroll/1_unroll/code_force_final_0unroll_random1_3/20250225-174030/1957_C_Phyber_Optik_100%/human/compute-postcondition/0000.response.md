The code snippet initializes an array or list `dp` such that the element at index 1 is set to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of moves already played (0 ≤ k ≤ n), and `dp[1]` is 1.**
