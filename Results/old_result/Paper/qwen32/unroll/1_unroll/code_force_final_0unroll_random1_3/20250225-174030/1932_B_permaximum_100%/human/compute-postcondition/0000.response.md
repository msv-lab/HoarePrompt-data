The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `test_cases`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6 for each `i`; `results` is an empty list.**
