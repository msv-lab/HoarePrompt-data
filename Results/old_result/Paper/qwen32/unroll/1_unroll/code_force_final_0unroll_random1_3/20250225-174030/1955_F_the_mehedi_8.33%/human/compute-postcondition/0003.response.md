Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. The calculation involves checking if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are equal and odd, and then summing half the counts of each number (rounded down). The output is one line per test case containing the calculated value.**
