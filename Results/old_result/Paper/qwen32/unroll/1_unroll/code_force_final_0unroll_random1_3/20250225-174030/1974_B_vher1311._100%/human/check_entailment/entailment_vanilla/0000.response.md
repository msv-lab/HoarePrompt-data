Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We need to decode a string `b` which was encoded using a specific algorithm.
2. The encoding algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct letters in `b` sorted alphabetically.
3. Each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.
4. To decode, we need to reverse this process:
   - Identify the auxiliary string `r` by finding all distinct characters in `b` and sorting them.
   - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping to get the original string `s`.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the number of test cases `t`, the length of the encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It generates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`.
   - It creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - It then constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `mapping`.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic for generating `r` and the mapping is correct.
- The replacement process using the mapping is also correct.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through them and processing each one independently.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

For the first test case:
- `b = "serofedsoc"`
- `r = "cdefors"`
- Mapping: `c->s`, `d->r`, `e->o`, `f->e`, `o->e`, `r->d`, `s->c`
- Decoding `b` using the mapping results in `s = "codeforces"`.

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
