The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `m` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a value based on the differences between consecutive elements in `m` and compares it to `f`. If the computed value is less than `f`, it outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".
