### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the provided program.

**Problem Analysis:**
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, we need to maximize each individual difference (a_i - a_{i-1}).

**Program Analysis:**
The provided program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements (a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]). This approach is actually correct for maximizing the beauty of the array.

**Explanation:**
When the array is sorted, the maximum beauty can be achieved by taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This is because the beauty is the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and in a sorted array, the sum of these differences is maximized by simply taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

For example:
- Consider the array [2, 1, 3]. Sorting it gives [1, 2, 3]. The beauty is (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2.
- The program calculates 3 - 1 = 2, which is the correct maximum beauty.

In another example:
- Consider the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. Sorting it gives [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty is (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.
- The program calculates 100 - 43 = 57, which is the correct maximum beauty.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and printing the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not maximize the beauty, but it does.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
