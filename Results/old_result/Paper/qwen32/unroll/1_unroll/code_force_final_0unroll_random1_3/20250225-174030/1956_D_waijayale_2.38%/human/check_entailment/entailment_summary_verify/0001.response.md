### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing operations that set subarrays to their MEX (smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray).
- **Constraints:** The number of operations is limited to \(5 \times 10^5\).

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Purpose:** Recursively modifies the array `a` in the range `[l, r]` by setting all elements to the MEX of the subarray and records the operations.
   - **Issue:** The function is supposed to compute the MEX of the subarray and set all elements to this MEX, but it incorrectly sets the elements to `r - l + 1` if they are not already `r - l + 1`. This is incorrect because the MEX is not necessarily `r - l + 1`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Purpose:** Initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the final sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - **Issue:** The function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the array `a` and the list `ops`. This will result in a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):**
   - **Purpose:** Recursively divides the array into subarrays and maximizes the sum of each subarray by setting subarrays to their MEX.
   - **Issue:** The function incorrectly calculates the MEX by setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` if the sum of the subarray is less than the sum of its length squared. This is not the correct approach to finding the MEX. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the operations list `ops` and the base case when `l == r`.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`):**
   - **Purpose:** Reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the result.
   - **Issue:** The function is correctly structured to read input and print the result, but it relies on the correctness of `func_2`, which has issues.

#### Function Summaries:
- The function summary for `func_4` is inaccurate. It states that the function calculates the sum `s` and the maximum `m` of the list `a`, which is incorrect. The function should calculate the maximum possible sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum.

#### Conclusion:
The program contains several critical issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. The logic for calculating the MEX and performing the operations is flawed, and the program does not correctly handle the operations list `ops`.

**Final: False**
