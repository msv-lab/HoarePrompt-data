Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it generates a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters where each character is determined by the count of elements in the reversed list `a` from the current position to the end, minus one, used as an index in the alphabet list. The function outputs this string for each test case.**
