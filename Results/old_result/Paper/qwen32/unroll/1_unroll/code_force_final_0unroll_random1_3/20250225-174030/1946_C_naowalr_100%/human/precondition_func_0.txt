The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which includes multiple sets of input data. Each set starts with two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k < n <= 10^5`, representing the number of vertices and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. This is followed by `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `v` and `u` (1 <= v, u <= n) representing an edge between vertices `v` and `u`. The function processes each set of input data to determine the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.
