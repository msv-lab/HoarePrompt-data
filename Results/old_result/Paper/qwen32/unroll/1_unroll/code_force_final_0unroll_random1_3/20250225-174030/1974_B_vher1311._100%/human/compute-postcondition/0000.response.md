The code snippet processes the `encoded` list of tuples by first extracting all unique characters from the strings within the tuples, sorting them, and then joining them into a single string `r`.

Given the initial state, `encoded` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n`. The code does not modify `encoded` but creates a new string `r` that is the result of sorting and joining the unique characters from all the strings in `encoded`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n over the tuples does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `r` is a string containing the unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order.**
