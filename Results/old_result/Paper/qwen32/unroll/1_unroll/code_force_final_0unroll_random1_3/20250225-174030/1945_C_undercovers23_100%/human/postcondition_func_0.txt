The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of houses `n` and a string `a` of length `n` with '0's and '1's. It determines the smallest index where both '0's and '1's constitute at least 50% of their respective sub-strings. If no such index exists, it returns 0 if the overall percentage of '1's is at least 50%, otherwise it returns `n`.
