You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: For each test case, the variable `year` will hold the cumulative sum calculated by the inner loop, where for each integer `ai` in the list `a`, `year` is incremented by `year % ai` if `year % ai` is not zero, otherwise it is incremented by `ai`. The final value of `year` for each test case is printed. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will not retain their values after the loop completes the iteration for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates a cumulative sum based on the elements of the list and prints the result. Specifically, for each integer in the list, if the current cumulative sum modulo the integer is non-zero, the cumulative sum is incremented by that modulo value; otherwise, it is incremented by the integer itself.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities of the signs. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Input Reading**: The program first reads the number of test cases (t). For each test case, it reads the number of signs (n) and their respective periodicities (a1, a2, ..., an).

2. **Year Calculation**:
   - It initializes the `year` variable to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
     - `year % ai` computes the remainder of the current `year` divided by `ai`. If `year` is a multiple of `ai`, the remainder is 0.
     - `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai` if `year % ai` is 0 (i.e., if `year` is a multiple of `ai`), or `year % ai` otherwise. This effectively calculates the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `year`.
     - The `year` is then updated to this next occurrence.

3. **Output**: After processing all the signs for a test case, the program prints the final `year` which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

The logic correctly implements the requirement that each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The use of `year % ai or ai` ensures that the program correctly calculates the next occurrence of each sign based on the previous year, thus correctly simulating the sequential occurrence of signs.

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
