The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('NO')`. This statement directly prints the string 'NO' to the output, and it does not depend on the values of `n` and `k` as they are not used in the print statement.

Given:
- `n` and `k` are return values from `func_2()`.
- The current value of `n` is 0.

However, these details about `n` and `k` are irrelevant to what gets printed because the `print` statement does not reference these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
