Functionality: **The function takes a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It processes these inputs to produce a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of elements from `a` in a specific order, modulo `m`, as determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order.**
