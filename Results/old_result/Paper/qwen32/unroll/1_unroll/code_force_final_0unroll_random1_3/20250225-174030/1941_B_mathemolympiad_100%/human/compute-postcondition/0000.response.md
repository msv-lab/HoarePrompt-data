Output State: **`numTest` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `numTest` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_j` ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In simple terms, `numTest` now holds the number of test cases read from the input, while all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
