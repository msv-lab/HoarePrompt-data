You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `ntest` remains the integer read from the input. The loop has executed `ntest` times, and for each test case, the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, sorts the list, and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

To maximize this value, we need to arrange the array such that the largest element is at the end and the smallest element is at the beginning. Sorting the array in ascending order and then taking the difference between the last and the first element achieves this.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows the correct logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the array.
   - It reads the array elements.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array.

The program correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Conclusion

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
