Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description. The logic in the loop is not sufficient to cover all possible movements and conditions required to reach the target cell. The program only checks for certain configurations of '<' arrows but does not account for the full range of possible paths and movements the robot can make.

To correctly solve this problem, the program would need to simulate the robot's movements according to the rules provided, taking into account all possible moves and arrow directions.
