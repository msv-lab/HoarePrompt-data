Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of pieces a binary string must be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's). The key observation is that the number of cuts needed is equal to the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string. This is because each such occurrence represents a boundary where the string transitions from '1's to '0's, which cannot be part of a sorted binary string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the provided program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
3. It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
4. It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
5. For each character, it checks if the current character is '1' and the next character is '0'. If so, it increments the `count` by 1.
6. After the loop, it prints `count + 1`, which represents the minimum number of pieces required.

The logic is correct because:
- Each time a '1' is followed by a '0', it indicates a boundary that must be a cut point to separate the '1's and '0's.
- The number of such boundaries plus one gives the minimum number of pieces needed.

Correctness: **True**
