You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer `ans` based on a specific algorithm involving division and summation operations. The final state of the program is a series of printed integers, each corresponding to the result of the calculation for a respective test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
2. \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Mathematical Insight

The condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) can be rewritten as:
\[ \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \in \mathbb{Z} \]

Let's denote \( \gcd(a, b) = d \), then \( a = dx \) and \( b = dy \) where \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). The condition becomes:
\[ \frac{dx + dy}{dy \cdot d} = \frac{x + y}{dy} \in \mathbb{Z} \]
\[ x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{dy} \]

This means that \( y \) must be a divisor of \( x + y \) and \( x \) must be a multiple of \( d \).

### Analysis of the Program

The provided program has a different approach and logic. Let's break it down:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   count = 2
   ans = n
   ```
   - `count` starts at 2, and `ans` is initialized to `n`, which means it counts pairs where \( b = 1 \).

2. **Loop**:
   ```python
   while count <= m:
       countmins = int(count - 1)
       g = int(n / count)
       if g < countmins:
           break
       g -= countmins
       ans += int(g / count) + 1
       count += 1
   ```
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `count` (which seems to represent `b`).
   - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - `g` is decremented by `countmins`.
   - `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(int(ans))
   ```

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
- **Initialization**: The initial value of `ans` being set to `n` is incorrect as it does not account for all valid pairs where \( b = 1 \) and \( a + 1 \) is a multiple of \( 1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) \) (which is always true).
- **Loop Condition**: The loop condition and the logic inside the loop do not correctly iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` to check the given condition.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic inside the loop and the initialization of `ans` are incorrect, and the program does not properly count all valid pairs (a, b).
