The function reads multiple sets of input data from standard input, where each set consists of two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of vertices and the number of edges to be removed, respectively, followed by `n-1` lines of edges between vertices. For each set, the function determines the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.
