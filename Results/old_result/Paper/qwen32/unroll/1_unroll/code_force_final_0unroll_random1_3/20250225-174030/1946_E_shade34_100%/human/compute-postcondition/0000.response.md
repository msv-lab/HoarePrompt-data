The code snippet calls `func_1` with `b` and `1000000007` as arguments and assigns the returned values to `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can state that `c` and `d` will hold the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.
