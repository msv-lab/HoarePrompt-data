### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to determine the minimum number of groups required to divide the integers such that no two numbers in the same group share any bit values from the 1st to the 31st bit in their binary representation.

The provided function `func_1` tries to achieve this by using a dictionary to keep track of the numbers and their bitwise complements. However, the logic in the function is flawed. Specifically, the function is not correctly identifying the minimum number of groups required.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the function is incorrect:

1. **Bitwise Complement and Counting**: The function uses the bitwise complement of the numbers (with respect to 31 bits) to try to match numbers. However, it does not correctly handle the logic of ensuring that no two numbers in the same group share any bit positions. The bitwise complement alone does not guarantee that no two numbers in a group share any bits.

2. **Incorrect Group Formation**: The function increments the result `res` every time it encounters a number that hasn't been seen before in a certain form (either directly or via its complement). This does not guarantee that the numbers are correctly grouped according to the problem's constraints.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Matches**: The function attempts to decrement the count of numbers and remove them from the dictionary when a match is found. However, this logic doesn't correctly ensure that the numbers are grouped such that no two numbers in a group share any bits.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach to solve this problem would involve using a graph coloring algorithm where each number is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if they share any bit in their binary representation from the 1st to the 31st bit. The chromatic number of this graph (the minimum number of colors needed to color the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color) would be the answer.

However, a more efficient approach involves using a greedy algorithm with a bitset to track the used bit positions for each group.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues described, the provided function does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
