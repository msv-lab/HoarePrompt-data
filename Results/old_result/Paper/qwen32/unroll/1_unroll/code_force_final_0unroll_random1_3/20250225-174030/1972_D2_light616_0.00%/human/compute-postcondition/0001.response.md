The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. The initial states of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `cnt` and the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `x` is 1; `cnt` is 0.**
