grid is a list of lists of characters, where each inner list has the same length, and each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The outer list represents the rows of the grid, and the inner lists represent the columns. The number of rows (t) is between 1 and 10^4, and the number of columns (m) is between 1 and 500. The total number of cells across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
