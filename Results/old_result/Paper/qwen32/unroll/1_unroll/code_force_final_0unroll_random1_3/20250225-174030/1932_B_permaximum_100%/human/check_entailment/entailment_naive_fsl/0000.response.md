Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of periodicities (`a`) and calculates the year in which each sign will occur sequentially. The logic for determining the next occurrence of each sign is accurate. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0, which represents the starting year.
2. **Iteration through signs**: For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be in `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be in the next multiple of `ai`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
3. **Updating current_year**: After determining the next occurrence of the sign, it updates `current_year` to `next_year`.
4. **Storing results**: After processing all signs in a test case, it appends the final `current_year` (which represents the year of the n-th sign occurrence) to the results list.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The code handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, such as when all periodicities are 1, or when the periodicities are larger numbers. The logic ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
