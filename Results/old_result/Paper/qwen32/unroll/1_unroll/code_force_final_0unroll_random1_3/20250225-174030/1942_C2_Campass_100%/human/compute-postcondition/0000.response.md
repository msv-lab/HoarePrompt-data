The given code snippet defines a lambda function `R` which reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function does not directly affect the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. It merely prepares for future input processing.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. `R` is a lambda function that reads and maps a line of input to integers.**
