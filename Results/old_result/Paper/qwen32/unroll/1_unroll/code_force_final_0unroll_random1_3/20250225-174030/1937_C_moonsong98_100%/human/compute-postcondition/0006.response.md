To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `n`, and the range parameters `0` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if the range `(0, n)` is non-empty. This means `n` must be greater than `0`. The condition `n` is not equal to `2` does not affect the ability of the loop to execute, so we do not need to change that. Instead, we just need to ensure `n` is greater than `0`.

The variable `max_index` is mentioned in the initial state but is not part of the loop head, so we do not need to adjust it for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than `0`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_index` is 0**
