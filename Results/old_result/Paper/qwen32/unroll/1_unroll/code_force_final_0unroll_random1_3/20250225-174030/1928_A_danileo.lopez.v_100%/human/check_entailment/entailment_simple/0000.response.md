### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can cut a given rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle. The key observation is that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, it can be split into two equal parts along that dimension. If the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions, the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it's "No".

Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Even Dimension Check**: For each test case, the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If \(a\) is even, it splits the rectangle into two parts of size \(a/2 \times b\). If \(a/2 \neq b\), it means the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \(b \times a/2\), hence the answer is "Yes".
   - If \(b\) is even, it splits the rectangle into two parts of size \(a \times b/2\). If \(a \neq b/2\), it means the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \(a \times b/2\), hence the answer is "Yes".
3. **Odd Dimension Handling**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the rectangle cannot be split into two equal parts along any dimension, so the answer is "No".

The provided code correctly implements this logic. It checks if either dimension is even and then checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle with different dimensions. If either dimension is even and the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the logic is correctly implemented and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
