Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a list of strings. Each string in the list consists of lowercase Latin letters, with each string's length ranging from 1 to 200,000 characters. The length of the list `s` ranges from 1 to 10,000, and the total sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 200,000 characters. The function returns a string that contains all unique characters from the list `s` in reverse order of their first appearance in the list.**
