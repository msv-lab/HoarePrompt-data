You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9.

    #State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query in every test case, based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and the individual queries `l_i` and `r_i` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `t` decrements as each test case is processed. The lists `p` and `c` are recalculated for each test case and are not preserved across different test cases. The final state of `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the sum of the elements in a specified range of the list, minus the number of elements in that range, is greater than or equal to the count of the number 1s in that range. It outputs 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Good Array Definition**:
   - An array `a` of length `m` is considered "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of length `m` such that:
     1. The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     2. `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i` from 1 to `m`.
     3. `b_i > 0` for every index `i` from 1 to `m`.

2. **Task**:
   - Given an array `c` of length `n` and `q` queries, determine if each subarray `c[l_i, c[l_i+1], ..., c[r_i]]` is "good".

3. **Approach**:
   - For each query, check if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that meets the conditions above.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
The provided program attempts to determine if a subarray is "good" by calculating the sum of the subarray and the number of `1`s in the subarray. It then checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of `1`s in the subarray.

Here's the logic breakdown:
- **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
  - `p`: Prefix sum array where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `c`.
  - `c`: Prefix count array where `c[i]` is the count of `1`s in the first `i` elements of `c`.

- **Query Processing**:
  - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, c[l_i+1], ..., c[r_i]]` using the prefix sum array `p`.
  - It also calculates the number of `1`s in the subarray using the prefix count array `c`.
  - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is checked to determine if the subarray is "good".

### Checking for Correctness:
Let's consider some edge cases and scenarios to ensure the program works correctly:

1. **Subarray with All Elements Equal to 1**:
   - Example: `c = [1, 1, 1]`
   - Subarray: `c[1, 3]`
   - Sum: `3`
   - Number of `1`s: `3`
   - Condition: `3 - 3 >= 3` → `0 >= 3` → `False`
   - Expected: `NO` (Correct)

2. **Subarray with All Elements Greater than 1**:
   - Example: `c = [2, 2, 2]`
   - Subarray: `c[1, 3]`
   - Sum: `6`
   - Number of `1`s: `0`
   - Condition: `3 > 1 and 6 - 3 >= 0` → `True`
   - Expected: `YES` (Correct)

3. **Subarray with Mixed Elements**:
   - Example: `c = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Subarray: `c[1, 3]`
   - Sum: `6`
   - Number of `1`s: `1`
   - Condition: `3 > 1 and 6 - 3 >= 1` → `True`
   - Expected: `YES` (Correct)

4. **Subarray with Single Element**:
   - Example: `c = [2]`
   - Subarray: `c[1, 1]`
   - Sum: `2`
   - Number of `1`s: `0`
   - Condition: `1 > 1 and 2 - 1 >= 0` → `False`
   - Expected: `NO` (Correct)

5. **Subarray with Single Element Equal to 1**:
   - Example: `c = [1]`
   - Subarray: `c[1, 1]`
   - Sum: `1`
   - Number of `1`s: `1`
   - Condition: `1 > 1 and 1 - 1 >= 1` → `False`
   - Expected: `NO` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly handle the cases where the subarray is "good" or not based on the given conditions. It properly calculates the prefix sums and counts, and checks the conditions for each query.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the prefix sums and counts, and checks the conditions for each query to determine if the subarray is "good". It handles various edge cases, including subarrays with all elements equal to 1, all elements greater than 1, mixed elements, and single-element subarrays.
