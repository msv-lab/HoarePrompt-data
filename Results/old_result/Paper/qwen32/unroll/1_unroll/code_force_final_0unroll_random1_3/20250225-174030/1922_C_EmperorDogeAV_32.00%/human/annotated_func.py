#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i) representing the queries. n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of cities, and m is an integer (1 <= m <= 10^5) representing the number of queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is determined uniquely.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: cities is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i) representing the queries; prog_cities is [1, 2, 1].
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns [1, 2, 1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates in ascending order and calculates a list where each element represents the closest city or the distance to the closest city for each city in the input list, excluding the first and last cities. The function returns this list of closest city indicators or distances.
