Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the robot's movement as described in the problem statement. The provided counterexample demonstrates that the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate all possible movements of the robot.

Let's break down the counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><>>
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (2, 1) and then follow the arrow to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), it can move to (1, 2) and then follow the arrow to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it can move to (2, 3) and then follow the arrow to (2, 4).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly returns "NO" for this input because it only checks specific patterns of arrows and does not simulate the robot's movement comprehensively. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if there are specific configurations of arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell (2, n), but it does not account for all possible valid paths the robot can take.

The annotations in the annotated code confirm that the function `func_1` only checks for specific conditions and does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
