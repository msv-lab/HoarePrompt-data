In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`, as it determines how many times the loop will execute. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need any adjustment. 

To ensure that the loop executes, `func_10()` must return a value that is greater than or equal to 1. If `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative number, the loop will not execute.

Given that we can only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, and `func_10()` is a function call, we need to ensure that the function returns a value that allows the loop to execute. Since we cannot directly modify the function `func_10()`, we assume that the state before the loop must ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
