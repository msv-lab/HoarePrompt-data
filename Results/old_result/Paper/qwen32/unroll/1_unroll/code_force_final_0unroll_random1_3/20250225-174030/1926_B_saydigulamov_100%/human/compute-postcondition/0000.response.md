The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. This does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `grid`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `grid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of lists where each element is either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all '1's, and the size of this shape is greater than 1; `a` is an input integer.**
