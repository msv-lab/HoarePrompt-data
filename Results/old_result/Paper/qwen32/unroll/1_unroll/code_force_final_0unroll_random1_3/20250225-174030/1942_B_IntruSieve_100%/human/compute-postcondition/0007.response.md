To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n.
   - `mex` is an empty list.
   - `minn` is 0.
   - `used` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element in `arr` (from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`):
     - If the element `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
       - Append `minn` to the `mex` list.
       - Mark `minn` as used by adding it to the `used` dictionary.
       - Increment `minn` until it finds the next smallest number that hasn't been used yet.
     - If the element `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
       - Compute `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - Append this computed value to the `mex` list.
       - Mark this computed value as used by adding it to the `used` dictionary.

3. **Post-Loop State**:
   - After all iterations, `mex` will contain `n` elements, each computed based on the conditions described.
   - `minn` will be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the `used` dictionary.
   - `used` will be a dictionary containing all the unique values that have been added to `mex`.

**Output State**: **`t` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `arr` remains unchanged; `mex` is a list of `n` integers computed as described; `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`; `used` is a dictionary of all unique values in `mex`.**

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n; `mex` is a list of `n` integers computed based on the loop conditions; `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`; `used` is a dictionary of all unique values in `mex`.**
