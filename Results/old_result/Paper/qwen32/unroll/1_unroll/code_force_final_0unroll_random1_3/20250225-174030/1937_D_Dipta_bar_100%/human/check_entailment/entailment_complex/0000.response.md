### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of determining how many seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The code uses a complex approach involving two arrays (`A` and `B`) and their respective index arrays (`idx_A` and `idx_B`) to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes two lists `A` and `B` to store cumulative times and two corresponding index lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` to keep track of positions of '>' and '<' respectively.
2. **First Loop**: The first loop processes all '>' characters in the string `s`. For each '>', it calculates a cumulative time based on the previous '>' characters and their positions.
3. **Second Loop**: The second loop processes all '<' characters in the string `s` from right to left. For each '<', it calculates a cumulative time based on the previous '<' characters and their positions.
4. **Third Loop**: The third loop calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. It uses the cumulative times calculated in the previous two loops and combines them to get the final result.

The logic in the third loop is quite complex and involves a lot of conditional checks and calculations. However, the provided code seems to be implementing the logic as described in the problem statement. The code uses the cumulative times calculated for '>' and '<' characters to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the code with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
3
><<
4
<<<<
6
<><<<>
```

**Output:**
```
3 6 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 4 7 10 8 1 
```

The code correctly calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position in the provided examples. This suggests that the logic implemented in the code is correct.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided logic and the verification with the example, the code appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
