#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer that is input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`. The function does not take any parameters and returns the result of mapping `int` over the input split into parts, which implies that it is expected to be used in a context where `input()` provides a space-separated string of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers, which are the results of converting each part of the space-separated string provided by `input()` into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a space-separated string of integers from the input, converts each integer from the string into an integer type, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no input parameters and returns a list of integers by splitting an input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No specific variables are present in the function signature of `func_4`. The function does not take any parameters and thus there are no preconditions related to input variables.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers derived from the input string, where the input string is split by spaces and each split element is converted to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a string of space-separated values from the input, converts each value to an integer, sorts these integers, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_5`.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each element of the list produced by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes no input parameters, reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each element of this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_6` does not have any parameters, indicating it does not rely on any external input values for its execution.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of characters from the input string provided by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters in its signature, so no precondition can be derived from the variables in the function signature.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a word from the input, split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into words, converts each word to a string, sorts these strings alphabetically, and returns the sorted list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]

    #State: arr is [2, 3, 4]; ans is [2, 6, 24]; tem is 24.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans which is [2, 6, 24]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements from the input list up to that point.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []

    #State: `arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` in reverse order; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` in reverse order.
