### Reasoning:
The original assessment states that the code is incorrect because the `BalanceInfo` class is not defined in the provided code. However, upon closer inspection of the annotated version of the code, we can see that the `BalanceInfo` class is indeed defined at the beginning of the annotated code snippet. The class definition is as follows:

```python
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
```

This class is used in the `func_2` function to store the balance, position, and character for each parenthesis in the input string. Therefore, the code is not missing the `BalanceInfo` class definition.

The annotated version also provides a detailed explanation of the state of the program at key points, including the sorting criteria and the final output. The annotations confirm that the code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct because it includes the necessary `BalanceInfo` class definition and correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation.
