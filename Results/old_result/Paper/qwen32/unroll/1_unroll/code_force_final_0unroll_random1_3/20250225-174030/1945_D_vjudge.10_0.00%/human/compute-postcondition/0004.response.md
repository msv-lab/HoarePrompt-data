The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the elements of the list `custos`. To ensure the loop can execute, the list `custos` must have at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `x`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `custos` must contain at least one integer.

State: **`custos` is a list of `x` integers, where `x` must be at least 1, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b` remain unchanged**
