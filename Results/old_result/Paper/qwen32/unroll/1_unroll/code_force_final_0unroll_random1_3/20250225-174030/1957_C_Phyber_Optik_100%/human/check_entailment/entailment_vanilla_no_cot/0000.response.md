Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described.

1. **Initialization of `dp` Array**: The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007, which is fine, but the function `func_1` is called before the input reading starts, which means it's trying to use `dp` before it's properly set up. This is not a critical issue in terms of logic but can lead to confusion.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `invalid` Set**: The `invalid` set is only storing the rows and columns where rooks have been placed, but it should differentiate between rows and columns, especially when considering the mirrored moves by the computer. The current implementation incorrectly treats row and column indices as interchangeable.

3. **Incorrect Use of `dp` Array**: The `dp` array is supposed to store the number of ways to place rooks in a grid of size `i` with no rooks placed yet, but the program incorrectly uses it by subtracting the length of `invalid` from `n` and then using that value to index `dp`. This does not correctly account for the mirrored moves and the constraints of the problem.

4. **Logic for Counting Configurations**: The logic in the program does not correctly account for the fact that if a rook is placed at `(r, c)`, the computer places a rook at `(c, r)`, and if `r == c`, the computer skips its turn. The program also does not correctly handle the case where there are no valid moves remaining.

To fix the program, you would need to properly keep track of which rows and columns are invalid, account for the mirrored moves, and correctly compute the number of configurations based on the remaining valid positions on the board. The current implementation does not do this correctly.
