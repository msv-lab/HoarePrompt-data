You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list containing multiple test cases, where each test case is represented as a list. Each test case list starts with two integers n and k, followed by n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. Here, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is the number of test cases, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 is the number of cows, 1 ≤ k ≤ n is the index of the cow owned by the user, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 are the distinct Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        
        if c == 2:
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2.
    if (k == 14) :
        print(ind)
        #This is printed: ind (where ind is a list containing indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than x)
    #State: `a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.
    if (ind == []) :
        return n - 1
        #The program returns n - 1.
    #State: `a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.
    if (len(ind) == 1) :
        if (ind[0] == 0) :
            return k - 1
            #The program returns k - 1. Since k is either 14 or remains unchanged, and we know that if k is 14 it stays 14, the return value will be either 13 or k - 1 depending on the original value of k (if it was not 14).
        #State: `a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x` with the current length of `ind` being 1, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list. The first element of `ind` is not 0. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.
        if (ind[0] > k) :
            return ind[0] - 1
            #The program returns the first element of `ind` minus 1, where the first element of `ind` is greater than 14
        #State: `a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x` with the current length of `ind` being 1, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list. The first element of `ind` is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
        #The program returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is an index greater than 0 and less than or equal to `k`.
    #State: `a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list. The length of `ind` is not equal to 1. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.
    if (ind[0] == 0) :
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
        #The program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
    #State: `a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1. `ind[0]` is not equal to 0. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.
    if (k > ind[1]) :
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
        #The program returns the larger value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
    #State: `a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1. `ind[0]` is not equal to 0. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged. `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list containing multiple test cases. Each test case is a list starting with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function returns different values based on the conditions specified:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns n - 1.

Case_2: The program returns k - 1. Since k is either 14 or remains unchanged, and we know that if k is 14 it stays 14, the return value will be either 13 or k - 1 depending on the original value of k (if it was not 14).

Case_3: The program returns the first element of `ind` minus 1, where the first element of `ind` is greater than 14

Case_4: The program returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is an index greater than 0 and less than or equal to `k`.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.

Case_6: The program returns the larger value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.
