### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

#### 1. Initialization:
- The program correctly initializes the necessary variables, including `n` and `m` for the dimensions of the field, `players` for the positions of players, `goals` for the positions of goals, `mouvements` for the direction vectors, `middle` for the middle of the field, and `quidditch` for the position and carrier of the Quaffle.
- It initializes the score counters `pointsr` and `pointsb` to 0.

#### 2. Reading the Field:
- The program reads the field line by line, parsing each cell and updating the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
- The Bludger is also correctly identified and stored in the `players` dictionary.

#### 3. Processing Moves:
- The program processes each move in the input:
  - **Movement (U, D, L, R):** The program updates the position of the entity performing the move using the `func_1` function.
  - **Catch (C):** The program assigns the Quaffle to the player who catches it.
  - **Throw (T):** The program releases the Quaffle from the player who throws it. It then checks if the Quaffle is at a goal and updates the score accordingly. If the Quaffle is in the correct goal, the other team scores. The Quaffle is then moved to the middle of the field.
  - **Elimination:** If a player moves to the same position as the Bludger, the player is eliminated. If the player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, the Quaffle remains at the position of elimination.

#### 4. Output:
- The program prints the events (goals and eliminations) in the correct order.
- It prints the final score at the end of the game.

#### 5. Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is intended to update the position of an entity based on a movement direction. However, there is a mistake in the comments stating that the function incorrectly returns `(a + b, a + b)`. The actual implementation is correct and returns `(x + dx, y + dy)`, where `(x, y)` is the current position and `(dx, dy)` is the direction vector.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the problem description, except for the incorrect comment about the `func_1` function. The function itself is correctly implemented.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
