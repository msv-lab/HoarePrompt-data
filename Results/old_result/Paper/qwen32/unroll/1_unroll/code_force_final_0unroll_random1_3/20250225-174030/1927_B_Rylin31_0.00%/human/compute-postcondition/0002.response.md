Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. The function returns a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters for each test case, ensuring that the string meets certain conditions based on the list `a`.**
