Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description. The logic in the program checks for a specific pattern of '<' characters in the grid, but it does not simulate the robot's movement as described in the problem. The robot can move in four directions and follow the arrows, but the program only checks for a specific pattern without simulating the robot's path.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the robot's movement starting from (1, 1) and determine if it can reach (2, n). The robot should be able to move left, right, down, or up, following the arrows in the grid, and the program should check if there is a valid path to the target cell.

Since the given program does not simulate the robot's movement correctly, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
