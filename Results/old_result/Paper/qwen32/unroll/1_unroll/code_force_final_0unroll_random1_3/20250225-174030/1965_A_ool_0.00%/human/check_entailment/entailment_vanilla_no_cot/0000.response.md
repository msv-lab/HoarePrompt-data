Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. The logic implemented in `func_1` is incorrect for determining the winner of the Nim game variant described.

The game described is a variant of Nim where the winning strategy depends on the binary XOR (Nim-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player will lose if the opponent plays optimally. If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the player can always force a win with optimal play.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function using the Nim-sum logic:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    nim_sum = 0
    for a in arr:
        nim_sum ^= a
    return 'Alice' if nim_sum != 0 else 'Bob'
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine the winner for each test case.
