Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The code is complex and seems to have multiple issues, including incorrect handling of indices and logic for determining the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. 

The approach needs to correctly simulate the process of the pinball moving according to the characters in the string, inverting them as it moves, and keeping track of the time taken for each query. The current implementation does not accurately reflect this process and appears to use incorrect formulas and logic for calculating the time.

To correctly solve the problem, a more straightforward approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each query while keeping track of the time taken and inverting the characters as specified. This can be optimized using data structures like stacks or queues to efficiently manage the indices and movements.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
