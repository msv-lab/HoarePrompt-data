The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the states of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is the loop variable that will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`A` is [0, 1, 3, 12]; `idx_A` is [0, 1, 2, 5]; `B` is []; `idx_B` is []; `n` must be greater than 0; `j` is 0**
