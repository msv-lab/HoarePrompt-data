### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not directly address the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, it focuses on modular arithmetic functions which are not directly related to the problem's core logic. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires counting permutations of length `n` such that the given indices are prefix and suffix maximums. This involves combinatorial counting based on the constraints provided.

2. **Functions Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. This is correct for its intended purpose but does not contribute to solving the permutation problem.
   - **`func_2(a, b)`**: Uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` and then multiplies it by `a`, taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is also correct for its intended purpose but again, does not directly solve the permutation problem.

3. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The program first checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If these conditions are not met, it outputs 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial techniques involving factorials and modular arithmetic.
   - The use of `func_2` for combinatorial calculations is appropriate for handling large numbers and ensuring results are modulo `10^9 + 7`.

4. **Combinatorial Counting**:
   - The code uses factorials to compute binomial coefficients, which are necessary for counting permutations with specific constraints.
   - The logic for iterating through the prefix and suffix maximums and calculating the number of valid permutations is implemented correctly based on combinatorial principles.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - The code correctly handles the example cases provided in the problem description, producing the expected outputs.

Given the analysis above, the program does include the necessary combinatorial logic to count permutations with the given prefix and suffix maximums, and it correctly uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers. The original assessment incorrectly concludes that the program is not correct for solving the problem.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate. The provided program is correct for solving the given problem.

**Final: True**
