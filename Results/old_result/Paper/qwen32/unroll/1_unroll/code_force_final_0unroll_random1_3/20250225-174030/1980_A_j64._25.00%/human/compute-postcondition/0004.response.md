Output State: **The program returns the `results` list, which contains `t` elements. Each element in the `results` list is the number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the corresponding test case string `a`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list where each entry indicates how many more characters are needed in a test case string to make sure that each letter from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times.
