Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. The program only checks the first and last elements of the array for certain conditions, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the operations affect three consecutive elements at a time and that the parity (odd or even nature) of the elements plays a crucial role. Specifically, the sum of the elements in the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero. Additionally, the parity of the elements must follow a specific pattern that allows the operations to be applied in such a way that all elements can be reduced to zero.

Here's a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4.
2. Ensure that the array can be reduced to zero by checking the parities and the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_sum = sum(a)
        
        if total_sum % 4 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if we can reduce the array to zero
        # We need to ensure that we can balance the elements
        # by checking the differences and parities.
        prefix_sum = [0] * n
        prefix_sum[0] = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + a[i]
        
        # Check if we can balance the array using the operations
        possible = True
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[i - 1]) % 2 != 0:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This program correctly checks the sum of the array and the parities of the differences between consecutive elements to determine if it is possible to make all elements zero.
