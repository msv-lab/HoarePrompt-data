Correctness: **False**

The provided program includes several utility functions for input and processing, but it does not contain the main logic to solve the problem described. The task is to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation. The given functions do not address this logic, and there is no main function or code to process the input test cases and produce the required output.

To solve the problem, you would need to implement a strategy that involves sorting the array and using permutations to maximize the frequency of any single element. The current code does not provide this functionality.
