The code appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. The initial state of `ans` is a list containing the first `lk - 1` powers of 2, followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`. After the code execution, the list `ans` will have an additional element, which is `2 * k + 1`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the first `lk - 1` powers of 2, followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, then `k + 1`, and finally `2 * k + 1`.**
