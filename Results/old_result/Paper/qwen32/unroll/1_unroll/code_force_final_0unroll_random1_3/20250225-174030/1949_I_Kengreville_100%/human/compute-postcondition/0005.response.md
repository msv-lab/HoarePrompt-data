The code snippet `coef = [None] * n` initializes the list `coef` with `n` `None` values. This operation does not affect the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`).

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` None values, `y` is a list of `n` None values, `r` is a list of `n` None values, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, and `coef` is a list of `n` None values.**
