To determine the output state after all the iterations of the given loop, we need to understand what the loop does:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It sums up every second element starting from the first element (i.e., it sums the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2).
5. It prints the sum.

Given this, the output state will be a series of sums, one for each test case, printed on separate lines.

Since the problem asks for the output state in a specific format, and the loop itself handles the printing, the output state will simply be the printed sums for each test case.

Here's the format for the output state:

Output State: **the printed sums for each test case, one per line.**

Since we don't have specific input values to compute the exact sums, we describe the output state in terms of the process:

Output State: **For each test case, the sum of every second element from the sorted list of 2n integers.**
