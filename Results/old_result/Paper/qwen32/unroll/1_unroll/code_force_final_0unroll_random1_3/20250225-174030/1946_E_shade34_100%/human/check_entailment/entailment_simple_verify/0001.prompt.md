You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the problem and the provided functions in detail. The problem requires us to find the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximum indices.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Maximums**: These are indices in the permutation where the element at that index is greater than all elements before it.
2. **Suffix Maximums**: These are indices in the permutation where the element at that index is greater than all elements after it.
3. **Output**: We need to output the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Functions Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and also finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - The return value `(c, d)` corresponds to the coefficients `x` and `y`.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` and then multiplies it by `a`, taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - The modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` is a number `x` such that `b * x ≡ 1 (mod 10^9 + 7)`.

### Correctness of the Program

The provided code does not directly solve the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, it includes functions that are typically used for modular arithmetic operations, such as computing the modular multiplicative inverse.

To solve the problem correctly, we would need to:
- Use combinatorial techniques to count the number of valid permutations.
- Ensure that the prefix and suffix maximum conditions are satisfied.
- Use the modular arithmetic functions to handle large numbers and ensure results are modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The given code does not include any logic to handle the prefix and suffix maximum conditions or to count permutations. Therefore, the provided code is not correct for solving the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
