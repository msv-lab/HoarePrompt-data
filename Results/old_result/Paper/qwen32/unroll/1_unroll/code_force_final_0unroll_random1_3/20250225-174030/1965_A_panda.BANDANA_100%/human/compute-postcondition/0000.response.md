The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the provided code snippet, the value of `t` is set to the integer input by the user. The other parts of the initial state, such as the number of piles `n` and the number of stones in each pile `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases.**
