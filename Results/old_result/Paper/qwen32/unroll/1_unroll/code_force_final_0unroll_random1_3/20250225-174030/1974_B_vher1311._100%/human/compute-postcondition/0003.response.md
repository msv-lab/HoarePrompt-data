Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n`, where `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a single string where each character from all strings in `encoded` has been replaced by its mirrored counterpart from the `mapping` dictionary.**
