### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order. When the array is sorted, the difference between consecutive elements will be non-negative, and the overall beauty will be maximized by the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array.

The provided program reads multiple test cases, sorts each array, and then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array. This difference is printed as the maximum beauty for each test case.

Let's analyze the example given in the problem statement:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Beauty: \((2-1) + (3-2) = 2\)
   - Program Output: `3 - 1 = 2` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: \((69-69) + (69-69) = 0\)
   - Program Output: `69 - 69 = 0` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Beauty: \((54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)
   - Program Output: `100 - 43 = 57` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Beauty: \((3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
   - Program Output: `4 - 3 = 1` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Beauty: \((2-1) = 1\)
   - Program Output: `2 - 1 = 1` (Correct)

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty for each test case by sorting the array and computing the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
