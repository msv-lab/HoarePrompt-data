Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, and a grid represented by a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing only the characters 'W' and 'B'. The function returns a value for each test case based on the grid provided.**
