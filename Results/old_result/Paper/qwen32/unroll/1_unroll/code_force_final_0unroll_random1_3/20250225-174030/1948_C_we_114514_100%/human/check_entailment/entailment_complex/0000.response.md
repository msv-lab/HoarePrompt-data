### Reasoning:
Let's analyze whether the provided program correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires determining if a robot can move from cell (1, 1) to cell (2, n) on a 2-row grid based on the direction of arrows in each cell. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and then must move according to the arrow in its current cell.

The provided code consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: This function checks specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. It iterates through the first half of the grid, checking for certain patterns in the arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching the target. If such patterns are found, it returns "No"; otherwise, it returns "Yes".
- `func_2`: This function handles input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and then prints the results.

However, the logic in `func_1` is not sufficient to correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell. The function checks for specific patterns in the first half of the grid but does not simulate the robot's movement through the entire grid. This means it may incorrectly return "Yes" or "No" based on incomplete analysis.

For example, consider the third test case in the problem statement:
```
4
>>><
>><<
```
The robot can indeed reach the target cell (2, 4) by moving as follows: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4). However, `func_1` might not correctly identify this path and could return "No" based on its limited checks.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the entire grid and may return incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
