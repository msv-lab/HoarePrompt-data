Output State: **The program returns the tuple (x + dx, y + dy), where x and y are both equal to 'a' (the number of rows in the field), and dx and dy are both equal to 'b' (the number of columns in the field). Therefore, the returned tuple is (a + b, a + b).**

Natural Language: The program returns a tuple where each element is the sum of the number of rows and the number of columns in the field.
