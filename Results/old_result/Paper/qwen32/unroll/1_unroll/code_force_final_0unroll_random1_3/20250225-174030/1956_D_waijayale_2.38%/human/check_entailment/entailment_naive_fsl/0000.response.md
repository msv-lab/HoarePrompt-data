Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code is incorrect due to several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description's requirements.

1. The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`, but `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`. Instead, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is defined separately, but it does not have access to the variable `a` and `ops` from `func_2`. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies the list `a` and the list `ops` directly, but these modifications are not reflected in `func_2` because `a` and `ops` are not passed as parameters to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

3. The function `func_1` is supposed to perform operations to maximize the sum of the array, but it incorrectly sets `a[l]` to 0 when `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`. This is incorrect because the goal is to maximize the sum of the array, and setting elements to 0 will not help in achieving that.

4. The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the MEX of the subarray and set the subarray to this MEX value, but it does not correctly compute the MEX. Instead, it sets the subarray to `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. This is not the correct approach to maximize the sum of the array.

5. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` incorrectly checks the sum of the subarray and compares it to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. This comparison is not relevant to the problem, and the logic based on this comparison is incorrect.

6. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly handle the case where the maximum value in the subarray is at the boundary (`pos == l` or `pos == r`). It should handle these cases properly to ensure that the entire array is processed correctly.

7. The function `func_3` is the main function that reads input and prints the result, but it relies on the incorrect logic in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be rewritten to correctly compute the MEX of subarrays and set the subarrays to this MEX value to maximize the sum of the array. The logic for handling subarrays and computing the MEX needs to be corrected, and the functions need to properly pass and modify the array and operations list.
