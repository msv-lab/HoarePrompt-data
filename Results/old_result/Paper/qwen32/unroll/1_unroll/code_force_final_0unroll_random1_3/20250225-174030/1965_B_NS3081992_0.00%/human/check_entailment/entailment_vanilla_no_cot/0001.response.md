Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires constructing a sequence of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence with a sum equal to `k`.
2. For all values `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there exists a subsequence with a sum equal to `v`.

### Program Analysis

The program defines several functions, but the core logic for solving the problem is found in `func_14()`. Let's break down how this function works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_7()` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - `b = bin(n)[2:]` converts `n` to its binary representation (without the '0b' prefix).
   - `l = len(b)` stores the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Handling Special Case (k == 1):**
   - If `k == 1`, the program constructs a sequence starting with `2` and `3`, and then adds powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` except `1` can be formed.

4. **General Case (k != 1):**
   - `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts `k` to its binary representation.
   - `lk = len(bk)` stores the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - The program constructs a sequence starting with powers of `2` up to `lk-1`.
   - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - The sequence also includes `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`.
   - Finally, it adds powers of `2` from `lk` to `l`.

5. **Output:**
   - The constructed sequence is converted to a string and returned.

### Evaluation

Let's check if this logic meets the problem requirements:
- For `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` ensures all sums from `2` to `n` can be formed, but not `1`.
- For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid the sum `k` by adding `k - 1 - sum(ans)` and ensuring that all other sums can be formed with the included powers of `2` and additional terms.

### Conclusion

The program's logic appears to correctly construct the required sequence for each test case. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
