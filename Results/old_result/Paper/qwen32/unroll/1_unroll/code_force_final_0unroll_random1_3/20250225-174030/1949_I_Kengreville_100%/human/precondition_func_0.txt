n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x and y are lists of integers where each element satisfies -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9, r is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9, visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.
