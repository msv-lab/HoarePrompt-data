The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `a` was not previously defined. After the execution of the code, `a` will hold the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

Output State: **`t` (which is `a` after the input) is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive; for each test case, `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.**
