The only object in the loop head is the variable `test`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least 1 test case, the loop will execute. 

Given the description, the state before the loop should ensure that `test_cases` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `test_cases` contains at least one test case.

The initial state provided is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
- `results` is an empty list.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the state already ensures that `test_cases` is not empty. Therefore, no further adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6 for each `i`, `results` is an empty list**.
