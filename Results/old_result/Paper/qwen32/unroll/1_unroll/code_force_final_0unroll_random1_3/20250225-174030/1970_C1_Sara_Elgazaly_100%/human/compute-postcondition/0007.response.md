Output State: **`lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it in the direction away from the key node; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it in the direction towards the key node; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is assigned the value of `z`; `one` is `True`.**

In natural language: The state of `lst` and `rev` as default dictionaries of lists remains unchanged. The variable `z` retains its value as an input integer, and `tmp` is set to the same value as `z`. Additionally, the variable `one` is set to `True`.
