You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers reflecting the values of the last test case, `s` is a string of length `m` reflecting the string of the last test case, `cnt` is an integer representing the count of valid substrings in the last test case, `cur` is an integer representing the bitmask of characters seen in the last test case, and `ans` is a string constructed based on the conditions of the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if there are at least `n` distinct substrings of `s` that contain all `k` unique characters. If so, it outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO' and constructs a string that includes the missing characters and additional 'a's to meet the requirement of `n` substrings.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`. If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Key Points:
1. **Subsequence**: A string `a` is a subsequence of another string `b` if `a` can be obtained by deleting some characters from `b` without changing the order of the remaining characters.
2. **Combinatorics**: There are `k^n` possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
3. **Checking Subsequences**: The program needs to check if each of these `k^n` strings appears as a subsequence in `s`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a bitmask approach to track the presence of subsequences. However, the logic seems flawed because:
1. **Bitmask Logic**: The program uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track which of the `k` characters have been seen in sequence. This bitmask approach is not sufficient to check for all possible subsequences of length `n`.
2. **Counting Subsequences**: The program increments `cnt` when the bitmask is filled (indicating all `k` characters have been seen), but this does not ensure that all subsequences of length `n` have been seen.
3. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The logic for generating a missing subsequence is incorrect. It appends characters to `ans` based on the bitmask, which does not guarantee a valid missing subsequence.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The bitmask approach does not adequately check for all possible subsequences of length `n`, and the logic for generating a missing subsequence is flawed.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
