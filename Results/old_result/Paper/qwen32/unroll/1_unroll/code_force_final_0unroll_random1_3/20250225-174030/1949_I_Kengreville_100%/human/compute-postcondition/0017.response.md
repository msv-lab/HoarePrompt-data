Postcondition: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values (some of which may be `True` after the loop), `coef` is a list of `n` integers (some of which may be `1` after the loop), `tot` is an integer (potentially modified by the loop), `bipartite` is a boolean (potentially modified by the loop), and `ok` is a boolean. If `ok` is `True`, the current value of `ok` remains `True`. If `ok` is `False`, the value of `ok` remains `False`.**
