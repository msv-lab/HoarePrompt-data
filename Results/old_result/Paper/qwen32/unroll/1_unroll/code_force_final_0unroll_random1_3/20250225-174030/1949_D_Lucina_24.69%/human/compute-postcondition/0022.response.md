Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` matrix where each cell is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (if the row index equals the column index). It processes the matrix to replace '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column, and prints the modified matrix. If there are more or equal 'F' counts without 'S' compared to 'S' counts without 'F', it prioritizes 'F' for undecided cells in the first `n // 4` rows or columns identified as having only 'F'. Otherwise, it prioritizes 'S'.**
