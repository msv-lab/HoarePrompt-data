Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and 0 <= k <= (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even. Additionally, `k` is even. `max_k` is set to ((n^2 - 1) // 2) if `n` is odd, and `max_k` is set to (n^2 // 2) if `n` is even. `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`.**
