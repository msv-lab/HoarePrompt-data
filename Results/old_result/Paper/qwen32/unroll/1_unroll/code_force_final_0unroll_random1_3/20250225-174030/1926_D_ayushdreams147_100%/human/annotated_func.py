#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j < 2^31.

    res = 0

    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1

    #State: `res` is the count of unique numbers (or their bitwise complements) that do not have a matching counterpart in the list `a`. `count` is a dictionary containing unmatched numbers or their complements with non-zero counts. `n`, `a` remain unchanged.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the count of unique numbers (or their bitwise complements) that do not have a matching counterpart in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique numbers (or their bitwise complements) that do not have a matching counterpart in the list `a`.
