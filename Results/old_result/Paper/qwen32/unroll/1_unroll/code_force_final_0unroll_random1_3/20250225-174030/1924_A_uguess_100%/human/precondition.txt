t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, k, m) such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, 1 <= m <= 1000, and a string s of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
