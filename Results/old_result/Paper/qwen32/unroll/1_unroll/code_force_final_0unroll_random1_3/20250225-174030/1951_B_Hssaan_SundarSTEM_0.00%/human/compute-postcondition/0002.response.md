Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, an integer `k` representing a specific position, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.**
