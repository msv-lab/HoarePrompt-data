The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input using the lambda function `R` and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen remain unchanged as they are not referenced in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers.**
