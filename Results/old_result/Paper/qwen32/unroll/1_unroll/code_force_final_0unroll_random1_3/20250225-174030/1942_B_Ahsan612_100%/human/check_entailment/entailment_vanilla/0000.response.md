Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the array `a` according to the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array up to that point.

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `res` (the result array `p`) with `None` values.
   - It sets `mex` to `n` (initially the maximum possible value for `MEX`).

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over `ar` (the array `a`) in reverse order.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, it prints the constructed permutation `p`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates over `ar` in reverse order, which is not consistent with the definition of `MEX` and the problem's requirements. `MEX` is dependent on the elements encountered up to the current position, not in reverse.
- **MEX Calculation**: The `mex` variable is not updated correctly. The program does not maintain a set of used numbers to calculate the `MEX` correctly.
- **Updating `mex`**: The update `mex = min(mex, mex - ar[i])` is incorrect and does not reflect the logic of finding the minimum non-negative integer not in the current subset of `p`.

### Correct Approach:
- **Forward Iteration**: Iterate over `ar` from the start.
- **Tracking Used Numbers**: Maintain a set or a boolean array to track which numbers have been used in `p`.
- **Calculate `MEX`**: For each position `i`, find the smallest non-negative integer not in the set of used numbers.
- **Construct `p`**: Set `p[i] = MEX - a[i]` and add `p[i]` to the set of used numbers.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to construct the permutation `p` from the array `a`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
