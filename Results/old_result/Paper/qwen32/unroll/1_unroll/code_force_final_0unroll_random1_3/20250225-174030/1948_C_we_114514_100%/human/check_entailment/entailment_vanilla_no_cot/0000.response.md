Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description and constraints. The logic in `func_1` is too simplistic and does not fully account for all possible paths and scenarios that the robot can take to reach the target cell.

Here are some reasons why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Limited Path Checking**: The function `func_1` only checks for certain specific conditions related to the arrows in the grid, but it does not simulate the actual movement of the robot through the grid. The robot can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) and must follow the arrows accordingly, which the current function does not handle.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Grid Movement**: The robot's movement is not accurately represented. The function checks for specific patterns in the arrows but does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step through the grid, which is necessary to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

3. **No Loop for Movement Simulation**: The function does not include a loop to simulate the robot's movement through the grid over time. It only checks for certain conditions that are not sufficient to determine the robot's ability to reach the target cell.

A correct solution would involve simulating the robot's movement through the grid, checking all possible paths, and ensuring that the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) following the rules provided in the problem description.
