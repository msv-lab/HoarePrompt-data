### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded according to a specific algorithm. The decoding process involves the following steps:

1. **Construct the auxiliary string `r`:** This string consists of the distinct characters from the encoded string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.

2. **Create a mapping:** Each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r` (i.e., the first character in `r` maps to the last, the second maps to the second last, and so on).

3. **Decode the string `b`:** Each character in `b` is replaced using the mapping created in the previous step to produce the original string `s`.

Let's verify if the program correctly implements these steps:

- **Step 1:** `r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))` correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` by taking the unique characters from `encoded`, sorting them, and joining them into a string.
  
- **Step 2:** `mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}` creates the correct mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart.

- **Step 3:** `''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)` correctly decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding mapped value.

The program processes multiple test cases by iterating through the input and applying the decoding function `func_1` to each encoded string.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
