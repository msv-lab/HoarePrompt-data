Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `b` to store elements based on the commands.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` (starting from the left) and `r` (starting from the right), to track the elements to be removed based on the commands.

3. **Building the `b` List:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and appends elements to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends `a[l]` to `b` and increments `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends `a[r]` to `b` and decrements `r`.

4. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to compute the product of elements.
   - It then iterates through the elements of `b` in reverse order, updating `p` by multiplying it with the current element and taking the remainder when divided by `m`.
   - It appends the computed remainder to `ans`.

5. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns the reversed `ans` list, which should contain the remainders in the correct order.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of elements in the reverse order of `b`, which is incorrect. The problem requires the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step, not the product of the elements in `b`.
   - For example, in the first test case, the product should be calculated as `3*1*4*2 % 6`, then `1*4*2 % 6`, then `1*4 % 6`, and finally `1 % 6`.

2. **Handling of Product Calculation:**
   - The product calculation should be done on the original array `a` while removing elements based on the commands, not on the `b` list.
   - The product should be updated after each removal of an element, and the remainder should be computed and stored.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program is incorrect. It does not correctly compute the remainders as required by the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
