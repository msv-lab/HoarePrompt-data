To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n_cases`.

### Analysis:
1. **`n_cases`**: This variable represents the number of test cases and is a given integer in the range `1 ≤ n_cases ≤ 10^4`. Since `n_cases` is already defined and within the valid range, no adjustment is needed for `n_cases` itself.
2. **`i`**: This is the loop variable that will iterate from `0` to `n_cases - 1`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be explicitly set because the `range` function in Python will automatically initialize `i` to `0` at the start of the loop.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute as long as `n_cases` is at least 1. Since `n_cases` is already defined and within the valid range, no adjustment is necessary for `n_cases`. The variable `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts because it will be initialized by the `range` function.

### Final State:
State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ n_cases ≤ 10^4`**.

This state already ensures that the loop will execute because `n_cases` is within the valid range, and `i` will be correctly initialized by the `range` function.
