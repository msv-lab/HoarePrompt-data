The code snippet reads an integer `tc` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `t`, `n`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `tc` is an input integer; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.**
