Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m` and then calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation up to `mn` minutes. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it adds an additional 1 to the result. 

However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Overlapping Fireworks**: The program does not correctly account for all scenarios where fireworks from both installations could overlap and be visible simultaneously. The additional `+1` is not a reliable way to account for all overlaps.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where `a` or `b` is 1, which would mean fireworks are launched every minute. In such cases, the number of fireworks visible is much higher and the current logic does not capture this correctly.

3. **General Overlap Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks. It needs to consider all possible overlaps within the range of `mn` minutes, not just the divisibility of `m`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
