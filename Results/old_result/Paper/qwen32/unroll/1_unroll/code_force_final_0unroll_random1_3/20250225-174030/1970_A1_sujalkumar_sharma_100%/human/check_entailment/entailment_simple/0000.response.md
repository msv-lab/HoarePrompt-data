### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `prefix_balance` as an empty list and `balance` as 0.
   - It then iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
   - For each character, it appends a tuple to `prefix_balance` containing the current `balance`, the index `i` of the character, and the character itself.
   - If the character is `'('`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - This ensures that `prefix_balance` contains the balance of the prefix before each character, along with the character's index and the character itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `prefix_balance` is sorted using a custom key in the `sort` function.
   - The key is a tuple `(x[0], -x[1])`, meaning the list is sorted first by the balance in increasing order, and in case of ties, by the position in decreasing order.
   - This sorting step ensures that characters with lower prefix balances come earlier in the result, and in case of ties, characters that appear later in the original sequence come earlier.

3. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by concatenating the third element (the character) of each tuple in `prefix_balance`.
   - This results in a new parentheses sequence formed by the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

4. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the input `"(()(()))"`, the prefix balance table would be:
     ```
     Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
     ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
     Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
     Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )
     ```
   - After sorting:
     ```
     Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
     ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
     Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
     Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
     ```
   - The result string formed by concatenating the characters is `"()(()())"`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The sorting and construction steps ensure that the output is a valid balanced shuffle of the input sequence.
