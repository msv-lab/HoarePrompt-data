Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by using a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subsegments of array `a` for each test case. Here is a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a count array `cnt_b` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in array `b`. This is done to efficiently check how many elements in a subsegment of `a` match elements in `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It updates the `cnt_b` array based on the elements in `b`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program first processes the first subsegment of length `m` in `a` to count how many elements match elements in `b`. This is stored in `curr`.
   - It then slides the window one element at a time from left to right across `a`. For each new position of the window:
     - It updates `cnt_b` and `curr` to reflect the removal of the element that is no longer in the window and the addition of the new element that has entered the window.
     - It checks if the current window is a good subsegment by comparing `curr` with `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it outputs the number of good subsegments found.

5. **Resetting for Next Test Case**:
   - After processing each test case, the program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b` to zero to prepare for the next test case.

The logic and implementation are correct and efficient given the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
