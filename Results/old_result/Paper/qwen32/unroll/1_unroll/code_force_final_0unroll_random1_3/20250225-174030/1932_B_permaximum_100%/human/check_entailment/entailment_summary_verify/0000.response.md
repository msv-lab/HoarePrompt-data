Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
The Chaya tribe believes that the i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years. For the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur sequentially. This means that after the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the next sign can only occur in a year `y` such that `y > x` and `y` is a multiple of `a_(i+1)`.

### Provided Code:
The code reads the number of test cases and their respective periodicities, then calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur for each test case. This is done by iterating through each periodicity and determining the next occurrence year based on the current year.

### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary provided is somewhat misleading. It states that the function returns the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case's list. However, this is not the case. The function actually calculates the year in which each sign will occur sequentially, not the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities.

### Code Analysis:
Let's walk through the code logic:
1. **Initialization**: `current_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Iteration through signs**: For each periodicity `ai`:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur in `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur in the next multiple of `ai`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
3. **Updating current_year**: `current_year` is updated to `next_year`.
4. **Storing results**: The final `current_year` for each test case is stored in the results list.
5. **Output**: The results are printed.

### Correctness Verification:
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It ensures that each sign occurs in the correct year based on the previous sign's occurrence year and the periodicity of the current sign.

### Edge Cases:
- **All periodicities are 1**: The signs will occur every year sequentially, so the n-th sign will occur in year `n`.
- **Larger periodicities**: The code correctly calculates the next occurrence year by finding the next multiple of `ai`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
