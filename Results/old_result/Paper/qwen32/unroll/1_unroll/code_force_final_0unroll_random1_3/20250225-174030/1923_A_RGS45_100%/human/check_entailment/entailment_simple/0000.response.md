### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and see if it correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the configuration of the ribbon `arr` (a string of '0's and '1's). The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to move all chips into a contiguous block.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. `arr = ''.join(input('').split())`: This line reads the ribbon configuration and removes any spaces.
2. `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first '1' in the ribbon configuration.
3. `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first '1' in the reversed ribbon configuration, effectively finding the index of the last '1' in the original configuration.
4. `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This creates a substring `z` from the first '1' to the last '1'. The `n - y` part is the correct way to get the index of the last '1' in the original string.
5. `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's in the substring `z`, which represents the number of free cells between the first and last '1'. This count is the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a contiguous block.

The program's logic is correct because:
- It correctly identifies the range of cells between the first and last '1'.
- It counts the number of free cells within this range, which is the number of moves required to bring all chips together.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- `x` (index of first '1'): 1
- `y` (index of last '1' in reversed string): 1 (which corresponds to index 6 in the original string)
- `z`: `arr[1:7]` which is `1 1 1 0 1 1`
- `z.count('0')`: 1

This matches the expected output of 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
