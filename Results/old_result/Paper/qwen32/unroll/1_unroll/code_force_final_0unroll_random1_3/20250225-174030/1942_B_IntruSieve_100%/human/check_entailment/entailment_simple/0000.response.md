### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and check if it correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a` of length `n`.
3. It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`, a variable `minn` to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not used in `p`, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the numbers already used in `p`.
4. For each element in `a`, it checks if the element is positive:
   - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex`, marks `minn` as used, and increments `minn` until it finds the next smallest unused non-negative integer.
   - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it calculates the next element of `p` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, appends it to `mex`, and marks this value as used.
5. After constructing the permutation `p` (stored in `mex`), it prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

However, there is a fundamental flaw in this approach. The program does not correctly compute the permutation `p` based on the definition of `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Specifically, the logic for handling negative values of `a_i` is incorrect. The correct approach should involve directly calculating the MEX for each position and ensuring that the permutation `p` satisfies the given `a`.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:
- For each `i`, calculate `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_{i-1})`.
- Set `p_i` to `MEX - a_i`.
- Ensure that `p_i` is not already used and is within the valid range `[0, n-1]`.

The provided program does not follow this corrected logic, especially in handling negative values of `a_i`. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**False**
