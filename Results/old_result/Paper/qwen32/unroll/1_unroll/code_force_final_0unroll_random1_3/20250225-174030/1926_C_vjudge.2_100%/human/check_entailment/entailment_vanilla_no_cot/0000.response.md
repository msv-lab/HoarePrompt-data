Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The main issue lies in the way the prefix sum array `pd` is being constructed and used. Specifically:

1. The line `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` is incorrect because it should be adding the sum of the digits of `i` to the previous prefix sum, not just incrementing `pd[i]` based on the previous value.

2. The loop `for j in str(i): pd[i] += int(j)` should be outside the `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` line to ensure the digit sum is calculated correctly before adding it to the prefix sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        digit_sum = sum(int(j) for j in str(i))
        pd[i] = pd[i - 1] + digit_sum
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])

func()
```

In this corrected version, the sum of the digits of `i` is calculated and then added to the previous prefix sum to form the current prefix sum. This ensures that `pd[i]` contains the correct sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.
