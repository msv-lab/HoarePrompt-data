To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet and the initial state given:

1. `n` and `k` are integers updated by `func_7()`. We don't know the exact values of `n` and `k` after `func_7()` is called, but we know the constraints: `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.
2. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
3. `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
4. If `k` is equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is `[2, 3]` extended by `2`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the first `l * k - 1` powers of 2, followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from `2`.

Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we'll consider the general case where `k` is not necessarily equal to 1.

Let's break down the construction of `ans`:
- `ans` starts with the first `l * k - 1` powers of 2.
- Then, it includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`.
- Finally, it includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from `2`.

The final step is to return the length of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` as a space-separated string.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact list `ans` or its length. However, we can describe the format of the output.

Output State: **The program returns the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` as a space-separated string.**

In natural language: The output consists of two parts. The first part is the number of elements in the list `ans`. The second part is the list `ans` itself, with each element separated by a space. The list `ans` is constructed based on the values of `n` and `k` after they are updated by `func_7()`.
