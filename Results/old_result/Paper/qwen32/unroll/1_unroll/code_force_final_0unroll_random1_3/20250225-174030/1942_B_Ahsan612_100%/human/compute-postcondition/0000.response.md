In the given code snippet, the loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and the `range` function with `int(input())` as its argument.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. This value corresponds to `t`, the number of test cases. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is at least 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once, as required by the problem statement. The other variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
