The provided code snippet is a function definition and does not contain any executable code that would change the state of the variables `t` or `test_cases`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged. Since there is no return statement or any other operation that modifies the variables, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
