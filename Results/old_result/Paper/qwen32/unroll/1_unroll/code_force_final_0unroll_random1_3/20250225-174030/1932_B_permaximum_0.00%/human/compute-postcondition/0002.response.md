Output State: **For each test case, the variable `year` will hold the cumulative sum calculated by the inner loop, where for each integer `ai` in the list `a`, `year` is incremented by `year % ai` if `year % ai` is not zero, otherwise it is incremented by `ai`. The final value of `year` for each test case is printed. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will not retain their values after the loop completes the iteration for that test case.**
