The code snippet provided reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. Given the initial state, this line of code will convert the input string into a list of strings, which will contain the integers `n` and `q` followed by the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and then the query pairs `l` and `r`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by spaces. The initial state of `n`, `q`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and the query pairs `l` and `r` are represented as strings within the `data` list.**

In natural language, the output state means that the input has been read and split into a list of strings called `data`. This list contains the values of `n`, `q`, the elements of the array `a`, and the query pairs `l` and `r`, all as strings.
