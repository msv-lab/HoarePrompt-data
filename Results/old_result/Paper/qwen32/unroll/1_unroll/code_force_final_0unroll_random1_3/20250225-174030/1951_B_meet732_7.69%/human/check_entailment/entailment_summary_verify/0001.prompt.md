You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if k == 14:
        print(ind)
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list `a` containing multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a list starting with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function determines and returns a value based on the ratings relative to the cow at index `k`. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, an index minus one, or the maximum or minimum of certain differences between indices, depending on the conditions met during execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Tournament:**
   - There are `n` cows, each with a unique Cowdeforces rating.
   - The tournament consists of `n-1` matches.
   - The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2.
   - Subsequent matches are between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line.
   - The cow with the higher rating wins each match.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve, either by doing nothing or by swapping positions with another cow once.

2. **Strategy:**
   - Determine the number of cows that have a higher rating than cow `k`.
   - If cow `k` is in position 1, it can only win matches until it encounters a cow with a higher rating.
   - If cow `k` is in any other position, it can potentially swap with a cow in a position that maximizes its chances of winning more matches.

### Program Analysis

The provided program has several issues:

1. **Variable `n` is not defined in `func_1`:**
   - `n` is defined in the main loop but not passed to `func_1`.
   - This will result in a `NameError` when `func_1` tries to use `n`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Wins:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum wins is flawed.
   - The program checks the first two cows with a higher rating and makes decisions based on their positions, but it does not consider the optimal swap strategy.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case when cow `k` can swap with another cow to maximize its wins.

3. **Debugging Statements:**
   - The program includes a debugging statement `if k == 14: print(ind)`, which should be removed or commented out in the final version.

4. **Incorrect Return Values:**
   - The return values in `func_1` do not correctly reflect the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.
   - For example, `if ind == []: return n - 1` is incorrect because cow `k` cannot win all matches if there are cows with higher ratings.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect. It does not correctly calculate the maximum number of wins for cow `k` and contains logical errors and undefined variables.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
