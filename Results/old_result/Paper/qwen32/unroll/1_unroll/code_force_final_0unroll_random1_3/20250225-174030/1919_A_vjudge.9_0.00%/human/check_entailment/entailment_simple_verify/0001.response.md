To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's systematically analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

### Problem Analysis
The game's key dynamics are:
- Players take turns.
- Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
- After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Optimal Play Insight
The critical insight is that the game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `(a + b)`:
- If `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
- If `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation of the Program
The program consists of two functions:
- **`func_1(a, b)`**: Determines the winner based on the sum of coins in both wallets.
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
- **`func_2()`**: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
  - Calls `func_1` to determine the winner and appends the result.
  - Prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification of the Logic
The logic implemented in `func_1` is correct based on the problem analysis:
- If the total number of coins is even, the first player (Alice) can always be forced into a losing position if both play optimally.
- If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a losing position.

### Annotations Analysis
The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code are consistent with the logic explained:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after key operations.
- The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` correctly returns 'Bob' if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and 'Alice' otherwise.
- The annotations also confirm that the function `func_2` correctly reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Conclusion
The logic implemented in `func_1` is correct based on the problem analysis, and the annotations support this conclusion. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **True**
