Reasoning:
The given program calculates the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to n for multiple test cases. The program first creates a prefix sum array `pd` where `pd[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to i. This is done by iterating over each number from 1 to N (where N is the maximum possible value for n, which is 200,001 in this case), converting the number to a string to access each digit, converting each digit back to an integer, and adding it to the cumulative sum stored in `pd[i]`. 

For each test case, the program reads the value of n, and then prints `pd[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to n.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the required sum of digit sums for each test case. The prefix sum array `pd` is computed only once, making the program efficient enough to handle up to 10,000 test cases within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Correctness: **True**
