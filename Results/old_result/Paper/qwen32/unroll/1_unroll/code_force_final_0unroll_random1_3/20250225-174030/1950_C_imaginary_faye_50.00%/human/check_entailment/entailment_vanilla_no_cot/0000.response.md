Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a couple of issues that need to be addressed for it to work correctly.

1. **Leading Zeroes in Hours:** The program incorrectly handles the conversion of hours to 12-hour format. For instance, when converting hours greater than 12, it incorrectly prepends a '0' to the hour, which is not always necessary. For example, converting 13:00 should result in 01:00 PM, not 01:00 PM.

2. **Handling of Midnight and Noon:** The program correctly identifies '00' as midnight and '12' as noon, but it does not correctly format the output for these cases. Specifically, '00:00' should be '12:00 AM', and '12:00' should be '12:00 PM'.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        m = s[2:]
        period = 'AM'
        
        if h >= 12:
            period = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h -= 12
        elif h == 0:
            h = 12
        
        print(f"{h:02}:{m} {period}")

func_1()
```

This corrected version handles all edge cases correctly and formats the output as required.
