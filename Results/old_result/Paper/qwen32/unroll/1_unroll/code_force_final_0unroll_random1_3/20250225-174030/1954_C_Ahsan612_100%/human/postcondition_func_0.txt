The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, composed only of digits from 1 to 9. For each test case, it generates two new numbers: one where the digits are the maximum of the corresponding digits in `x` and `y` up to the first differing position, followed by the minimum of the remaining digits, and another where the digits are the minimum of the corresponding digits in `x` and `y` up to the first differing position, followed by the maximum of the remaining digits. It prints these two numbers for each test case.
