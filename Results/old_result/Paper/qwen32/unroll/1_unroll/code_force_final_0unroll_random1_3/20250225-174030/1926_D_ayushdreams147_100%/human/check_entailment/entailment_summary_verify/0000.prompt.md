You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
            if count[num] == 0:
                del count[num]
    return res



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique numbers (or their bitwise complements) that do not have a matching counterpart in the list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum number of groups needed such that no two numbers in the same group share any matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit in their binary representation. However, the current implementation does not achieve this correctly.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
            if count[num] == 0:
                del count[num]
    return res
```

The key issue lies in the use of `count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num]`. This operation inverts the 31 least significant bits of `num` and uses it as a key in the dictionary. This is not the correct approach to determine if numbers can be grouped based on the condition given in the problem.

Instead, the correct approach would involve checking the binary representation of each number and ensuring that no two numbers in the same group share any matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. A correct approach might involve using a set to track the groups based on the binary representation of the numbers.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue with the current code:

Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 4 8
```

The binary representations are:
- 1: `0000000000000000000000000000001`
- 2: `0000000000000000000000000000010`
- 4: `0000000000000000000000000000100`
- 8: `0000000000000000000000000001000`

These numbers can all be placed in the same group because they do not share any matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. However, the provided code will output `4` for this input, indicating that each number is placed in a separate group, which is incorrect.

Thus, the code is incorrect.
