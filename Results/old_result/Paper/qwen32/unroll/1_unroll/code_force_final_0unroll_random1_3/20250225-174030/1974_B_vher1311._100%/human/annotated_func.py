#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n over the tuples does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string where each character from all strings in `encoded` has been replaced by its mirrored counterpart from the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a string of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a single string where each character from the input strings is replaced by its mirrored counterpart based on a specific mapping derived from the unique characters in the input strings.
