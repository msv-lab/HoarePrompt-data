Postcondition: **`n` is equal to 2, `k` is equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with `n` and `k` updated to the values returned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, which is '10'. `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, which is 2.**
