### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to verify its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have multiple test cases, each with 2n integers.
   - We need to perform n moves where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the smaller one to our score, and removing both from the board.
   - The goal is to maximize the score after n moves.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the score, we should aim to add the largest possible minimum values in each move. 
   - Sorting the list of integers allows us to easily pick pairs such that the smaller value in each pair is as large as possible.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - For each test case, we read the number of integers (2n) and the integers themselves.
   - We sort the list of integers.
   - We then iterate over the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score. This is because, after sorting, the pairs (l[0], l[1]), (l[2], l[3]), ..., (l[2n-2], l[2n-1]) will always have the property that l[0] ≤ l[1], l[2] ≤ l[3], ..., l[2n-2] ≤ l[2n-1]. Therefore, l[0], l[2], ..., l[2n-2] are the smallest values in each respective pair, which we want to sum up to maximize the score.

4. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For the input `1 1 2 3`, after sorting, we get `[1, 2, 3]`. The pairs are `(1, 2)` and `(3)`. The score is `1 + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3`, but since we only need to pick one pair, the score is `1`.
   - For the input `2 1 1 2 1`, after sorting, we get `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. The pairs are `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. The score is `1 + min(1, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the input `3 1 1 1 1 1 1`, after sorting, we get `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`. The score is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy by sorting the list and summing every second element.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
