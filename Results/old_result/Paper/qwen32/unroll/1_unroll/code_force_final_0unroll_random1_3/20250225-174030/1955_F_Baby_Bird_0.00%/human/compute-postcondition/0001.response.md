To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the input values.

The loop processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads four integers `p1, p2, p3, p4` which represent the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence.
2. It creates a list `p` by subtracting the remainder of each of these integers when divided by 2 (effectively making all values in `p` even).
3. It checks if the first three elements of `p` are all odd (which is impossible since they are made even in the previous step, so this condition will always be false).
4. It calculates the sum of the list `p` and divides it by 2 (integer division).
5. It prints the result of the condition (which is 0) plus the sum of `p` divided by 2.

Let's break down the steps with an example:
- Suppose the input is `p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, p4=6`.
- After the operation `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`, `p` becomes `[2, 4, 4, 6]`.
- The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all of the first three elements are odd, which is false, so it evaluates to 0.
- The sum of `p` is `2 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 16`, and `16 // 2 = 8`.
- The final printed value is `0 + 8 = 8`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the output is printed immediately after processing each test case, the state of the variables `p1, p2, p3, p4` does not change between iterations. The output for each test case is solely dependent on the input values for that test case.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations is simply the sequence of outputs for each test case. However, since the problem asks for the output state in a specific format and the variables `p1, p2, p3, p4` do not change between iterations, we can describe the output state as the unchanged input values for the last test case processed.

Output State: **p1, p2, p3, p4** (unchanged from the last test case input values). 

If we need to provide a concrete example based on the last test case, let's assume the last test case was `p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, p4=6`:

Output State: **3, 4, 5, 6**.
