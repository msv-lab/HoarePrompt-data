Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square based on the given criteria. The program checks if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's to determine if the shape is a square, which is not sufficient to accurately classify the shape.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Triangle Detection**: The program does not check the pattern of '1's in the rows to determine if they form a triangle. For a triangle, the number of '1's in the i-th row should be 2*i - 1, and they should be centered.
2. **Square Detection**: The program only checks if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's. This is not enough to confirm that the shape is a square. It should verify that every row with '1's has the same number of '1's and that they are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.
3. **Upside Down Triangle**: The program does not handle upside down triangles, which should also be recognized as triangles.
4. **General Shape Verification**: The program does not ensure that the shape is fully formed (i.e., no '1's are missing that should be part of the shape).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
- Identify the rows that contain '1's.
- Check if the number of '1's in each row matches the pattern of a square (all rows with '1's have the same number of '1's) or a triangle (the number of '1's in the i-th row is 2*i - 1 and they are centered).
- Ensure that the shape is fully formed and that there are no '1's that do not fit the pattern of a square or triangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    rows_with_ones = [row.count('1') for row in grid if '1' in row]
    if len(rows_with_ones) == 0:
        return False
    k = rows_with_ones[0]
    return all(count == k for count in rows_with_ones)

def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    rows_with_ones = [row.count('1') for row in grid if '1' in row]
    if len(rows_with_ones) == 0:
        return False
    k = len(rows_with_ones)
    for i, count in enumerate(rows_with_ones):
        if count != 2 * (i + 1) - 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_upside_down_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    grid_reversed = grid[::-1]
    return is_triangle(grid_reversed)

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        if is_square(grid):
            print('SQUARE')
        elif is_triangle(grid) or is_upside_down_triangle(grid):
            print('TRIANGLE')
        else:
            print('UNKNOWN')  # This line is just a safeguard; according to problem statement, it should never reach here

func()
```

This corrected program checks both the square and triangle conditions, including upside down triangles, and prints the correct shape for each test case.
