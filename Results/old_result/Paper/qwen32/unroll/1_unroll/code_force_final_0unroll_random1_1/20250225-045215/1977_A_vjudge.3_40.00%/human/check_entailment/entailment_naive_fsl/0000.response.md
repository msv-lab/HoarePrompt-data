Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves for all possible values of `n` and `m`. The logic in the program is flawed and does not cover all cases.

Let's analyze the conditions in the code:

1. `if n == m:` - This condition checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes. This is correct because if `n` moves are made and `n` cubes are needed, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
2. `elif m > n:` - This condition checks if the number of cubes required is greater than the number of moves. This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.
3. `elif m == n - 1:` - This condition checks if the number of cubes required is one less than the number of moves. This is also correct because Nikita can add a cube `n-1` times and remove one cube once.
4. `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` - This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. This is incorrect because having even moves and even cubes does not guarantee that the final number of cubes can be exactly `m`.
5. `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` - This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. This is also incorrect because having odd moves and odd cubes does not guarantee that the final number of cubes can be exactly `m`.
6. `else:` - This condition handles all other cases and prints "No". This is incorrect because it does not cover the cases where the number of cubes can be achieved through a combination of adding and removing cubes.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
4 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Yes
```

Explanation:
Nikita can add a cube 3 times and remove a cube 1 time, resulting in a tower with 2 cubes.

However, the provided program will output "No" for this input. This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is greater than `m` and the difference can be achieved through a combination of adding and removing cubes.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
