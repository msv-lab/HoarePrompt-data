The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input using the lambda function `R`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases.

Given the initial state, the value of `t` is updated by reading the input through `R()`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value returned by `R()`, which represents the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to integers.**
