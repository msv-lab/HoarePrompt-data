Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is intended to decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`, but it does not achieve this correctly. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function attempts to replace characters in `s` with characters from `unique_chars` in reverse order. However, it does not correctly map each character in the encoded string `b` back to its original character in `s`. Instead, it tries to replace characters in `s` (which is actually `b` in the context of the main function) directly, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The function creates a list of unique characters from `b` and sorts them. However, it then attempts to insert characters back into `unique_chars` if they are not found, which is not needed for decoding. The decoding process should map each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars` without modifying `unique_chars` after its initial creation.

3. **Logic for Decoding**: The decoding process should involve creating a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart and then using this mapping to transform `b` back to `s`. The current implementation does not create such a mapping and instead tries to replace characters in place, which leads to incorrect results.

4. **Output**: The function returns the `unique_chars` list joined into a string, which is not the decoded string `s`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect for the task of decoding the string.

Correctness: **False**
