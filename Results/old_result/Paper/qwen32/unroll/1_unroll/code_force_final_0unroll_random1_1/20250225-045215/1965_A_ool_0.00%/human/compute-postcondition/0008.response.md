To determine the output state after the loop has finished, let's analyze the given loop and the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `A` is initially set to `False`.
   - `not_c` is initially set to `True`.
   - `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `len(set_) - 1`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - If the difference is not greater than 1, `A` is toggled (i.e., `A = not A`).

### Determining the Output State:
- The loop checks whether the elements in `set_` are consecutive integers (i.e., the difference between any two consecutive elements is 1).
- If any pair of consecutive elements in `set_` has a difference greater than 1, `not_c` becomes `False` and the loop exits.
- If all consecutive elements have a difference of 1, `A` will be toggled for each iteration.

### Final Output State:
- `A` will be `True` if the number of iterations (i.e., the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `set_`) is odd.
- `A` will be `False` if the number of iterations is even.
- `not_c` will be `False` if any pair of consecutive elements in `set_` has a difference greater than 1; otherwise, it remains `True`.

### Output State Format:
The output state must include the values of `A` and `not_c` after the loop completes, while the other variables remain unchanged.

### Example Output:
Assuming `set_` is `[1, 2, 3, 5]`, the loop will iterate twice (`i = 1` and `i = 2`). At `i = 2`, the difference between `set_[2]` and `set_[1]` is 2, which is greater than 1, so `not_c` becomes `False`. The loop breaks, and `A` remains `False` because it was toggled once.

Output State: **A is False; not_c is False.**

Let's generalize this in the required format without specific values of `arr`:

Output State: **A is determined by the parity of the number of consecutive elements in set_; not_c is False if any consecutive elements in set_ have a difference greater than 1, otherwise True.**
