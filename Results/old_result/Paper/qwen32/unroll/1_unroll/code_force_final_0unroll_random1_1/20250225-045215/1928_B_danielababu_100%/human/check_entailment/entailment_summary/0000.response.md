### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by iterating through multiple test cases. For each test case, the program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. It then finds the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in the array after adding a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n` to the array.

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` is used to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_1()` is used again to read the length of the array `n`.
   - `func_3()` is used to read the array `arr` of integers.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The array `arr` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted.
   - The maximum value in the array `m` is found, but it is not used in the subsequent steps.
   - The program then iterates through the sorted unique elements of `arr` to determine the maximum frequency of any element after adding a permutation.

3. **Finding the Maximum Frequency:**
   - For each unique element `arr[i]` in the sorted array, the program calculates the index `a` where elements greater than or equal to `arr[i] + n` start using `bisect_left`.
   - The difference `d` between `a` and `i` gives the number of elements that can be adjusted to be equal to `arr[i] + k` for some `k` in the permutation.
   - The maximum value of `d` across all unique elements is the answer.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum frequency for each test case.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:

- **Function `func_1()`:** Correctly reads an integer from input.
- **Function `func_3()`:** Correctly reads a list of integers from input.
- **Sorting and Finding Unique Elements:** The program sorts the unique elements of the array, which is necessary for efficiently finding the maximum frequency.
- **Using `bisect_left`:** This function is used to find the insertion point for `arr[i] + n` in the sorted array, which helps in determining the number of elements that can be adjusted to be equal.
- **Calculating the Maximum Frequency:** The logic of calculating the maximum frequency by iterating through the sorted unique elements and using `bisect_left` is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation to the array. The provided functions and their execution summaries support this conclusion.

**Correctness: True**
