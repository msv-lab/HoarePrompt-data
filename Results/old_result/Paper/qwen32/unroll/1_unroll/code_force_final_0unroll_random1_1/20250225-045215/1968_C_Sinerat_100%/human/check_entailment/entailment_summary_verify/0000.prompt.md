You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it generates and prints a list `a` of length `n` where the first element is `1000` and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the problem description's requirements:

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
- Find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initial Value of \( a_0 \)**:
   - The program initializes \( a[0] \) to 1000, which is a fixed value. This could lead to incorrect results if the chosen \( a[0] \) does not satisfy the modulo conditions for all subsequent elements.

2. **Generating \( a_i \)**:
   - The program sets \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \). While this might work for some cases, it does not guarantee that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) for all \( i \). Specifically, it could lead to scenarios where \( a_i \) is not within the required range or does not satisfy the modulo condition.

### Example to Show Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 1
```
Expected output: An array \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) such that:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1 \)

Let's see what the program outputs:
- \( a[0] = 1000 \)
- \( a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 1 = 1001 \)
- \( a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1001 + 1 = 1002 \)

Check the conditions:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1001 \bmod 1000 = 1 \) (satisfies the condition)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1002 \bmod 1001 = 1 \) (satisfies the condition)

In this specific case, it works. However, let's consider another case:
```
1
3
2 1
```
Expected output: An array \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) such that:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1 \)

Let's see what the program outputs:
- \( a[0] = 1000 \)
- \( a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 2 = 1002 \)
- \( a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1002 + 1 = 1003 \)

Check the conditions:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1002 \bmod 1000 = 2 \) (satisfies the condition)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1003 \bmod 1002 = 1 \) (satisfies the condition)

In this case, it also works. However, the program does not guarantee this for all possible inputs. A more robust approach would be to ensure that \( a[i] \) is constructed in a way that \( a[i] \bmod a[i-1] = x[i] \) for all \( i \).

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not guarantee that the generated array \( a \) will satisfy the conditions for all possible inputs. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.
