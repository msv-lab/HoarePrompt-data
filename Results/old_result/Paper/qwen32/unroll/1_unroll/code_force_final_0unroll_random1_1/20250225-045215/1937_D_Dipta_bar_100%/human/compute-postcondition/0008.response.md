To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and how it modifies the variables `B` and `idx_B` based on the characters in the string `s`.

Given:
- `s` is a string of '<' and '>' characters.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `A` is [0, 2, 6] (remains unchanged).
- `idx_A` is [0, 2, 4] (remains unchanged).
- `B` is initially an empty list.
- `idx_B` is initially an empty list.

The loop iterates over the indices of `s` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`). For each character in `s`:
- If the character is '<', the loop performs the following:
  - Checks if `idx_B` is empty. If it is, it appends `0` to `B`.
  - If `idx_B` is not empty, it calculates `x` as the last element of `B` plus the difference between the last element of `idx_B` and the current index `i`, multiplied by the length of `idx_B`. It then appends `x` to `B`.
  - Appends the current index `i` to `idx_B`.

Since the initial state of `s` is not provided, we can't determine the exact values of `B` and `idx_B` without it. However, we can describe the process and the output state in terms of the operations performed.

Let's assume `s` is a string of a certain length `n` with some combination of '<' and '>' characters. We'll illustrate the process with a hypothetical string `s = "<><>"` (where `n = 4`).

1. **j = 0, i = 3**: `s[3]` is '>'
   - No action is taken because the character is not '<'.
2. **j = 1, i = 2**: `s[2]` is '<'
   - `idx_B` is empty, so `B` becomes `[0]`.
   - `idx_B` becomes `[2]`.
3. **j = 2, i = 1**: `s[1]` is '>'
   - No action is taken because the character is not '<'.
4. **j = 3, i = 0**: `s[0]` is '<'
   - `idx_B` is not empty, so `x = B[-1] + (idx_B[-1] - i) * len(idx_B) = 0 + (2 - 0) * 1 = 2`.
   - `B` becomes `[0, 2]`.
   - `idx_B` becomes `[2, 0]`.

For the string `s = "<><>"`, the final state would be:
- `B` is `[0, 2]`.
- `idx_B` is `[2, 0]`.

However, since the exact string `s` is not provided, we can't determine the exact final values of `B` and `idx_B`. The output state will depend on the specific characters in `s`.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `s = "<<>>"` (where `n = 4`).

1. **j = 0, i = 3**: `s[3]` is '>'
   - No action is taken because the character is not '<'.
2. **j = 1, i = 2**: `s[2]` is '>'
   - No action is taken because the character is not '<'.
3. **j = 2, i = 1**: `s[1]` is '<'
   - `idx_B` is empty, so `B` becomes `[0]`.
   - `idx_B` becomes `[1]`.
4. **j = 3, i = 0**: `s[0]` is '<'
   - `idx_B` is not empty, so `x = B[-1] + (idx_B[-1] - i) * len(idx_B) = 0 + (1 - 0) * 1 = 1`.
   - `B` becomes `[0, 1]`.
   - `idx_B` becomes `[1, 0]`.

For the string `s = "<<>>"`, the final state would be:
- `B` is `[0, 1]`.
- `idx_B` is `[1, 0]`.

Given the problem's format and the need for a concrete example, let's assume `s = "<<>>"` for the final output state.

Output State: **B is [0, 1], idx_B is [1, 0].**
