Output State: **`t` is an input integer, the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with four integers n, f, a, and b, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. This is followed by n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}. The total number of messages across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other details about the test cases remain unchanged as they have not been processed yet.
