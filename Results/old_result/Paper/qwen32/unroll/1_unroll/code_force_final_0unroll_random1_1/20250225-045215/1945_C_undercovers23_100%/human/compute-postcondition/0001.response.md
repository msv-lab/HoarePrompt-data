To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `a` and `n` are not relevant to the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
