You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

The program attempts to solve the problem by using a combination of mathematical operations and loops to determine the k-th card Vladislav lays down. However, there are several issues with the logic that can be demonstrated with specific test cases:

1. **Logic for determining the k-th card**: The program uses a combination of while loops and mathematical operations to determine the k-th card. However, the logic seems to be incorrect for certain values of k and n.

2. **Handling of larger values of n and k**: The program does not handle the constraints properly, especially for larger values of n and k, which might lead to incorrect results.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
10 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
8
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Vladislav lays down the cards in the following order:
  - First, all the odd-numbered cards: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
  - Next, all cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6, 10
  - Next, all cards that are 3 times an odd number: 3, 9 (but 3 and 9 are already used)
  - Next, all cards that are 4 times an odd number: 4, 8
  - And so on...

- The sequence of cards laid down is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 10, 4, 8
- The 8th card in this sequence is 8.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
16
```

The program incorrectly outputs 16 for the above test case, which is not the correct k-th card according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for all potential cases, and the correctness is False.
