### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a robot can navigate from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (2, n) of a 2xN grid, following the arrows in the grid. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it must then move according to the arrow in its new position.

The provided solution includes two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function checks the conditions under which the robot cannot reach the target position (2, n) and returns "No" if such conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns "Yes".
2. `func_2`: This function handles input reading, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

Let's analyze `func_1` more closely:

- **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`), checking specific conditions:
  - If `row1[2 * i + 1]` (an odd-indexed cell in the first row) points left (`<`) and either of the neighboring cells in the second row (`row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]`) also points left (`<`), the function returns "No". This condition identifies situations where the robot would be trapped or unable to progress.
  
- **End Condition**: After the loop, the function checks if the last cell in the first row (`row1[n - 1]`) points left (`<`) and the second-to-last cell in the second row (`row2[n - 2]`) also points left (`<`). If both conditions are true, the function returns "No", indicating that the robot cannot escape from the last column.

- **Return "Yes"**: If none of the conditions preventing the robot from reaching the target are met, the function returns "Yes".

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the correctness of `func_1` using the provided test cases:

1. **First Test Case (n = 4):**
   - `row1`: `>>><`
   - `row2`: `>>><`
   - Analysis: The robot can move as follows: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4). No conditions in `func_1` are violated, so the function should return "Yes".

2. **Second Test Case (n = 2):**
   - `row1`: `><`
   - `row2`: `><`
   - Analysis: The robot can move as follows: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2). No conditions in `func_1` are violated, so the function should return "Yes".

3. **Third Test Case (n = 4):**
   - `row1`: `>>><`
   - `row2`: `>><<`
   - Analysis: The robot cannot escape the last column as `row1[3]` points left and `row2[2]` points left, so the function should return "No".

4. **Fourth Test Case (n = 6):**
   - `row1`: `>><<><`
   - `row2`: `><>>><`
   - Analysis: The robot can move as follows: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6). No conditions in `func_1` are violated, so the function should return "Yes".

All test cases match the expected output, indicating that `func_1` correctly implements the logic for determining whether the robot can reach the target position.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the target position based on the given grid configuration. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

**Correctness: True**
