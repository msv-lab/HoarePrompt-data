The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 'W' or 'B'. For each grid, it determines if it is possible to paint the grid such that all cells in the first row are the same color, all cells in the last row are the same color, all cells in the first column are the same color, and all cells in the last column are the same color, with the additional condition that the top-left and bottom-right cells must be the same color if the grid is to be painted in this manner. The function outputs 'YES' if such a painting is possible for each test case, otherwise it outputs 'NO'.
