In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned, but they are not part of the loop head and are instead part of the loop body. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Let's analyze the loop head:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`.
- The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. This means that `t` is already in a valid state for the loop to execute.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the state of `t` since it is already ensured to be within the valid range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4**
