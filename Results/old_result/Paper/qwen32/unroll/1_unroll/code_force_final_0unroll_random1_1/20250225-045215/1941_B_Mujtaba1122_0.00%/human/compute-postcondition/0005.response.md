The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about a list and a function, but these details do not affect the output of the `print` statement since the statement does not reference any variables or objects defined in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes a list where the first `n` elements are 0, and the rest of the elements are integers.
2. It also mentions a function `func_1(list, n)` that returns `False`, but this function is not called or used in the provided code snippet.
3. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
