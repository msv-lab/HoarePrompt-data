Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the input.
2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: It calculates the prefix balance for each character in the sequence. The prefix balance is the balance of the sequence up to but not including the current character.
3. **Sorting**: It sorts the characters based on their prefix balance in ascending order. In case of a tie (same prefix balance), it sorts by position in descending order.
4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters in the new order.

The program uses a list of tuples to store the prefix balance, position, and character for each position in the sequence. It then sorts this list according to the specified criteria and constructs the final result by joining the characters from the sorted list.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` performs the correct operations to generate the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
