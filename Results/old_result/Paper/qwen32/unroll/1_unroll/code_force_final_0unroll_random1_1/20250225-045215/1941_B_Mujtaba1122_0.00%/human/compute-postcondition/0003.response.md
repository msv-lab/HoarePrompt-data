The given initial state describes a list where the first `n` elements are all 0, and the remaining elements are integers. Additionally, there is a function `func_1` that returns `True` for the given list and `n`. However, the function `func_1` is not relevant to the print statement provided, as the print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on any variables or the result of `func_1`, the output will be exactly the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
