### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine whether Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting a given rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them. According to the problem statement, a different rectangle can be formed if either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) can be evenly divided into two parts such that the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Condition Check**:
    - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
    - If `a` is even, it divides `a` into two equal parts and checks if the resulting part `a // 2` is not equal to `b`.
    - Similarly, if `b` is even, it divides `b` into two equal parts and checks if the resulting part `b // 2` is not equal to `a`.
    - If either condition is true, it prints "Yes", indicating that a different rectangle can be formed.
    - If neither `a` nor `b` is even, or if the resulting parts are equal to the other dimension, it prints "No".

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
    - If `a` is even and `a // 2` is not equal to `b`, then the two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of dimensions `a // 2` by `2 * b`, which is different from `a` by `b`.
    - Similarly, if `b` is even and `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, then the two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of dimensions `b // 2` by `2 * a`, which is different from `a` by `b`.
    - If neither `a` nor `b` is even, or if the resulting parts are equal to the other dimension, then it is impossible to form a different rectangle, and the program correctly prints "No".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a different rectangle can be formed based on the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
