### Reasoning:
The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over each test case, and for each test case, it iterates over the list of periodicities (years in which each sign occurs). The core logic for determining the year in which the nth sign occurs is based on the following line within the loop:

```python
year += year % ai or ai
```

This line adds to the `year` either the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year` or `ai` itself if `year` is zero. This logic ensures that the program correctly identifies the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one.

Let's break down the logic:
- If `year` is zero (which is the case for the first sign), `year % ai` is zero, and thus `year` is increased by `ai`.
- For subsequent signs, `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If this remainder is not zero, it means that `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence of the sign will be in `year + (ai - year % ai)`. This is equivalent to `year + year % ai` if we interpret `year % ai or ai` correctly. If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence will be `year + ai`.

The program correctly implements this logic for each test case and prints the final year for each test case.
