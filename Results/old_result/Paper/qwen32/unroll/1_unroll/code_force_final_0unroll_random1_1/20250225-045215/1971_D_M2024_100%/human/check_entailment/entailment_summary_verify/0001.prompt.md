You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' plus one if there are no '0' to '1' transitions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) we need to cut a binary string into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorted Binary String**: The desired output is a binary string where all '0's appear before any '1's.
2. **Transition Points**: The critical points in the string are where a '1' is followed by a '0' or vice versa. These transitions indicate the points where a cut might be necessary.
3. **Counting Cuts**:
   - If a '1' is followed by a '0', it indicates that the substring must be cut to ensure that '1's do not precede '0's in the final sorted string.
   - Similarly, if a '0' is followed by a '1', it also indicates a necessary cut.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the binary string `a`.
- It initializes counters `cut0` and `cut1` to zero. These counters are meant to track transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', respectively.
- It then iterates through the string and increments `cut1` when it encounters a '1' followed by a '0', and increments `cut0` when it encounters a '0' followed by a '1'.
- After counting the transitions, it checks:
  - If `cut0` is zero (meaning no '0' followed by '1' transitions), it prints `cut1 + 1`. This is because if there are no '0' to '1' transitions, the string can be cut at each '1' to '0' transition and rearranged to form a sorted string. Adding 1 accounts for the initial segment.
  - Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`. This accounts for all transitions, as each transition point needs a cut.

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the necessary cut points based on the transitions between '0's and '1's. However, there is a logical flaw:
- If `cut0` is zero, it means there are no '0' to '1' transitions, which implies the string is already sorted or can be sorted with just the '1' to '0' transitions. Thus, the number of pieces needed is indeed `cut1 + 1` (accounting for the initial segment).
- If `cut0` is not zero, the number of pieces is correctly calculated as `cut0 + cut1`.

The program handles the cases where the string is already sorted, or where it requires cutting at transitions correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the analysis above.

Correctness: **True**
