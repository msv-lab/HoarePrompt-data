### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The original assessment suggests that sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements will yield the maximum beauty. Let's analyze this in more detail.

#### Key Points:
1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the elements are in ascending order.
   - The difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array is maximized compared to any other arrangement.

2. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.
   - In a sorted array, the maximum beauty is achieved by considering the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are maximized.

#### Analysis of the Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
- It sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the difference between the largest and smallest elements.
- It prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program reads the input correctly, sorts the array, and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements.
- The final state of the program is consistent with the expected behavior, as it prints the correct beauty for each test case.

#### Challenge to Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that sorting the array maximizes the beauty.
- The program correctly implements this logic and produces the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. The original assessment is accurate, and the program behaves as expected.

### Final:
Final: **True**
