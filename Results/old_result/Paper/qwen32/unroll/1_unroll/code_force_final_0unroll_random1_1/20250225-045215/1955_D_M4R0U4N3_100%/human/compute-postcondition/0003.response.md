To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the code and understand how the variables are modified during each iteration.

The given code processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. Reads lists `a` and `b`.
3. Initializes a count array `cnt_b` for elements in `b`.
4. Checks how many subarrays of length `m` in `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also in `b`.
5. Prints the number of such subarrays.
6. Resets the count array `cnt_b` for the next test case.

After all test cases are processed, the only variables that will retain their modified state are those that are modified within the loop head and body and are not reset at the end of each iteration. However, in this code, `cnt_b` is reset at the end of each test case, so it does not retain any state across different test cases.

The output state of the program is determined by the printed values for each test case. Since the program prints the answer for each test case immediately and resets the state for the next test case, the final state of the program is simply the printed answers for each test case.

Since the problem asks for the output state in a specific format, and given that the state of `cnt_b` and other variables is reset after each test case, the only state that remains relevant is the printed output for each test case. However, since we are asked to describe the output state in terms of the variables, we can consider the final state of `cnt_b` after all test cases, which is a list of 1000001 zeros.

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros.**
