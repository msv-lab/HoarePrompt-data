Precondition: **The function `func` takes no arguments but operates on input provided through standard input. The input begins with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively, for that test case.**
