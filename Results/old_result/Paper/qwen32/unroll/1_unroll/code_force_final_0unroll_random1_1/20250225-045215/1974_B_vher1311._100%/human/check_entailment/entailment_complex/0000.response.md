### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to decode a string `b` that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The decoding process involves the following steps:

1. **Construct the Auxiliary String `r`:** 
   - Extract all distinct characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - Sort these characters in alphabetical order to form the string `r`.

2. **Create a Mapping:**
   - Create a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character from the end of `r`. For example, if `r` is "cdefors", then 'c' maps to 's', 'd' maps to 'r', and so on.

3. **Decode the Encoded String `b`:**
   - Replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary.
   - Join these characters to form the decoded string.

The function `func_1` correctly implements this decoding process. Here is a detailed breakdown of the function:

- **Line 1:** `r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))`
  - `set(encoded)` extracts unique characters from `encoded`.
  - `sorted(...)` sorts these unique characters alphabetically.
  - `''.join(...)` concatenates the sorted characters into a single string `r`.

- **Line 2:** `mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}`
  - This line creates a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character from the end of `r`.

- **Line 3:** `return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)`
  - This line uses the `mapping` dictionary to replace each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character and joins these characters to form the decoded string.

The main part of the program reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. This matches the problem description and the provided examples.

### Correctness:
The program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` according to the specified algorithm. It handles multiple test cases and ensures that the sum of the lengths of all strings `b` does not exceed the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
