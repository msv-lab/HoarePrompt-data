The code snippet provided initializes an array or list `dp` and sets the first element `dp[1]` to 1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`), but the code snippet only affects `dp[1]`.

After executing the code, the value of `dp[1]` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`, representing the i-th move you made. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `dp[1]` is 1.**
