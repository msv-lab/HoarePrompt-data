Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the prefix sums of the digit sums. Specifically, the line `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` is executed before the digits of `i` are added to `pd[i]`. This means that the prefix sum includes the previous number's digit sum before the current number's digit sum is added. As a result, the prefix sums are incorrect.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        digit_sum = sum(int(j) for j in str(i))
        pd[i] = pd[i - 1] + digit_sum
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])

func()
```

In this corrected version, the digit sum of `i` is calculated first and then added to the prefix sum of the previous number. This ensures that `pd[i]` correctly represents the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.
