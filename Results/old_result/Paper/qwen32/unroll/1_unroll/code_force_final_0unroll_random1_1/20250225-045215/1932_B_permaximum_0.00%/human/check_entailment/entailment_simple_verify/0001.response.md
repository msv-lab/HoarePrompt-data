### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and concludes that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Let's validate this conclusion using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Year:**
   - The `year` variable is initialized to 0.
   - For each sign `ai` in the list `a`, the program updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - Let's break down this expression:
     - `year % ai` computes the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is non-zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence of the sign will be at `year + (ai - year % ai)`. This is equivalent to `year + ai - (year % ai)`, which simplifies to `year + ai - year % ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence will be at `year + ai`.
     - The expression `year % ai or ai` works as follows:
       - If `year % ai` is non-zero, `year + (ai - year % ai)` is used.
       - If `year % ai` is zero, `year + ai` is used.
     - This ensures that `year` is always incremented to the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `year`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `year`, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that the program reads inputs correctly and follows the described logic to compute the year for each test case.
- The annotations also show that the program correctly updates the `year` variable based on the periodicities provided.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities and the sequential requirement of the signs. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
