You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case, and outputs the count of segments where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0', plus one for each string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The logic is based on counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'. Each such transition indicates a necessary cut to separate the segments that need to be rearranged.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Counting Cuts**: For each binary string `s`, it initializes a counter `count` to zero. It then iterates through the string, checking each pair of consecutive characters.
3. **Detecting Cuts**: If a '1' is followed by a '0', it increments the `count` by 1. This represents a necessary cut.
4. **Output**: After processing the string, the program outputs `count + 1`, which represents the minimum number of pieces required.

Let's verify the logic with the example cases:
- **First Test Case**: "11010"
  - Transitions: 1->1 (no cut), 1->0 (cut), 0->1 (cut), 1->0 (cut)
  - Number of cuts: 3
  - Minimum pieces: 3 + 1 = 4 (However, the program outputs 3 + 1 = 4, which seems incorrect as per the problem statement but it should be 3 as per the example output. The correct logic should be to output `count` directly, not `count + 1` as the problem statement suggests the minimum pieces is the number of transitions + 1 but the example output suggests otherwise).
- **Second Test Case**: "00000000"
  - Transitions: None
  - Number of cuts: 0
  - Minimum pieces: 0 + 1 = 1
- **Third Test Case**: "1"
  - Transitions: None
  - Number of cuts: 0
  - Minimum pieces: 0 + 1 = 1
- **Fourth Test Case**: "10"
  - Transitions: 1->0 (cut)
  - Number of cuts: 1
  - Minimum pieces: 1 + 1 = 2
- **Fifth Test Case**: "0001111"
  - Transitions: None
  - Number of cuts: 0
  - Minimum pieces: 0 + 1 = 1
- **Sixth Test Case**: "0110"
  - Transitions: 0->1 (no cut), 1->1 (no cut), 1->0 (cut)
  - Number of cuts: 1
  - Minimum pieces: 1 + 1 = 2

The program seems to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and the provided examples. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the explanation of the output format. The program outputs `count + 1` which seems incorrect based on the example outputs provided. The correct implementation should output `count` directly.

Given the problem statement and the example outputs, the program seems to be correct in its logic, but the output format needs to be adjusted to match the example outputs. Since the task is to verify the correctness based on the provided problem description and examples, and the logic matches the problem description, the program is considered correct.

Correctness: **True**.
