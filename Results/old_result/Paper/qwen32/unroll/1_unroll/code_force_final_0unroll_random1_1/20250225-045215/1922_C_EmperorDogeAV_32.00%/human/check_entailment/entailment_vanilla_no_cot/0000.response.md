Correctness: **False**

The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city and return the cost to travel to the closest city. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the closest city and the cost to travel to it. Specifically, it only considers the immediate forward and backward cities, but it should correctly determine the closest city among all possible cities.

2. **Handling of Pref Sum Arrays**: The prefix sum arrays (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are used to calculate the cumulative cost to travel through the closest cities. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the calculation of these sums, especially since the closest city for each city is not correctly determined.

3. **Logic for Query Handling**: The logic for handling each query is flawed. The code uses the prefix sum arrays to calculate the minimum cost, but since the closest cities are not correctly determined, the results will be incorrect.

To fix these issues, the code needs to correctly determine the closest city for each city and then calculate the prefix sums based on the correct costs. Additionally, the logic for handling each query needs to be corrected to use the correct prefix sums.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Determine closest cities
    closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if cities[i] - cities[i - 1] < cities[i + 1] - cities[i]:
            closest[i] = i - 1
        else:
            closest[i] = i + 1
    closest[0] = 1
    closest[n - 1] = n - 2
    
    # Calculate prefix sums
    pref_sum_f = [0] * n
    pref_sum_b = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        pref_sum_f[i] = pref_sum_f[closest[i]] + 1 if closest[i] != i - 1 else pref_sum_f[i - 1] + (cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        pref_sum_b[i] = pref_sum_b[closest[i]] + 1 if closest[i] != i + 1 else pref_sum_b[i + 1] + (cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
    
    m = int(input())
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        a -= 1
        b -= 1
        if a < b:
            print(pref_sum_f[b] - pref_sum_f[a])
        else:
            print(pref_sum_b[b] - pref_sum_b[a])
```

This corrected version correctly determines the closest city for each city and calculates the prefix sums based on the correct costs. It also correctly handles each query using the correct prefix sums.
