Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. Let's analyze the logic used in the program and compare it to the problem requirements.

The program reads the input, finds the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string representation of the array, and then counts the number of '0's between these two indices. However, this approach does not account for the fact that the chips can only be moved to the left, and the closest free cell to the left of each chip should be considered.

For example, consider the test case:
```
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```
The program finds the first '1' at index 1 and the last '1' at index 7 (from the reversed string, which corresponds to index 2 in the original string). It then counts the number of '0's between indices 1 and 7 (which is 3), but this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is 3, but the program does not correctly simulate the process of moving the chips to the left.

The correct approach would involve iterating through the array and calculating the number of operations required to move each chip to the leftmost possible position, considering the positions of the chips and the free cells.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_moves = 0
        free_position = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                total_moves += i - free_position
                free_position += 1
        
        print(total_moves)

func()
```

This corrected version keeps track of the position where the next chip should be placed (`free_position`) and calculates the total number of moves required to move each chip to its correct position.
