Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The core issue is how the product of the elements of the array `a` is calculated and outputted at each step. The program constructs a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the 'L' and 'R' commands, but it then calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order. This does not match the problem's requirement to calculate the product of the current state of `a` at each step before removing an element.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. The program constructs list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands. This is not how the problem requires the product to be calculated.
2. The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and outputs these products in reverse order. This does not match the requirement to output the product of the current state of `a` at each step.
3. The product of the elements in `a` should be recalculated after each removal of an element, considering the remaining elements in `a`.

To fix the program, we need to:
1. Calculate the product of all elements in `a` initially.
2. Output the product modulo `m` at each step.
3. Remove the appropriate element from `a` based on the command.
4. Recalculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each removal.

Given these issues, the program as provided does not meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
