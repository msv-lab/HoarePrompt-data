### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially. Specifically, if the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the (i+1)-th sign can only occur in a year `y` where `y > x` and `y` is a multiple of the period `a_{i+1}`.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs using the `func_1` function. The function iterates through each sign's periodicity and calculates the next occurrence year based on the current year.

Let's break down the key logic in `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: `current_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Processing Each Sign**:
   - For each periodicity `ai`:
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
     - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`, calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - `current_year` is updated to this next occurrence.
3. **Result Collection**: After processing all signs, `current_year` is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call, confirming that:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the number of signs and their respective periodicities.
- The `results` list contains the correct year for each test case where the n-th sign occurs.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the solution with the first example provided:

- **Input**: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing**:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- **Output**: `36`

The program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign occurs for the given example.

#### Conclusion:
The logic in the `func_1` function is correct. It properly calculates the year for each sign's occurrence based on the given periodicities and ensures that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

The original assessment is accurate, and the program correctly implements the required logic.

**Final: True**
