Let's break down the program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the final destination `n`, the number of known points `k`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - Then, it reads the list of known points `a` and the corresponding times `b`.
   - Both `a` and `b` are padded with a 0 at the beginning to simplify calculations.

2. **Calculating Distances and Speeds:**
   - `ad` is a list of distances between adjacent points in `a`.
   - `bd` is a list of time intervals between corresponding points in `b`.
   - `v` is a list of speeds between each pair of adjacent points. Speed is calculated as the ratio of distance to time.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query `d`, the program determines which segment of the journey `d` falls into using `bisect_left` on the list `a`.
   - If `d` is exactly at a known point, the corresponding time in `b` is printed.
   - If `d` is between two known points, the program calculates the exact time to reach `d` based on the speed in that segment.
   - The time is calculated as the time to reach the previous known point plus the time to travel the remaining distance at the segment's speed.
   - The result is rounded down using `int()` before printing.

### Correctness:

- **Input Handling:** The program correctly handles the input as specified in the problem statement.
- **Distance and Speed Calculation:** The distances and speeds are calculated correctly based on the given points and times.
- **Query Handling:** The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently determine which segment a query point falls into and calculates the correct time based on the speed in that segment.
- **Output:** The results are printed in the correct format and rounded down as required.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and efficiently calculates the required times for each query.

**Correctness: True**
