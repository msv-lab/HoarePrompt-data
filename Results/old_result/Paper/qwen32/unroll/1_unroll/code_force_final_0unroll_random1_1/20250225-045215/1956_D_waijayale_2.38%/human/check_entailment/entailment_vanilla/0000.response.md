Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is intended to recursively set the array segment from index `l` to `r` to the MEX value of the segment.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l] != 0`. If true, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and records this operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the segment `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` should be updated to `r - l + 1` (which is the MEX value for the segment).
   - If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets the entire segment from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records this operation.
   - It then recursively calls itself again for the segment `a[l+1:r]`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` for the entire array.
   - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - This function calculates the sum of the segment `a[l:r+1]`.
   - It checks if the sum `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` to set the segment to the MEX value and records the operation.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum value in the segment and its position.
   - It then recursively processes the segments to the left and right of the maximum value.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the results.

### Issues in the Program

- **Global Variable `a`:** The function `recursive_maximize_sum` uses a global variable `a` which is not defined within this function. This will lead to a `NameError`.
- **Global Variable `ops`:** Similarly, `recursive_maximize_sum` uses a global variable `ops` which is not defined within this function. This will also lead to a `NameError`.
- **Incorrect Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`:** The function `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly maximize the sum of the array. The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a correct condition to determine when to set the segment to the MEX value.
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation:** The function `func_1` calculates the MEX value as `r - l + 1`, which is not always the correct MEX value for the segment.
- **Inefficient Operations:** The program does not ensure that the number of operations is minimized or even within the allowed limit of \(5 \times 10^5\).

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
