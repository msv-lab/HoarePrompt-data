To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10` and `func_14`. Here is a breakdown of the process:

1. `func_10()` is called to determine the number of iterations the loop will execute. This function returns an integer value representing the number of test cases.
2. For each iteration, `func_14()` is called, which processes each test case and returns a value that is then converted to a string and printed on a new line.

Since the exact behavior of `func_10` and `func_14` is not provided, we will describe the output state in a generic manner based on the loop's structure.

Let's assume `func_10()` returns `n`, which means the loop will execute `n` times. For each iteration, `func_14()` will return some value, which we'll denote as `result_i` for the `i-th` iteration.

The output state will be `n` lines of text, each containing the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` for each test case.

Given this understanding, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **n lines of output, each line containing the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` for each test case.**
