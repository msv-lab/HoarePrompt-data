You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (0 \(\le\) \( p_i \) \(\le\) 200), representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. There are \( t \) (1 \(\le\) \( t \) \(\le\) 10^4) such test cases.

        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:

        print(cnt)
        
    #State: a list of integers, each representing the final value of `cnt` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. The final state of the program is that it outputs the calculated value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence. Alice wins if the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero. Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero. The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if for each bit position, the number of 1s is even. Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can analyze their binary representations:
- 1: `001`
- 2: `010`
- 3: `011`
- 4: `100`

The XOR of the sequence is zero if:
- The count of numbers contributing a `1` in the least significant bit (LSB) is even.
- The count of numbers contributing a `1` in the second least significant bit (2-LSB) is even.
- The count of numbers contributing a `1` in the third least significant bit (3-LSB) is even.

### Strategy for Eve:
Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins. To do this, Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers have an even count of 1s, 2s, and 3s in their binary representations, leading to a zero XOR.

### Observations:
- If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, then removing one of each will leave an even count of each, making the XOR zero.
- For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), removing pairs will always leave an even count of that number, contributing to a zero XOR.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to be implementing the above logic:
1. It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If so, it increments the count by 1 (indicating Bob can win once in the initial configuration).
2. It then adds half the count of each number type to the total count (indicating the number of pairs that can be removed, each contributing to a zero XOR).

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. **Input:** `1 1 1 0`
   - All counts are odd, so Bob wins once initially.
   - Total wins for Bob: `1 + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1`
   - **Output:** `1`
   
2. **Input:** `1 0 1 2`
   - Not all counts are odd, so Bob does not win initially.
   - Total wins for Bob: `0 + floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - **Output:** `1`
   
3. **Input:** `2 2 2 0`
   - All counts are even, so Bob does not win initially.
   - Total wins for Bob: `0 + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - **Output:** `3`
   
4. **Input:** `3 3 2 0`
   - Not all counts are odd, so Bob does not win initially.
   - Total wins for Bob: `0 + floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - **Output:** `3`
   
5. **Input:** `0 9 9 9`
   - Not all counts are odd, so Bob does not win initially.
   - Total wins for Bob: `0 + floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) = 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
   - **Output:** `12`

The program seems to be correctly implementing the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.
