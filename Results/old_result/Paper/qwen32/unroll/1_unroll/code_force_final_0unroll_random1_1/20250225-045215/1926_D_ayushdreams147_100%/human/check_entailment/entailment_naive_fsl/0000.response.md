Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The program attempts to use a bitmask XOR operation to count unique bit patterns, but it does not correctly handle the grouping requirement. The XOR operation `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` is not appropriate for this problem, as it inverts all 32 bits of the number, which doesn't align with the requirement of ensuring no two numbers in the same group have matching bit values in the least significant 31 bits.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Binary representations: 
  - 1: `000...001`
  - 2: `000...010`
  - 3: `000...011`
- These numbers can all be placed in the same group because no two numbers have matching bits in the least significant 31 bits.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `3` for this input because it incorrectly treats each number as needing its own group due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
