The provided code snippet calls a recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the given initial state. Instead, it likely modifies some internal state or variables within the function itself, which are not part of the initial state provided.

Since the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined in the provided context, we can only infer that it will perform some operation based on the subarray `a[l:pos]`. However, the impact of this function on the external variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, and `pos` is not specified, and we are only concerned with the variables provided in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the function call not affecting the listed variables.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, where n is the length of the array `a`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive. The sum `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. Additionally, `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
