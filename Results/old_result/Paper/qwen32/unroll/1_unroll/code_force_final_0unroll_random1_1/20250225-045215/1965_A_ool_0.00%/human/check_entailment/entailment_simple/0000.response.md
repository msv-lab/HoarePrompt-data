Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the problem description and the annotated states. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then reads the subsequent lines, but it incorrectly parses the input. The variable `n` is assigned the first line of each test case (which should be the number of piles), and `arr` is assigned the second line (which should be the list of stones in each pile). However, the function `func_1` is called with `arr`, which includes both `n` and the list of stones. This is incorrect because `func_1` should only receive the list of stones.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` contains logic that does not align with the game rules or the provided examples. Specifically:
   - The function checks if the first element of `arr` (which is `n`, the number of piles) is not equal to 1. If it's not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This logic is incorrect because the number of piles does not determine the winner directly.
   - The function then creates a set from `arr` and checks for consecutive elements with a difference greater than 1. This logic is also incorrect because the game is not about the consecutive differences between the number of stones in the piles; it's about the parity of the number of piles that have an odd number of stones.

3. **Game Theory**: The correct approach to solve this problem is to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. If the Nim-sum of the number of stones in all piles is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If it is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
