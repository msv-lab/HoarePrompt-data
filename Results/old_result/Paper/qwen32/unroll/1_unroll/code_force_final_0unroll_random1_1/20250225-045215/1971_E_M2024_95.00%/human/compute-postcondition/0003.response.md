Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, a list `a` of `k` integers, a list `b` of `k` integers, and `q` queries each consisting of an integer `d`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each query based on the given constraints. Specifically, for each query `d`, the function determines a value based on the lists `a` and `b`, and returns this value.**
