The provided code snippet only initializes a variable `one` to `True`. The other variables (`lst`, `rev`, `z`, and `tmp`) are not modified by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `lst`, `rev`, `z`, and `tmp`. The only change is the introduction of the variable `one` with the value `True`.

Output State: **`lst` and `rev` are defaultdicts where `lst[a]` contains all `b` such that a pair (a, b) was read, and `rev[b]` contains all `a` such that a pair (a, b) was read; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is assigned the value of `z`; `one` is `True`**.
