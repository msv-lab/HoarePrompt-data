### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the function summaries to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to handle the MEX operation on a subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - **Logic**:
     - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to `0` and records the operation.
     - It then recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
     - After the recursive call, if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets the entire subarray from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - **Issues**:
     - The logic for setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` is not aligned with the MEX operation. The MEX operation should find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray and set all elements to this value.
     - The function does not correctly compute the MEX value, leading to incorrect operations and potentially suboptimal results.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the array.
   - **Logic**:
     - It initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations list.
   - **Issues**:
     - `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within `func_2` or imported, leading to a `NameError`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to maximize the sum of the array by recursively processing subarrays.
   - **Logic**:
     - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
     - It checks if `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` and calls `func_1` if true.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum value.
   - **Issues**:
     - The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` does not guarantee that setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` is optimal.
     - The function does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the sum is maximized.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the results.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads `n` and the array `a`.
     - It calls `func_2` to get the sum, number of operations, and operations list.
     - It prints the sum and operations in the required format.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function relies on `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, which are incorrect as discussed above.

### Issues Identified:
- **Undefined Function**: `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within `func_2`.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed, particularly in how the MEX operation is handled and how the sum is maximized.
- **Inefficient Operations**: The program does not guarantee that the number of operations will be within the allowed limit of `5 \cdot 10^5`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect due to undefined functions, flawed logic, and potential inefficiency in the number of operations.

**Final: False**
