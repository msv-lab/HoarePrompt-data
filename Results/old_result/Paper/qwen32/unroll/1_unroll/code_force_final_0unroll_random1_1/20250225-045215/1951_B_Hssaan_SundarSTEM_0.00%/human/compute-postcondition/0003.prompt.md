You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. a is a list of n distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans = 0

        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        
        print(max(ans, ans1))
        
    #State: A series of integers, each representing the maximum number of consecutive elements less than or equal to the element at the k-th position after specified swaps for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. The function returns a value (not further specified in the output description) for each test case based on the provided inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
