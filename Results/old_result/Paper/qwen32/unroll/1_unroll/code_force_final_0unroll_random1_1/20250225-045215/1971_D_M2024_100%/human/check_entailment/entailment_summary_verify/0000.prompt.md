You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' plus one if there are no '0' to '1' transitions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's).
- A cut is needed whenever the sequence switches from '1' to '0' or from '0' to '1'.
- The number of pieces required will be one more than the number of such switches.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' and from '0' to '1'. It then calculates the number of pieces required based on these transitions.

Here is the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
```

### Logic:
- The program correctly counts the transitions between '1' and '0'.
- The number of pieces required is the number of these transitions plus one.
- The logic seems correct as it handles both transitions and calculates the number of pieces accordingly.

### Testing with Example Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:

1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions: `1 -> 0`, `0 -> 1`, `1 -> 0` (3 transitions)
   - Pieces required: `3 + 1 = 4` (However, the correct answer is `3` because the first and last transitions can be combined into one piece)
   - **Issue:** This indicates that the logic might be flawed because it counts each transition separately without considering that consecutive transitions can be part of a single piece.

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - No transitions
   - Pieces required: `1`
   - **Correct**

3. **Input:** `1`
   - No transitions
   - Pieces required: `1`
   - **Correct**

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transitions: `1 -> 0`
   - Pieces required: `1 + 1 = 2`
   - **Correct**

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - No transitions
   - Pieces required: `1`
   - **Correct**

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transitions: `0 -> 1`, `1 -> 0`
   - Pieces required: `2`
   - **Correct**

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle cases where consecutive transitions can be combined into a single piece. For example, in the input `11010`, the correct answer should be `3`, but the program outputs `4`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of the Issue:
The program counts each transition separately, which leads to an incorrect count of pieces when consecutive transitions can be combined into a single piece. For instance, in the string `11010`, the transitions `1 -> 0` and `0 -> 1` can be part of the same piece, reducing the total number of pieces required.
