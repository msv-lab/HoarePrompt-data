Functionality: **The function constructs and returns a list of integers based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list starting with powers of 2 up to a certain limit, includes specific calculated values related to `k`, and returns the length of the list followed by its elements separated by spaces.**
