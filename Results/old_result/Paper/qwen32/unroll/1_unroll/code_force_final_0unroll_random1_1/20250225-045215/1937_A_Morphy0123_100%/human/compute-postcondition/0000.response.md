The variable `n_cases` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other conditions and variables from the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), representing the length of the array a. `n_cases` is assigned the value of the integer input.**
