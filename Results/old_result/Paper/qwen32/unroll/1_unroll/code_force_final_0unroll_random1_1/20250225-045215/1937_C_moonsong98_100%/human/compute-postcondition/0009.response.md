To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the for loop:
```
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable that starts at 0 and increments by 1 up to, but not including, `n`.

The state before the loop starts is:
- `max_index` is `n-1`
- `min_indices` is `[n-1]`

Since `max_index` and `min_indices` are not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust them for the loop to execute. However, to ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` before the loop starts is not relevant since it is initialized by the loop itself.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is `[n-1]`, `n` must be greater than 0**
