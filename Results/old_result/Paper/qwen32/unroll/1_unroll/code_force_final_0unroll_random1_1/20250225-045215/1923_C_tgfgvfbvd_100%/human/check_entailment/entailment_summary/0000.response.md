### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a subarray can be transformed into another array (`b`) such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
2. Each element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

The approach used in the program involves:
- Calculating prefix sums (`p`) which help in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.
- Calculating a prefix count (`c`) of the number of 1's up to each index, which helps in determining how many elements are 1 in any subarray.

For each query, the program checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` by:
- Ensuring that the subarray has more than one element (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
- Checking if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the subarray (`s - (b - a + 1) >= i`).

This condition ensures that:
- There are enough non-1 elements to adjust the values such that the sum remains the same and each element is different from the original (since each element can be decremented by at least 1 if it's not 1, and the sum of the decrements should be equal to the number of 1's in the subarray).

### Correctness:

The logic in the program correctly checks the conditions specified in the problem for determining if a subarray is "good". The use of prefix sums and prefix counts allows the program to efficiently handle the constraints provided.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

**Correctness: True**
