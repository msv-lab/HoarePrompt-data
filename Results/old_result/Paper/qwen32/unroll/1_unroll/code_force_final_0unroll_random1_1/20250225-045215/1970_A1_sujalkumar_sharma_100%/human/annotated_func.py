#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.

    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))

            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples (balance, i, s[i]) for each index i from 0 to n-1; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` which is a permutation of the original string `s` based on the sorting criteria of `prefix_balance`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string that is a permutation of `s`, sorted based on the balance of parentheses and their positions.
