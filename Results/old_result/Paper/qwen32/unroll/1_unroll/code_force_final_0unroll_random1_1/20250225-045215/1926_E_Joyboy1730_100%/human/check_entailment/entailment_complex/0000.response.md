Let's analyze the given code in the context of the problem description to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order based on multiples of odd numbers. The task is to determine the k-th card in this sequence for given values of n and k.

### Code Analysis
The code processes each test case as follows:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are read.
   - `L` is initialized as an empty list to store the counts of cards in each group (based on multiples of odd numbers).
   - `tot` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total number of cards processed so far.
   - `pow` is initialized to 1 to represent the current multiplier (starting with 1, then 2, 4, etc.).

2. **Building the List `L`**:
   - The while loop runs until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards left.
   - `n` is decremented by `m` to account for the odd-numbered cards.
   - `m` is appended to `L`, representing the count of cards in the current group.

3. **Determining the k-th Card**:
   - The for loop iterates over the counts in `L` (representing the groups of cards).
   - For each group, it checks if `k` lies within the range of cards in the current group.
   - If `k` is within the range, it calculates the k-th card in the current group using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - `tot` is updated to include the count of cards in the current group.
   - `pow` is doubled to move to the next group of cards (multiples of the next power of 2).

### Verification
The code correctly calculates the k-th card based on the described process. It efficiently determines the group and position of the k-th card by leveraging the properties of odd numbers and their multiples.

### Conclusion
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
