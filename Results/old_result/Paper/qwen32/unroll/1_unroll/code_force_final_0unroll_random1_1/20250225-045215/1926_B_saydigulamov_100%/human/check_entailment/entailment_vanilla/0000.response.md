Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Triangle Definition**:
   - A triangle consists of `k` consecutive rows where the `i-th` row has `2*i-1` consecutive `1`s.
   - The `1`s are centered in one column.
   - An upside-down triangle is also valid.

2. **Square Definition**:
   - A square consists of `k` consecutive rows where each row has `k` consecutive `1`s.
   - The `1`s are aligned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

3. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases (up to 100).
   - For each test case, a grid size `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).
   - The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output "SQUARE" if the grid contains a square, otherwise "TRIANGLE".

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to determine the shape based on the count of `1`s in each row that contains at least one `1`.

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `a` is read.
   - For each test case, the grid size `n` is read.
   - The grid is read line by line, and for each line containing at least one `1`, the count of `1`s is stored in the list `k`.

2. **Determining Shape**:
   - The program checks if the count of `1`s in the first two rows (`k[0] == k[1]`) to determine the shape.
   - If `k[0] == k[1]`, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Flaws in the Program

The logic used in the program to determine the shape is incorrect:

- **Square Check**:
  - A square requires all rows with `1`s to have the same number of `1`s, not just the first two rows.
  - The program only checks the first two rows, which is insufficient.

- **Triangle Check**:
  - A triangle requires the number of `1`s in each row to follow the pattern `2*i-1` for `i` from 1 to `k`.
  - The program does not check this pattern at all.
  - It simply checks if the count of `1`s in the first two rows is different, which is not a reliable indicator of a triangle.

### Example Counter-Case

Consider a 4x4 grid with the following configuration:

```
0000
0110
1111
0110
```

- The counts of `1`s in rows containing `1`s are `[2, 4, 2]`.
- The program would incorrectly determine this as a "TRIANGLE" because `k[0] != k[1]`.
- However, this is neither a valid triangle nor a square.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the given definitions.

**Correctness: False**
