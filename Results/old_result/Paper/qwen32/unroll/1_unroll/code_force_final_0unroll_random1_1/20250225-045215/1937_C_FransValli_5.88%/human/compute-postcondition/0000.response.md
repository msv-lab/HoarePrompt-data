In the given task, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a conventional variable name used when the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. Therefore, adjusting the state of `_` does not affect the execution of the loop. The loop will execute as long as the number of iterations, specified by `int(input())`, is greater than 0.

Given that the loop iterates over the number of test cases, the state that we need to adjust is the input itself, which determines the number of iterations. Since the problem states that there are multiple test cases and each test case has a permutation of length `n` (with `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4`), we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the input is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state adjustment, we do not need to specify any state for it.
