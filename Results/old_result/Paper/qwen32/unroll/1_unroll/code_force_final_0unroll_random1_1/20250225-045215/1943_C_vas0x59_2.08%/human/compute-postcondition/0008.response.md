Output State: **The graph represented by the list of lists remains unchanged; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by `bfs(a)`; `a` is a list of distances where each distance is twice the corresponding distance in the original `d`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices for path reconstruction; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing a single element `b`.**

In simple terms, the graph, distances `d`, modified distances `a`, the list of previous vertices, and the result `b` from `func_1(d)` remain unchanged. A new list `path_ba` is created containing only the element `b`.
