### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem description, which requires counting the number of permutations based on given prefix and suffix maximums.

The problem description clearly outlines a need for a more complex algorithm involving combinatorial mathematics or dynamic programming to determine the number of valid permutations. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be related to modular arithmetic, specifically finding modular inverses, which are not directly relevant to solving the problem as described.

Here's a breakdown of the original assessment:
1. **Parsing Input**: The problem requires parsing multiple test cases with details about the length of the permutation and the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums.
2. **Counting Permutations**: The core task is to count permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. This involves complex combinatorial or dynamic programming techniques.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The final result should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided functions do not implement any of these steps and instead seem to be focused on modular arithmetic, which is not directly applicable to solving the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not solve the problem as described. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
