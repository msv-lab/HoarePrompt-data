Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program against the problem description and identify any issues.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the case when `l == r` and when `a[l] != 0`, setting `a[l]` to `0` and adding the operation to `ops`.
   - It also recursively calls itself to handle the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
   - After the recursive call, if the value at `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets the entire subarray from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and adds the operation to `ops`.
   - The function seems to be trying to maximize the MEX value of the subarray, but it does so in a way that might not be optimal for the overall sum of the array.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within this function. It seems like it should be defined within this function or passed as an argument.
   - The function returns the sum of the array `a`, the length of the operations list `ops`, and the operations list `ops` itself.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function calculates the sum `s` of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - It checks if `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, and if so, it calls `func_1` and sets the entire subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value `mx` in the subarray and its position `pos`. It then recursively calls itself on the subarrays to the left and right of `pos`.
   - The function seems to be trying to partition the array around the maximum value and maximize the sum in each partition.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` with the array `a`, and prints the sum and the operations.
   - It correctly formats the output by adding 1 to `l` and `r` to convert from 0-based to 1-based indexing.

### Issues Identified:
- **Undefined Function**: `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within `func_2`.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` seems flawed. The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` does not necessarily imply that setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` is optimal.
- **Inefficient Operations**: The program does not guarantee that the number of operations will be within the allowed limit of `5 \cdot 10^5`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to undefined functions, flawed logic, and potential inefficiency in the number of operations.

Correctness: **False**
