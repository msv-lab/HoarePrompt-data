You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of t test cases. Each test case is a tuple (n, a), where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers representing the periodicities of the signs, with each integer a_i satisfying 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        
        results.append(current_year)
        
    #State: `results` is a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the first common year when all signs change for the corresponding test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the first common year when all signs change for the corresponding test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of `t` test cases. Each test case is a tuple `(n, a)`, where `n` is the number of signs and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the first common year when all signs change for the corresponding test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the first common year when all signs change for the corresponding test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
