The given code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer. This lambda function is not executed in the snippet; it is simply defined. Therefore, there are no changes to the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices Bessie has chosen.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer.**
