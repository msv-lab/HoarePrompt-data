Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed). The function returns 'Ron' in Case_1 and 'Hermione' in Case_2.**
