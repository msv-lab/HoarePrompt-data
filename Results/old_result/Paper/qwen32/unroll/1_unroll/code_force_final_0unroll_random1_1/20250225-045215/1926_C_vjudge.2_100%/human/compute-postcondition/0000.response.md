The code snippet assigns the value of `int(2 * 100000.0) + 1` to the variable `N`. Since `2 * 100000.0` is `200000.0`, converting it to an integer with `int()` does not change its value, and adding `1` results in `200001`. The variable `N` is now equal to `200001`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, N is 200001**.
