Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Understanding

The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The game is played multiple times as Eve removes one number from the sequence each time. Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins.

### Key Observations

1. **Bitwise XOR**:
   - XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
   - For the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, their binary representations are:
     - 1: 001
     - 2: 010
     - 3: 011
     - 4: 100

2. **Bob's Wins**:
   - Bob wins when the XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - If initially, the XOR of the sequence is zero, Bob wins the first round.
   - Eve can strategically remove numbers to ensure that the XOR remains zero for subsequent rounds.

3. **Count of Numbers**:
   - If the count of any number (1, 2, 3, or 4) in the sequence is odd, it affects the XOR result.
   - Specifically, for the XOR to be zero, the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position must be even.

### Strategy for Eve

- **Initial XOR Check**:
  - Compute the XOR of the initial sequence.
  - If the XOR is zero, Bob wins the first round.
- **Removing Numbers**:
  - If the count of any number (1, 2, 3, or 4) is odd, Eve can remove it to make the count even.
  - If all counts are even, Eve can remove any number without affecting the parity of the counts.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- **Input Parsing**:
  - The input consists of the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` attempts to make all counts even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. This step is incorrect as it does not correctly handle the parity of the counts.

- **Odd Count Check**:
  - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` checks if the first three counts (1, 2, 3) have an odd count. This is not a correct way to determine if the XOR of the sequence is zero.
  
- **Bob's Wins Calculation**:
  - `sum(p) // 2` calculates the total number of numbers divided by 2, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Correct Approach

To correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to:

1. Count the number of each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4).
2. Determine the initial XOR of the sequence.
3. If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins the first round.
4. Eve can remove numbers to ensure that the XOR remains zero for subsequent rounds by:
   - Removing numbers with odd counts to make them even.
   - Removing any number if all counts are already even.

The correct logic should be:
- If the XOR of the initial sequence is zero, Bob wins the first round.
- Eve can ensure that Bob wins every second round by maintaining the parity of the counts.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the XOR of the initial sequence
        xor_initial = (p[0] % 2) ^ (p[1] % 2) ^ (p[2] % 2) ^ (p[3] % 2)
        # Total number of numbers
        total_numbers = sum(p)
        # Bob wins if the initial XOR is zero
        bob_wins = 1 if xor_initial == 0 else 0
        # Eve can ensure Bob wins every second round
        bob_wins += total_numbers // 2
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The program incorrectly handles the parity of counts and does not correctly compute the XOR of the sequence.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
