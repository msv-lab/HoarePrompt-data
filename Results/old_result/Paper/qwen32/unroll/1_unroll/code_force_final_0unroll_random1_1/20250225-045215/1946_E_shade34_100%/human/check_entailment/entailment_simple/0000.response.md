### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of counting permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The key steps and logic in the program are as follows:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to 200,000 modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for combinatorial calculations later in the program.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m_1\), and \(m_2\), followed by two lines of indices representing prefix and suffix maximums.

3. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions are not met, the program outputs 0, indicating no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.
   - It calculates combinations using the precomputed factorials and a function `func_2` that computes modular inverses using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (implemented in `func_1`).
   - The program multiplies the combinations for the suffix maximums, the prefix maximums, and the gaps between consecutive maximums.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis:

- The logic for checking the prefix and suffix maximum conditions is correct.
- The combinatorial calculations are based on the properties of permutations and maximums, and the use of factorials and modular inverses is appropriate for counting permutations.
- The provided example outputs match the expected results, suggesting that the program is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented and solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
