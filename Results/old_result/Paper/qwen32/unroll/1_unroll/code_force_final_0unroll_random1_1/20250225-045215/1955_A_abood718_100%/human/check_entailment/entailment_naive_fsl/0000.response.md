Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif A % 2 == 0` is not sufficient to cover all scenarios where the minimum cost calculation should be based on the promotion price.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 3 5 10`
- Expected Output: `15` (because buying two yogurts at the promotion price for 10 burles and one yogurt at the regular price for 5 burles results in a total of 15 burles)
- Actual Output: `10` (the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 10 burles, which is not the minimum cost for this case)

The issue arises because the program does not correctly handle cases where the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price is still cheaper than buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price. The correct approach should be to always calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and handle the remaining yogurt separately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = A // 2
        remaining = A % 2
        if C < 2 * B:
            print(pairs * C + remaining * B)
        else:
            print(A * B)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum cost is always calculated correctly for both even and odd numbers of yogurts.
