You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [num - 1 for num in a]
        ans = x - 2
        st = set(a)
        a.sort()
        for i in range(x):
            t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
            t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
            if t1 not in st and t2 in st:

            elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
                even.append(gap)
        odd.sort()
        even.sort()
        for gap in odd:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        for gap in even:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` that is determined by the gaps between the integers in the list and the value of `y`. The function does not modify the input values but uses them to compute and output a result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to have some logical issues that could lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

Let's break down the logic and see if there are any potential issues:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   ```python
   ans = x - 2
   ```
   This assumes that the initial number of triangles is `x - 2`, which is correct if all `x` vertices form a single continuous polygonal chain. However, this is not always the case. The vertices could be scattered in such a way that they do not form a single continuous chain, and thus the initial number of triangles would not be `x - 2`.

2. **Handling of gaps**:
   The program calculates gaps between consecutive vertices and then tries to add triangles by filling these gaps. However, the logic for handling gaps seems flawed:
   - For odd gaps, it adds `gap` to `ans` and subtracts `gap // 2` from `y`.
   - For even gaps, it does the same.

   This logic does not correctly account for the fact that adding a triangle in a gap may not necessarily use up `gap // 2` vertices. It also does not consider the possibility of forming multiple triangles within a single gap.

3. **Edge cases**:
   - **Small values of `y`**: The program does not handle the case where `y` is very small or zero correctly. For example, if `y` is zero, the program should not attempt to add any triangles.
   - **Scattered vertices**: If the vertices are scattered such that they do not form a single continuous chain, the initial calculation of `ans` as `x - 2` is incorrect.
   - **Large gaps**: The program does not handle large gaps correctly. For example, if there is a large gap between two vertices, the program may not be able to form the maximum number of triangles.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
10 4 2
1 3 7 9
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Explanation:
- The vertices 1, 3, 7, and 9 form a polygon with gaps of 2 between each pair.
- With `y = 2`, we can add 2 more vertices to form 4 triangles.

However, the provided program may not handle this case correctly and could output an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
