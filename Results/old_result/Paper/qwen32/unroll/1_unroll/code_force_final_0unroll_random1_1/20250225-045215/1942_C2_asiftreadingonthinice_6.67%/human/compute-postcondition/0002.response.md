To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the variables. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - For each test case (`tt` times), the code reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads a list `a` of `x` distinct integers representing chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting and Initial Answer Calculation**:
   - The list `a` is sorted.
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`.

3. **Processing Differences Between Consecutive Vertices**:
   - The code iterates through the sorted list `a` and checks the difference between consecutive vertices.
   - If the difference is exactly 2, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - If the difference is even and `y` is sufficient, it adds half the difference to `ans` and adjusts `y`.

4. **Checking the Circular Difference**:
   - The code checks the difference between the first and last vertices considering the circular nature of the vertices (i.e., `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]`).
   - Similar to the previous step, it adjusts `ans` and `y` if the difference is even and `y` is sufficient.

5. **Adding Remaining `y`**:
   - After processing all differences, the remaining `y` is added to `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The final answer `ans` is compared with `n - 2`, and the smaller value is printed.

Given the initial state and the loop, the output state will be the final results of all test cases printed one by one. Since the loop processes each test case independently, the final output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

Output State: **The final results of all test cases printed one by one.**
