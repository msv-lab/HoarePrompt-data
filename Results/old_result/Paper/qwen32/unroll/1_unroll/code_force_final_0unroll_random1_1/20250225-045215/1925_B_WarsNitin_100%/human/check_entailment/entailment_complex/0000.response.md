### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of `n` sub-problems such that their sum equals `x`. The provided program attempts to solve this by iterating through potential divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used as the balance.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Iterating Through Divisors**: The program iterates through potential divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`. This is efficient because if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then `x // i` is also a divisor.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. If so, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and `i`.
   - Similarly, it checks the same conditions for the divisor `x // i` and updates the answer accordingly.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the maximum balance found.

### Correctness Analysis:

The key point of the program is to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`. This ensures that we can split `x` into `n` sub-problems, each with difficulty `d`, and possibly some additional sub-problems with smaller difficulties, but the GCD of all sub-problems will be `d`.

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case (x = 10, n = 3)**:
   - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - Checking:
     - For `i = 1`: `10 - 3 * 1 = 7` (not divisible by 1)
     - For `i = 2`: `10 - 3 * 2 = 4` (divisible by 2)
     - For `i = 5`: `10 - 3 * 5 = -5` (negative)
     - For `i = 10`: `10 - 3 * 10 = -20` (negative)
   - The largest valid `d` is 2.

2. **Second Test Case (x = 5, n = 5)**:
   - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
   - Checking:
     - For `i = 1`: `5 - 5 * 1 = 0` (divisible by 1)
     - For `i = 5`: `5 - 5 * 5 = -20` (negative)
   - The largest valid `d` is 1.

3. **Third Test Case (x = 420, n = 69)**:
   - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
   - Checking:
     - For `i = 6`: `420 - 69 * 6 = 6` (divisible by 6)
     - For `i = 35`: `420 - 69 * 35 = -2115` (negative)
     - For `i = 60`: `420 - 69 * 60 = -3960` (negative)
     - For `i = 70`: `420 - 69 * 70 = -4410` (negative)
     - For `i = 84`: `420 - 69 * 84 = -5196` (negative)
     - For `i = 105`: `420 - 69 * 105 = -6435` (negative)
     - For `i = 140`: `420 - 69 * 140 = -8700` (negative)
     - For `i = 210`: `420 - 69 * 210 = -12990` (negative)
     - For `i = 420`: `420 - 69 * 420 = -28980` (negative)
   - The largest valid `d` is 6.

The program correctly identifies the maximum balance for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
