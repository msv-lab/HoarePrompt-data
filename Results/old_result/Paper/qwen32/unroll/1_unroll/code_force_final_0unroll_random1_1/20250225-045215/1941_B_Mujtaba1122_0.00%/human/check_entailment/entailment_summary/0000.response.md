Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine whether it is possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation allows choosing an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`) and then modifying the elements at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by subtracting `1`, `2`, and `1` respectively.

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to apply the operation described in the problem to the list. It iterates through the list from the second element to the second-to-last element and applies the operation as long as the conditions (`list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0`) are met. After attempting to apply the operation, it calls `func_1` to check if the list is now all zeros and prints "YES" if it is, otherwise "NO".

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_2`. The operation inside the while loop is incorrectly implemented. The lines:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```
are not performing the operation as described in the problem. They should be:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```
The current implementation would reduce `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` to zero if they are greater than zero, which is not the correct behavior.

Given this issue, the program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operation.

Correctness: **False**
