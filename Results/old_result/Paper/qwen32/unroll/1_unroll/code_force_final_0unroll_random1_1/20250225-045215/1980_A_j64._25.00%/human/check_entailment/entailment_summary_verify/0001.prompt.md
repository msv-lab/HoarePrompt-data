You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Function Summary: 
The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (number of problems), an integer `m` (number of upcoming rounds), and a string `a` (problem difficulties). The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of additional problems needed for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold `m` rounds, where each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

### Program Explanation

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program takes `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it has `n` problems, `m` rounds, and a string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - For each test case, a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (representing the 7 difficulty levels 'A' to 'G') is initialized to zero.
   - The program then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` based on the difficulty level of each problem. This is done using `ord(prob) - ord('A')` to map 'A' to index 0, 'B' to index 1, and so on up to 'G' at index 6.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems:**
   - For each difficulty level, the program calculates how many more problems are needed by subtracting the current frequency from `m` and taking the maximum of this difference and zero. This is done using `max(0, m - f)`.
   - The sum of these differences gives the total number of additional problems needed for that test case.

4. **Output:**
   - The program returns a list of results, one for each test case, representing the minimum number of additional problems required.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequencies: `B=2`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=1`, `D=2`
  - Missing: `A=1`, `F=1`
  - Total missing: `2`
  
- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequencies: `B=2`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=1`, `D=2`
  - Missing: `A=2`, `F=2`, `C=1`
  - Total missing: `5`
  
- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
  - Frequencies: `B=2`, `C=1`, `D=1`, `E=1`, `F=2`, `G=2`
  - Missing: `A=1`
  - Total missing: `1`

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems required for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
