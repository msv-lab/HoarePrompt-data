Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The program attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with characters from `unique_chars` in reverse order. However, it does so by modifying the string `s` in place within a loop, which is not the correct approach. The replacement should be done based on a mapping from each character in `s` to its corresponding symmetric character in `unique_chars`, but the current code does not establish such a mapping.

2. **Incorrect Use of `replace`**: The `replace` function is used incorrectly. It replaces all occurrences of a character in the string, which is not what is needed. The task requires each character in the encoded string to be replaced by its symmetric counterpart from the unique characters list, but this is not correctly handled.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The program tries to insert characters into `unique_chars` and adjust indices, but this logic is flawed. The unique characters list should be constructed once and then used to map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart.

4. **Incorrect Return Value**: The function returns the concatenation of `unique_chars`, which is not the decoded string. The decoded string should be constructed by mapping each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly decode the encoded string as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
