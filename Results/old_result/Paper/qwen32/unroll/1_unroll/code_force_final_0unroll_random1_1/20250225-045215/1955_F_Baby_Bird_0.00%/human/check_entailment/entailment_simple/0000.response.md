To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic it employs and compare it to the problem's requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally from a sequence of integers. Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if for every bit position, the number of 1s in that position is even. The numbers in the sequence are restricted to being 1, 2, 3, or 4, which have the following binary representations:
- 1: 001
- 2: 010
- 3: 011
- 4: 100

Given the counts of these numbers, we need to figure out how to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

### Key Observations
1. The XOR of an even number of 1s is 0.
2. The XOR of an even number of 2s is 0.
3. The XOR of an even number of 3s is 0.
4. The XOR of an even number of 4s is 0.
5. If the XOR of all numbers is zero, Bob wins.

### Strategy
Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as many times as possible. This means Eve should try to maintain an even count of numbers that contribute to each bit position being zero.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code

The provided code attempts to solve the problem as follows:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

Let's break down the code:
1. `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This line reads the input and converts each count to the nearest even number. This step is incorrect because it doesn't consider the actual contribution of each number type to the XOR.
2. `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`: This checks if the first three counts (for 1s, 2s, and 3s) are all odd. If they are, it adds 1 to the result. This is a heuristic that doesn't align with the problem's requirements.
3. `sum(p) // 2`: This sums the adjusted counts and divides by 2. This step is also incorrect because it doesn't consider the actual XOR properties.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. It uses heuristics that do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
