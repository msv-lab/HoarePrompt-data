The function `func_1` takes four parameters: an integer `n`, a positive integer `m`, a list `a` of integers of length `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m`, and returns this cumulative product list in reverse order.
