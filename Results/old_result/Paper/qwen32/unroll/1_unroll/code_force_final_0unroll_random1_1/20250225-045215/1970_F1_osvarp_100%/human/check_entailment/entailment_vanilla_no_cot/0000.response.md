Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Global Variables and Scope Issues**:
   - The `goal` and `points` variables are defined inside `func_1`, but they are used in `goalIn` without being passed as arguments or declared as global. This will lead to an `UnboundLocalError`.

2. **Incorrect Movement Handling**:
   - The movement of entities is not correctly handled. The `mov` dictionary is not defined anywhere in the code, which will cause a `NameError` when trying to access `mov[com]`.

3. **Incorrect Goal Checking**:
   - The `goalIn` function is used to determine if a position is a goal, but it assumes that `goal` is a global variable, which it is not.

4. **Incorrect Player Check**:
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies players, but it is not used consistently in the code.

5. **Incorrect Logic for Quaffle Handling**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the logic for catching and throwing the Quaffle. For example, when a player catches the Quaffle, the code should update the position of the Quaffle to match the player's position, but this is not done.

6. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the scoring logic. It should check if the Quaffle is thrown into the correct goal and update the score accordingly. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

7. **Incorrect Output Format**:
   - The output format for goals is incorrect. The code should print `t RED GOAL` or `t BLUE GOAL` based on the team that scored, but it incorrectly uses `GoalName[team]`, which is not defined.

8. **Incorrect Handling of Quaffle Reset**:
   - When a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field, but the code does not do this.

9. **Incorrect Handling of Player Actions**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the actions of players, such as moving, catching, and throwing the Quaffle.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and will not produce the expected output for the given problem description.
