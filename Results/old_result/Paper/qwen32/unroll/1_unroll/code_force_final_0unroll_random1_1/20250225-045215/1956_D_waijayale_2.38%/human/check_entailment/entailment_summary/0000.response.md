Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior to determine if the program meets the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
   - This function is supposed to modify the subarray `a[l:r+1]` and record the operations in `ops`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0 and sets it to 0 if true, recording the operation.
   - If `l != r`, it recursively calls itself with `l+1` and `r`. After the recursive call, it checks if the first element `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray `r-l+1`. If not, it sets all elements in `a[l:r+1]` to `r-l+1` and records the operation.
   - The function modifies `a` in place and appends operations to `ops`.

2. **Function `func_2(a)`**:
   - This function initializes an empty list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n-1)`.
   - It returns a tuple containing the sum of all elements in `a`, the length of `ops`, and `ops`.
   - However, the code does not actually pass `a` or `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum`, which means `recursive_maximize_sum` cannot modify `a` or append to `ops` as intended.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
   - This function is supposed to recursively modify the subarray `a[l:r+1]` based on the sum of its elements.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r-l+1` and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays on either side of the maximum element.
   - The function modifies `a` in place and appends operations to `ops`.
   - However, `a` and `ops` are not passed as arguments, so the changes are not reflected outside this function.

4. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2(a)`, and prints the sum and the number of operations.
   - The operations are printed in the required format.
   - However, due to the issues in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, the operations and the modifications to `a` are not correctly recorded or applied.

### Issues:
- The main issue is that `a` and `ops` are not properly passed to `recursive_maximize_sum` in `func_2`, which means the operations and modifications are not correctly recorded or applied.
- The recursive logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` is correct, but the lack of proper parameter passing means that the function does not modify `a` or record operations as intended.
- The output of `func_2` is incorrect because `ops` is not being populated correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with parameter passing and the lack of proper modification and operation recording, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
