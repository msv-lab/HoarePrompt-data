### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its issues based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Main Issues Identified:
1. **Percentage Calculation**: The program calculates percentages instead of directly checking the counts of zeros and ones relative to the required thresholds (ceiling of half the houses on each side). This is incorrect.
2. **Ceiling Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the ceiling of half the number of houses. Instead of using the ceiling function, it uses integer division and percentage calculations, which can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house. It should check if the entire village can be on one side.
4. **Optimal Position Calculation**: The program uses a list to store valid positions and then finds the minimum difference, which is inefficient and can be optimized.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Percentage Calculation**:
  - The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using integer division and percentage, which is incorrect. Instead, it should compare the counts directly with the ceiling of half the number of houses on each side.
  
- **Ceiling Calculation**:
  - The program should use the ceiling function to determine the required number of zeros and ones on each side. For example, if there are `i` houses on the left, the number of zeros should be at least `math.ceil(i / 2)`.
  
- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The program should check if the entire village can be on one side. If the total number of zeros is at least `math.ceil(n / 2)`, the road should be laid before the first house (`i = 0`). Similarly, if the total number of ones is at least `math.ceil(n / 2)`, the road should be laid after the last house (`i = n`).
  
- **Optimal Position Calculation**:
  - The program should efficiently find the optimal position by iterating through the houses and checking the conditions directly without storing all valid positions.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        min_diff = float('inf')
        best_i = None
        
        # Check if the entire village can be on one side
        if z >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            best_i = 0
        elif o >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            best_i = n
        
        # Iterate through the houses to find the optimal position
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and o - one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                diff = abs(n / 2 - (i + 1))
                if diff < min_diff:
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_i = i + 1
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic specified in the problem description due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected version of the program addresses these issues and correctly finds the optimal position to split the houses.

Final: **False**
