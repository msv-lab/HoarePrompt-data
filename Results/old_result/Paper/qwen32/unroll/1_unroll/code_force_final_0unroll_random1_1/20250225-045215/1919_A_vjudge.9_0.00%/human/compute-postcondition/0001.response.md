The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `t`, as they are not modified by the code. The only change is the introduction of the `results` list.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `results` is an empty list.**
