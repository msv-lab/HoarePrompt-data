The for loop in the provided code depends on the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer read from the input. The variables `p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted directly to ensure the loop executes. We need to ensure that the input provided to the program will result in a positive integer `t` so that the loop can execute at least once.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains `_` and `int(input())`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer read from the input.
2. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. The variables `p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the number of iterations of the loop. They are mentioned in the problem statement to provide context about the data that will be processed inside the loop, but they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the input to the program results in `t` being greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
