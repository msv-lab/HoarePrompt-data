Output State: **The program returns the tuple (x + dx, y + dy)**

In this case, the program returns a tuple where the first element is the sum of `x` and `dx`, and the second element is the sum of `y` and `dy`. The specific values of `x`, `dx`, `y`, and `dy` are not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
