Postcondition: **`sa` is a list of nodes that have 'F' characters but no 'S' characters; `sb` is a list of nodes that have 'S' characters but no 'F' characters; `a` and `b` lists remain as they were initially with counts of 'F' and 'S' respectively; `xx` remains unchanged; the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`**
