The code provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is a list of lists representing the vertices connected to each vertex index.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index in the outer list. `n` is an input integer.**
