You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it finds the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, and prints this divisor.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
- The goal is to maximize the balance, which is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through potential divisors of `x` (up to the square root of `x`) and checks if it's possible to split `x` into `n` parts where each part's difficulty is a multiple of the divisor. It then updates the maximum balance accordingly.

### Key Points:
1. **Finding Divisors**: The program considers all divisors of `x` up to its square root.
2. **Checking Feasibility**: For each divisor `i`, it checks if it's possible to split `x` into `n` parts where each part's difficulty is a multiple of `i`.
3. **Updating Maximum Balance**: It updates the maximum balance if the current divisor can be used to split `x` into `n` parts with the same difficulty.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Small Values**: When `x` and `n` are small.
2. **Large Values**: When `x` and `n` are large, ensuring the program handles large numbers efficiently.
3. **Edge Cases**: When `x` is a prime number or `n` is equal to `x`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example and some additional edge cases.

#### Example Test Case:
- **Input**: `3\n10 3\n5 5\n420 69`
- **Expected Output**: `2\n1\n6`

Running the program with these inputs:
- For `x=10` and `n=3`, it correctly outputs `2`.
- For `x=5` and `n=5`, it correctly outputs `1`.
- For `x=420` and `n=69`, it correctly outputs `6`.

#### Additional Test Cases:
1. **Small Values**: `x=1` and `n=1` (Expected Output: `1`)
2. **Prime Number**: `x=7` and `n=1` (Expected Output: `7`)
3. **Large Values**: `x=100000000` and `n=1` (Expected Output: `100000000`)

Running the program with these additional test cases:
- For `x=1` and `n=1`, it correctly outputs `1`.
- For `x=7` and `n=1`, it correctly outputs `7`.
- For `x=100000000` and `n=1`, it correctly outputs `100000000`.

### Conclusion:
After testing the program with various test cases, including edge cases, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the maximum balance for different values of `x` and `n`.

Correctness: **True**.

The program efficiently finds the maximum balance by iterating through the divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to split `x` into `n` parts with the same difficulty. It handles small and large values of `x` and `n` correctly, and it also handles edge cases like prime numbers and when `n` is equal to `x`.
