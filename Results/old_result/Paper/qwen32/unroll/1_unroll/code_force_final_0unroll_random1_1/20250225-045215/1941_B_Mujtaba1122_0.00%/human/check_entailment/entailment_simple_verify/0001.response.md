### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine whether it is possible to reduce all elements of an array to zero using the specified operation:
- Choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`).
- Decrease `a[i-1]` by 1.
- Decrease `a[i]` by 2.
- Decrease `a[i+1]` by 1.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements of the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is not zero.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the described operation.
   - It iterates over the array from the second element to the second last element (i.e., from index 1 to `n-2`).
   - For each element `a[i]` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`), it enters a while loop that continues as long as `a[i] > 1` and both `a[i-1]` and `a[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - Inside the while loop, the program incorrectly modifies the elements of the array:
     - Instead of decreasing `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1, it subtracts `a[i-1]` times 1 from `a[i-1]`, `a[i]` times 2 from `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` times 1 from `a[i+1]`.
     - This is a logical error because it does not correctly apply the operation as specified in the problem description.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" if they are, otherwise it prints "NO".

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations.
- They correctly note the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2`.
- The annotations also correctly describe the intended behavior of `func_1`.

#### Correctness:
The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the implementation of the operation in `func_2`. The operation should decrease `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1, but the program incorrectly subtracts multiples of `a[i-1]` from the respective elements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the specified operation, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
