Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of `t` test cases. Each test case is a tuple `(n, a)`, where `n` is the number of signs and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the first common year when all signs change for the corresponding test case.**
