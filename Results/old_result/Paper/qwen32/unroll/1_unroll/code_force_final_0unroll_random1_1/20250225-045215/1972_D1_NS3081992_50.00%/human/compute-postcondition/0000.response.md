The code snippet `n, m = func_7()` assigns the values returned by the function `func_7()` to the variables `n` and `m`. Since the function `func_7()` is not defined in the provided information, we can only state that `n` and `m` will take on whatever values are returned by `func_7()`. The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6 will still hold true after the code execution, but their specific values will be determined by the return values of `func_7()`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, where `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`.**
