To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy specific conditions related to their prefix and suffix maximums. The prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum in the prefix ending at that element, and the suffix maximums are the elements that are the maximum in the suffix starting at that element.

Given the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums, we need to count the number of permutations that could have produced these maximums.

### Solution Approach

The solution involves combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic. The provided code uses a function to calculate modular inverses, which is often required in combinatorial problems to handle division under modulo.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`

This function calculates the extended Euclidean algorithm, which is used to find integers `c` and `d` such that:

\[ a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b) \]

If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0)`, which is the base case. If `a < b`, it swaps `a` and `b` and calls itself recursively. If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and then adjusts the results.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`

This function calculates the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007` using `func_1` and then multiplies it by `a`, taking the result modulo `1000000007`.

### Code Evaluation

The provided code seems to be a part of a larger solution, but it does not include the main logic for counting permutations. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented for calculating the modular inverse, which is a crucial part of the solution.

However, the main part of the solution, which should count the permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums, is missing. The problem requires a combination of combinatorial counting and handling of constraints, which is not addressed by the provided code snippet.

### Conclusion

Since the provided code only includes helper functions for modular arithmetic and does not contain the main logic for solving the problem, it is incomplete. Therefore, the correctness of the entire program cannot be determined based on the given code snippet alone.

**Correctness: False**
