In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `tc` and it iterates over the range defined by `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, as the range function will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts is that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is within this range to make sure the loop executes. 

Since `t` is already described as being within the valid range (1 to 10^4), no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. The loop variable `tc` will automatically be set to 0 for the first iteration when the loop starts, so no adjustment is needed for `tc` either.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already appropriate for the loop to execute given the constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
