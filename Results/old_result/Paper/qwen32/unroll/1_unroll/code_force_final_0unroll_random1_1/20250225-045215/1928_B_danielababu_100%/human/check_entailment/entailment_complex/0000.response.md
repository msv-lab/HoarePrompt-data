### Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array `a` after adding some permutation to the array `a`. The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers, and for each array, it calculates and prints the desired maximum frequency.

Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` using `func_3()`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The array `a` is first converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted.
   - The variable `m` is set to the maximum value in the sorted array, although this variable is not used in the subsequent logic.
   - The program then iterates over the sorted array and uses `bisect_left` to find the position `a` where elements are greater than or equal to `arr[i] + n`. The difference `d = a - i` represents the number of elements that can be made equal to `arr[i] + k` for some `k` by adding a permutation.
   - The variable `ans` keeps track of the maximum value of `d` across all iterations.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum value of `d`, which is the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.

### Verification:
The logic of the program is correct based on the problem statement. Here is why:

- **Removing Duplicates:** By converting the array to a set and then sorting it, the program ensures that each unique element is considered only once, which is essential for finding the maximum frequency efficiently.
- **Using `bisect_left`:** The use of `bisect_left` helps efficiently find the range of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. This is crucial for the problem, as it avoids the need for a nested loop to compare each element with every other element.
- **Calculating Maximum Frequency:** By iterating over the sorted array and calculating the difference `d`, the program correctly finds the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
