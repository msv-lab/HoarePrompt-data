The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a balanced parentheses sequence. It prints a string formed by rearranging the characters of `s` based on the balance and position of each parenthesis, sorted first by balance and then by the negative position. The function does not return any value.
