To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic of the game and the provided solution.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns, with Alice starting.
   - On each turn, a player can optionally swap wallets with the opponent.
   - Then, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when their wallet has zero coins) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is symmetric and the first player (Alice) can force a win or a loss based on the total number of coins `(a + b)`.

3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice to lose.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, ensuring Alice's win.

### Program Analysis:
- The program consists of two functions:
  - `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
  - `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

- **Logic in `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the function returns `'Bob'`, indicating Bob wins.
  - Otherwise, it returns `'Alice'`, indicating Alice wins.

This logic aligns with the winning strategy derived from the game analysis.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total number of coins `(a + b)`. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
