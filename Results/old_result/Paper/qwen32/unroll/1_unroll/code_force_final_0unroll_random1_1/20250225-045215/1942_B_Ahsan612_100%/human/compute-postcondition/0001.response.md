To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the provided code. The code processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `ar`. For each test case, it constructs a new list `res` where each element is calculated based on the current `mex` value and the corresponding element in `ar`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's behavior for a single test case:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values with length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from the last element of `ar` to the first element.
   - For each element `ar[i]` in `ar`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in `ar`, the list `res` is printed.

The key point here is that `mex` starts at `n` and decreases as the loop progresses, but it never goes below 0 because of the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`.

Let's consider the final state after all test cases have been processed:

- The variable `t` will remain unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the list `ar` will be processed, and a new list `res` will be created and printed.
- The variable `mex` is local to each test case and does not persist between test cases.

After all test cases have been processed, the only variable that retains its initial value is `t`. The lists `ar` and `res` are specific to each test case and are not retained after the test case is processed.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a list `res` of n integers is printed where each integer `res_i` is calculated as `mex - ar_i` with `mex` starting at `n` and decreasing as the loop progresses.**
