To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n_cases`. The loop will execute if `n_cases` is greater than 0 because `range(n_cases)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, `n_cases`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `n_cases` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be at least 1, as `range(0)` would result in an empty sequence, and the loop would not execute.

The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted beforehand, as it will take on the values from the range during each iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n_cases` is greater than 0.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0**
