Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the integer input, representing the number of test cases. The initial state of the string `a` and the integer `n` for each test case remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms: The variable `t` now holds the number of test cases provided by the input. The values of `n` and `a` for each test case are still as they were in the initial state.
