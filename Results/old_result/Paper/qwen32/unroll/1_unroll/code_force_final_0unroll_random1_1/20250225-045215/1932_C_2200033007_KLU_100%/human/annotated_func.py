#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':

            l += 1

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list of length n containing elements from `a` in an order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is n, `r` is -1.

    #State: `b` is a list of length n containing elements from `a` in an order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is n, `r` is -1; `ans` is a list of cumulative products modulo `m` in the order determined by the reversed `b`; `p` is the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products modulo `m` in the order determined by the reversed `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: an integer `n`, a positive integer `m`, a list `a` of integers of length `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m`, and returns this cumulative product list in reverse order.
