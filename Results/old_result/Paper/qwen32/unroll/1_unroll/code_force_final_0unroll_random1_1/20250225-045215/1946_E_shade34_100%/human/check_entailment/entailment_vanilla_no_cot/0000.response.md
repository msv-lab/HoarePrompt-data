To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires us to calculate the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and then return this count modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The given functions seem to be related to modular arithmetic, specifically for computing modular inverses, which is a common technique in combinatorial problems involving permutations and combinations. However, the provided functions alone do not directly address the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums.

Here's a brief explanation of the functions:

1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean algorithm. It also returns the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which can be used to find the modular inverse if `b` is coprime to `10^9 + 7`.

2. **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a` to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, the program does not contain the logic to determine the number of permutations with the given prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires a combinatorial approach, possibly involving dynamic programming or combinatorial counting, to solve it.

Since the provided code does not include the necessary logic to solve the problem, the correctness of the program based on the given description is:

**Correctness: False**

The program is incomplete and does not address the core problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums.
