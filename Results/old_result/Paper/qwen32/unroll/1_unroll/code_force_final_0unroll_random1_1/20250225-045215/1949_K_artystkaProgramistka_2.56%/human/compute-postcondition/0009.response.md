Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. Here, `n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that their sum equals `n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function returns 'YES' along with three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if it is possible to partition the numbers into these groups such that each group contains `na`, `nb`, and `nc` numbers respectively, sorted in descending order, and the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
