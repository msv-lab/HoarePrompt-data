Output State: **For each test case, the code prints either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition that if the sum of the calculated values in `array2` plus the product of the difference between `n` and the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and the input values for each test case remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing.**
