Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains four integers n, f, a, and b such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9. The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are part of the description of the test cases and not directly affected by the input statement.
