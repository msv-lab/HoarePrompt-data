Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each element in the array \( a \), the relationship \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) holds. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through each test case, reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \), and then attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is an empty list that will store the elements of the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the smallest non-negative integer not yet used.
   - `used` is a dictionary to keep track of which integers have been used in the permutation.

2. **Iterating through the array \( a \)**:
   - For each element in \( a \):
     - If the element \( a[i] \) is greater than 0, it means the MEX at this point minus the current element \( p_i \) is positive. Therefore, the MEX must be greater than \( p_i \). The smallest possible \( p_i \) in this case would be `minn`, and we update `minn` to the next smallest unused integer.
     - If the element \( a[i] \) is less than or equal to 0, the MEX minus \( p_i \) is non-positive. Therefore, \( p_i \) must be \( \text{MEX} - a[i] \). We calculate this value and update `used` to reflect that this integer has been used.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation \( p \) is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check
The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the handling of the case where \( a[i] \) is less than or equal to 0 is incorrect. The program assumes that \( p_i \) should be \( \text{MEX} - a[i] \) without ensuring that this value has not already been used in the permutation \( p \).

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
-1 1 -2
```
The program would output `0 1 2`, but this does not satisfy the condition for the third element:
- \( a_3 = -2 \) means \( \text{MEX}(0, 1, p_3) - p_3 = -2 \).
- If \( p_3 = 2 \), then \( \text{MEX}(0, 1, 2) = 3 \), but \( 3 - 2 \neq -2 \).

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases and may produce invalid permutations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
