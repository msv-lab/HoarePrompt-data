The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `test_cases`. Therefore, the output state will still maintain the initial conditions for `t` and `test_cases`, with `results` being an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases. Each test case is a tuple (n, a), where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers representing the periodicities of the signs, with each integer a_i satisfying 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. `results` is an empty list.**
