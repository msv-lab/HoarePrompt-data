### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program's logic in detail with respect to the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word (consisting of lowercase Latin letters) that sums up to a given integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 78 \)). The sum is calculated by adding the positions of the letters in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic to determine the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word:

1. **Alphabet Mapping:**
   - The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to map each letter to its position in the alphabet.

2. **Logic for Constructing the Word:**
   - If \( n > 52 \):
     - The program constructs the word by choosing the letter corresponding to \( n - 53 \) and appending 'zz'.
   - If \( n > 26 \):
     - The program constructs the word by choosing 'a' and the letter corresponding to \( n - 28 \) and appending 'z'.
   - If \( n \leq 26 \):
     - The program constructs the word by using 'aa' and the letter corresponding to \( n - 3 \).

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case \( n = 24 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 24 \leq 26 \), it constructs the word as 'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3] = 'aa' + 'r' = 'aar'.
   - However, the correct output is 'aav' because 'aav' is lexicographically smaller than 'aar' and sums to 24.

2. **Test Case \( n = 70 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 70 > 52 \), it constructs the word as alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz' = alphabet[17] + 'zz' = 'rzz'.
   - This is correct as 'rzz' sums to 70 and is lexicographically smallest.

3. **Test Case \( n = 3 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 3 \leq 26 \), it constructs the word as 'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3] = 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'.
   - This is correct as 'aaa' sums to 3 and is lexicographically smallest.

4. **Test Case \( n = 55 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 55 > 52 \), it constructs the word as alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz' = alphabet[2] + 'zz' = 'bzz'.
   - However, the correct output is 'czz' because 'czz' is lexicographically smaller than 'bzz' and sums to 55.

5. **Test Case \( n = 48 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 48 > 52 \) is false and \( 48 > 26 \) is true, it constructs the word as 'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + alphabet[20] + 'z' = 'atzz'.
   - However, the correct output is 'auz' because 'auz' is lexicographically smaller than 'atzz' and sums to 48.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is flawed for cases where \( n \leq 52 \). Specifically, it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for \( n = 24 \), the correct output is 'aav', not 'aar'. Similarly, for \( n = 55 \), the correct output is 'czz', not 'bzz', and for \( n = 48 \), the correct output is 'auz', not 'atzz'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
