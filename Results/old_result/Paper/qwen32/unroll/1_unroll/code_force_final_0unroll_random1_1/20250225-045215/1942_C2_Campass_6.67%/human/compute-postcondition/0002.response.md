To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the variables involved in it.

The `while` loop statement is:
```
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the condition is `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is a truthy value. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since `t` is already described as a positive integer, it is guaranteed to be non-zero, and thus the loop can certainly execute one time. No adjustment is needed for `t`.

The other variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and the function `R` do not appear in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it is right before the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer.**
