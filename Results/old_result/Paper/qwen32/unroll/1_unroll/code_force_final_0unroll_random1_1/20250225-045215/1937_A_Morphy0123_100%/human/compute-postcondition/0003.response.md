Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of an array. The function does not explicitly return any value, but based on the context, it is implied that it might perform operations or produce outputs related to each `n` provided in the test cases.**
