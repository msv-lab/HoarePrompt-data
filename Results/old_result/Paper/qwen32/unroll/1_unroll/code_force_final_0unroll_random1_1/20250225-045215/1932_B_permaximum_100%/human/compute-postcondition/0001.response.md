The only objects in the loop head are the variable `test` and the list `test_cases`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one test case for the loop to execute. The variable `test` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it will be assigned the first element of `test_cases` during the first iteration.

According to the problem statement, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, ensuring that `test_cases` contains at least one test case. The variable `results` is an empty list and does not affect whether the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where `t` is at least 1, and `results` is an empty list**.
