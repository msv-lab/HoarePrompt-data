The code provided calls `func_5(l)`, where `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`. This function call does not directly affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `l`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_4()`, and `l` remains the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is not equal to 0, `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`.**
