The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `distance` to 0. None of the other variables (`a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of monsters, `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0.**
