To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1(a, b)`. Since the function `func_1(a, b)` is not defined in the provided code, we can only infer that it likely determines the winner based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Given the loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads new values for `a` and `b`, computes the winner using `func_1(a, b)`, and appends the result to the `results` list, the final output state will be the `results` list containing the winners for each test case.

Since the initial state of `results` is an empty list, after `t` iterations, `results` will contain `t` elements, each representing the winner of each test case.

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **results is a list of length t, where each element is the result of func_1(a, b) for the corresponding test case.**
