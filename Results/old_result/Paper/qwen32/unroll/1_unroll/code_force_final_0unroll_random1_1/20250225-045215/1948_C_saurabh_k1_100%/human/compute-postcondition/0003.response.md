Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The function returns "YES" if it is possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that they can be matched without crossing arrows; otherwise, it returns "NO".**
