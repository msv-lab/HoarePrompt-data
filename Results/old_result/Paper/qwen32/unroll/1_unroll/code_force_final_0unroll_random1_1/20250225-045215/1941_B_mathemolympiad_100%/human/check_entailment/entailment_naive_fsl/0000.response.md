Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Operations**: The program attempts to reduce the array elements by performing operations starting from the beginning of the array. However, it does not handle the possibility of having to perform operations from different indices multiple times or in a different order. The operations can be performed on any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) any number of times, and the program does not account for this flexibility.

2. **Handling of Negative Values**: The program checks if any element becomes negative during the operations and immediately prints "NO" if it does. While it is true that negative values indicate an invalid state, the program does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero even if no negative values are encountered.

3. **Final Check**: After performing the operations, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. However, it does not ensure that all elements are zero. The program should check if all elements in the array are zero after attempting to reduce them.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
2 4 4 4 2
```
The correct output should be "YES" because the operations can be applied as follows:
- Apply the operation at `i=2`: [2, 2, 2, 4, 2]
- Apply the operation at `i=2`: [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]
- Apply the operation at `i=3`: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- Apply the operation at `i=1`: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

However, the provided program will not correctly handle this case because it does not perform the operations in an optimal or flexible manner.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases and does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero using the described operations.
