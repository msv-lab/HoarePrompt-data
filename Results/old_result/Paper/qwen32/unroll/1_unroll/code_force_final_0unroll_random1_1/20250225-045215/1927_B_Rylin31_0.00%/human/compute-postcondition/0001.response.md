To understand the output state, let's break down the code and its behavior:

1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(int(input()))`)**:
   - This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Inner Loop and Logic**:
   - For each test case, the input `l` (length of the array) and the array `array` are read.
   - `alp` is a list of the first 26 lowercase English letters.
   - `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
   - For each element in `rev_array` (using index `j`), the code calculates the count of `rev_array[j]` in the slice `rev_array[j:]` and subtracts 1 from it. This count represents the position of the character in the alphabet list `alp`.
   - The character corresponding to this position is appended to `ans`.
   - Finally, the list `ans` is joined into a string and printed.

The output for each test case is a string formed by the characters in `alp` based on the calculated positions.

**Output State:**
- The output state consists of `t` strings, each corresponding to a test case.
- Each string is formed by mapping the counts of elements in the reversed array to characters in the alphabet list `alp`.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **t strings, each string is formed by mapping the counts of elements in the reversed array to characters in the alphabet list `alp`.**
