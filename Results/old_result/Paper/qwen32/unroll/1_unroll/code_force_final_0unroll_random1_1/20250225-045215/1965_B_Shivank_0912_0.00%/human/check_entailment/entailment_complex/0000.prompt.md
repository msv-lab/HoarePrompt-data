Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

# Annotated Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
cases = []
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    cases.append((n, k))
    index += 2
results = func_1(t, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result[0])
    print(' '.join(map(str, result[1])))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all tuples in cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; results is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer 25 and the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]; sequence is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]
    return results
    #The program returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer 25 and the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `cases`, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer 25 and a predefined list of powers of 2 up to 2^24, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.
