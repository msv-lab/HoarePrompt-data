Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input. The precondition regarding the range of `t` remains valid. The information about the test cases with integers `a` and `b` remains unchanged as the code provided only reads the value of `t`.
