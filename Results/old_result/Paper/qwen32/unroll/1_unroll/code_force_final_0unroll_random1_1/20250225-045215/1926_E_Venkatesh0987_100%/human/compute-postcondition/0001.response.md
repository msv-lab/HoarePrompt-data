To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the provided code and understand how it processes each test case. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and then performs different operations based on the value of `k` relative to `(n + 1) // 2`.

Let's break down the operations:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `s = 0`: Sum accumulator.
   - `i = 0`: Counter for operations.
   - `d = n`: Copy of `n` for decrement operations.
   - `h = n`: Another copy of `n` for decrement operations.
   - `p = 1`: Counter for another loop.
   - `g = 0`: Another sum accumulator.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, it enters the first `while` loop.
     - This loop continues until `s < k` and `d > 0`.
     - In each iteration, it adds `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` and subtracts the same value from `d`, increments `i`.
   - After the first `while` loop, it enters another `while` loop.
     - This loop continues until `p <= i - 1`.
     - In each iteration, it adds `(h + 1) // 2` to `g` and subtracts the same value from `h`, increments `p`.
   - Finally, it calculates `f = k - g` and `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`, and prints `y`.
   - If `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, it directly prints `2 * k - 1`.

Given the above operations, let's summarize the output state:

- The variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are not retained between test cases; they are reinitialized for each test case.
- The only output from each test case is a single integer printed to the console.
- The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged and does not affect the output of each test case.

Thus, the output state after all iterations will be the series of printed integers for each test case.

Output State: **a series of integers printed for each test case based on the provided logic.**
