Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`. The parameter `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and both `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters. The function returns 'No' in Case_1 and 'Yes' in Case_2.**
