Let's walk through the logic of the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to determine the year in which all `n` signs will occur sequentially, such that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. Each sign `i` occurs every `a_i` years.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates over each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - For each periodicity `ai`, it determines the next occurrence of the sign:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next occurrence is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - It updates `current_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.
   - After processing all signs, `current_year` contains the year when the last sign occurs, and hence, the apocalypse happens.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the `current_year` for each test case.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- Processing:
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign (periodicity 3):
    - `current_year % 3 != 0`, so `next_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
    - `current_year = 3`.
  - Second sign (periodicity 2):
    - `current_year % 2 != 0`, so `next_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
    - `current_year = 4`.
  - Third sign (periodicity 4):
    - `current_year % 4 != 0`, so `next_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
    - `current_year = 8`.
  - Fourth sign (periodicity 5):
    - `current_year % 5 != 0`, so `next_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
    - `current_year = 10`.
  - Fifth sign (periodicity 9):
    - `current_year % 9 != 0`, so `next_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
    - `current_year = 18`.
  - Sixth sign (periodicity 18):
    - `current_year % 18 != 0`, so `next_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.
    - `current_year = 36`.
- Output:
  ```
  36
  ```

The program correctly computes the year when the last sign occurs, as per the provided example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the last sign occurs, following the rules described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
