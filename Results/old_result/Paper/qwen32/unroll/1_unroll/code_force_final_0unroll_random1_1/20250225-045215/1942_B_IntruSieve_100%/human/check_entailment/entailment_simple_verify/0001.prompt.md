You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each element in the array \( a \), the relationship \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) holds. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through each test case, reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \), and then attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is an empty list that will store the elements of the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the smallest non-negative integer not yet used.
   - `used` is a dictionary to keep track of which integers have been used in the permutation.

2. **Iterating through the array \( a \)**:
   - For each element in \( a \):
     - If the element \( a[i] \) is greater than 0, it means the MEX at this point minus the current element \( p_i \) is positive. Therefore, the MEX must be greater than \( p_i \). The smallest possible \( p_i \) in this case would be `minn`, and we update `minn` to the next smallest unused integer.
     - If the element \( a[i] \) is less than or equal to 0, the MEX minus \( p_i \) is non-positive. Therefore, \( p_i \) must be \( \text{MEX} - a[i] \). We calculate this value and update `used` to reflect that this integer has been used.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation \( p \) is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check
The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the handling of the case where \( a[i] \) is less than or equal to 0 is incorrect. The program assumes that \( p_i \) should be \( \text{MEX} - a[i] \) without ensuring that this value has not already been used in the permutation \( p \).

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
-1 1 -2
```
The program would output `0 1 2`, but this does not satisfy the condition for the third element:
- \( a_3 = -2 \) means \( \text{MEX}(0, 1, p_3) - p_3 = -2 \).
- If \( p_3 = 2 \), then \( \text{MEX}(0, 1, 2) = 3 \), but \( 3 - 2 \neq -2 \).

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases and may produce invalid permutations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
