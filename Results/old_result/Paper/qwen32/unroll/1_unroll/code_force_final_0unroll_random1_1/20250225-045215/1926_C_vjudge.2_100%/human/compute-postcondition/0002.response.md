The code snippet creates a list `pd` with 200001 elements, all initialized to 0. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros.**
