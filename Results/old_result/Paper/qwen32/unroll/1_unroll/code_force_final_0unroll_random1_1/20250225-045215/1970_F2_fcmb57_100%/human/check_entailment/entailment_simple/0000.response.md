### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program against the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Initialization and Parsing Input:**
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It reads the field configuration and stores the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It initializes the starting position of the Quaffle and the middle of the field.
   - It initializes the points for both teams to zero.

2. **Processing Movements:**
   - The program iterates through each move, updating the positions of the entities based on the actions.
   - It handles the movement of the Quaffle, players, and the Bludger.
   - It checks for collisions with the Bludger and eliminates players if necessary.
   - It correctly handles catching and throwing the Quaffle.
   - It checks if the Quaffle is thrown into a goal and updates the score accordingly.

3. **Handling Goal Scoring:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle into a goal, the program correctly determines which team scores the point.
   - If the Quaffle is thrown into the wrong goal, the program awards the point to the opposing team.
   - It resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the events of the game in the correct format and order.
   - It prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Issues in the Code:

Upon closer inspection, there are a couple of issues in the code that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Assignment in Catch Action:**
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`. The current code is a comparison, not an assignment, so the Quaffle is never actually caught by the player.

2. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic:**
   - The program checks for the Quaffle being in the goals with two separate `if` statements, which is incorrect. If the Quaffle is in a goal, it should only execute one of the blocks. This can be fixed by using an `if-elif` structure.

### Corrected Code Snippet:

```python
if mo[0] == '.Q':
    quidditch[0] = func_1(quidditch[0], mouvements[mo[1]])
elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
    players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
    if '.B' in players:
        elimines = []
        for (k, v) in players.items():
            if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                elimines.append(k)
        elimines.sort()
        for c in elimines:
            print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
            if quidditch[1] == c:
                quidditch = [players[c], '']
            del players[c]
elif mo[1] == 'C':
    quidditch[1] = mo[0]  # Corrected assignment
elif mo[1] == 'T':
    quidditch[1] = ''
    if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
        pointsb += 1
        print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        quidditch[0] = middle
    elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:  # Changed to elif
        pointsr += 1
        print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        quidditch[0] = middle
```

### Conclusion:

After addressing the issues, the program should work correctly according to the problem description. However, as it stands, the current implementation has errors. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
