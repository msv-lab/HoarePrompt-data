Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both `x` and `y` have the same length. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
