### Reasoning:

The provided code and its annotated version seem to correctly implement the strategy to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest available numbers in pairs. Let's break down the logic and validate it step-by-step using the problem description and the annotations:

1. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order (`l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))`). This step ensures that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.

2. **Iterating with Step of 2**: The loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` iterates through the sorted list with a step of 2. This means that for each iteration, `l[i]` is the smallest number in the current pair `(l[i], l[i+1])` because the list is sorted.

3. **Adding to Score**: Inside the loop, `score += l[i]` adds the smaller number of each pair to the score. Since `l` is sorted, `l[i]` is always the smaller number in the pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`, ensuring that the score is maximized by always choosing the smallest available number in each pair.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The outer loop `for _ in range(int(input()))` correctly handles multiple test cases by resetting the score and processing each test case independently.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call**: The annotations confirm that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), and `a` is a list of \(2n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- **Inside the function**: The annotations confirm that the list `l` is sorted, and the score is computed by summing up every second element starting from the first element of the sorted list.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided problem description, the code logic, and the annotations, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The code correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always picking the smallest number in each pair, and it handles multiple test cases as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
