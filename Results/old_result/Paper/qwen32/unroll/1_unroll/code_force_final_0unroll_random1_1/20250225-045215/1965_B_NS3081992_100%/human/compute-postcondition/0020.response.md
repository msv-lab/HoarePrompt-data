To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `lk`, and `l`. The loop condition `for i in range(lk, l)` indicates that the loop will execute if `lk` is less than `l`.

Let's break down the necessary conditions:

1. **`lk` and `l`**: For the loop to execute, `lk` must be less than `l`. The values of `lk` and `l` are the lengths of the binary representations of `k` and `n`, respectively.

2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to `lk` when the loop starts. We do not need to adjust `i` directly since it is automatically set by the `range` function.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `lk` is less than `l`.

### State Adjustment
- Ensure that `lk` (length of binary `k`) is less than `l` (length of binary `n`).

### Example Adjustment
- Suppose `n` is 10, then `b` is "1010" and `l` is 4.
- Suppose `k` is 3, then `bk` is "11" and `lk` is 2.
- In this case, `lk` (2) is less than `l` (4), so the loop will execute.

### Final State
State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, `ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(l-1), k - 2^l, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`, `lk` must be less than `l`**

This ensures that the loop `for i in range(lk, l)` will execute.
