To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state so that the condition `num != 0` evaluates to `True`.

Given the loop statement:
```
while num != 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The condition `num != 0` implies that the loop will execute as long as `num` is not equal to 0. Here, `num` is a list of integers, and the condition `num != 0` will be `True` if `num` is not an empty list (since an empty list is considered `False` in a boolean context in Python).

In the provided state, `num` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. This means `num` is guaranteed to be non-empty, and thus `num != 0` will always be `True`.

Since the condition is already satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the length of `num` is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive; `a` is 0**
