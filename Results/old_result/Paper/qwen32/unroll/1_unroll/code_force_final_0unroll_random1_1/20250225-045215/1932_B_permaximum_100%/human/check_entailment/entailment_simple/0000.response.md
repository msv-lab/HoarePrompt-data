### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case, given the periodicities of the signs. The program iterates through each test case and for each sign within the test case, it calculates the next occurrence year based on the current year and the periodicity of the sign. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the `current_year` is initialized to 0. This represents the starting year for the sequence of signs.

2. **Iteration through signs**: For each periodicity `ai` in the list of periodicities `a`:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign is `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`. This is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - The `current_year` is then updated to this `next_year`.

3. **Result collection**: After processing all signs for a test case, the final `current_year` is the year in which the n-th sign occurs, and this value is appended to the `results` list.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the results for each test case.

The logic correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. The program ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one and calculates the correct year for the n-th sign to occur.

### Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case. The reasoning matches the problem requirements and the annotated states of the program are consistent with the expected behavior.
