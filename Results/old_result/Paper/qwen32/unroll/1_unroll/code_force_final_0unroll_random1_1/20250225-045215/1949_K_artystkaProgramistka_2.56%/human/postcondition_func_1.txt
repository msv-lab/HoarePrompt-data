The function accepts a positive integer `n`, three positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` such that their sum equals `n`, and a list of `n` positive integers `numbers`. It returns 'YES' along with three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if it is possible to partition the numbers into these groups such that `group_a` contains `na` numbers, `group_b` contains `nb` numbers, and `group_c` contains `nc` numbers, and the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
