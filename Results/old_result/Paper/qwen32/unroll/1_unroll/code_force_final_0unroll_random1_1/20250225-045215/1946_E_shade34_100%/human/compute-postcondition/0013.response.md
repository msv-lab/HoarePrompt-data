Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, the function returns either (1, 0) if `b` is 0, or a tuple representing the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity for `a` and `b`. Specifically, it returns a tuple `(x, y)` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.**
