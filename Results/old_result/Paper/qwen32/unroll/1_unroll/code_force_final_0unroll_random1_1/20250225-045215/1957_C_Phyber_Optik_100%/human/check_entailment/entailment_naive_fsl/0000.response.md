Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program seems to attempt to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there are several issues and potential cases where it does not work as expected.

1. **Initialization and Use of `dp` Array**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007, but the function `func_1` is called with an argument of 300000 before it's defined. This will result in an error.
   - The `dp` array is supposed to store the number of configurations for a given number of free rows/columns, but the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code. Without this function, the `dp` array cannot be properly populated, making the program incomplete.

2. **Handling of Invalid Rows and Columns**:
   - The program uses a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, it adds both `r` and `c` to the same set, which is incorrect. The program should maintain separate sets for rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - The program calculates the number of free rows/columns by subtracting the length of the `invalid` set from `n`. This is incorrect because the `invalid` set will contain both row and column indices, leading to an incorrect count of free rows/columns.

3. **Dynamic Programming Formula**:
   - The formula used in the dynamic programming approach (if `func_1` were defined) seems to be incorrect. The problem requires calculating the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other and considering the mirroring rule. The provided formula does not account for the mirroring rule and the specific constraints of the problem.

4. **Mirroring Rule**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the mirroring rule. If a player places a rook at `(r, c)`, the computer should place a rook at `(c, r)`, except when `r = c`. The program does not implement this rule correctly, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `k = 0` or `k = n` correctly. When `k = 0`, the board is completely free, and the number of configurations should be based on the size of the board. When `k = n`, there are no more valid moves, and the number of configurations should be 1 if the board is fully occupied without conflicts.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 0
```
The program should output `36` (since there are 4 rows and 4 columns, and each row and column can be independently chosen for placing rooks). However, the program will not produce the correct result due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these points, the program is incorrect.
