Let's systematically analyze the provided Python program against the problem description and the function summaries.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX (minimum excluded non-negative integer) value. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

### Code Analysis:

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
```
- **Issue 1**: The function attempts to set the subarray to `0` if `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`. This is incorrect because setting `a[l]` to `0` does not help maximize the sum.
- **Issue 2**: The recursive call `func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)` is made before checking if `a[l] != r - l + 1`. This means the function is not correctly setting the MEX value for the subarray.
- **Issue 3**: The logic for setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` is flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)
```
- **Issue**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing `a` and `ops` as arguments. This will result in a `NameError`.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
```python
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
```
- **Issue 1**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined to accept `a` and `ops` as parameters, leading to `NameError`.
- **Issue 2**: The logic for splitting the array based on the maximum value is not aligned with the goal of maximizing the sum by setting subarrays to their MEX values.
- **Issue 3**: The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a valid way to determine when to apply `func_1`.

#### Function `func_3`:
```python
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
```
- **Issue**: This function correctly reads input and processes it using `func_2`, but `func_2` has significant issues as described above.

### Conclusion:
The provided code has several fundamental issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. The logic for computing the MEX value and applying operations to maximize the sum is flawed, and there are missing arguments in function calls.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
