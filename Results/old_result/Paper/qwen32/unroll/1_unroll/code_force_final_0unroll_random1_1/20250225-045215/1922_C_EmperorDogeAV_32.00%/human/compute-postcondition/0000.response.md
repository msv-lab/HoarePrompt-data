The code snippet provided initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n - 1` zeros. Given the initial state, `n` is the number of cities in each test case, and it is provided that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities in each test case. Additionally, each test case includes `m` queries, where `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, followed by `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` filled with zeros.**

In simpler terms: The `prog_cities` list has been initialized with `n - 1` zeros, while all other details about the `cities` list and the queries remain unchanged.
