The code provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `i`, but it does not affect the values of `n` and `m`. Since `n` and `m` are already defined as positive integers returned by `func_7()`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, where `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`. `i` is 1.**
