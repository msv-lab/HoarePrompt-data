#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, and b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, with 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns the tuple (x + dx, y + dy)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples, `a` and `b`, where `a` contains two integers `(x, y)` and `b` contains two integers `(dx, dy)`. It returns a new tuple representing the sum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`, i.e., `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
