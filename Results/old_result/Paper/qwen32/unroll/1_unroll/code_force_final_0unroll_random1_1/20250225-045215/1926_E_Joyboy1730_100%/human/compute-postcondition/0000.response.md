Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**

In this output state, `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, which is within the specified range. The preconditions for the test cases (n and k) remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the code snippet provided.
