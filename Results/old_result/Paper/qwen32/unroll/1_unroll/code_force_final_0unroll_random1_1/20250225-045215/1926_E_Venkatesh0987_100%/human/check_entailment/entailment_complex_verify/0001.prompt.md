You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: a series of integers printed for each test case based on the provided logic.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer result based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is greater than half of `n` rounded up, it performs a series of calculations involving `n` and `k` to derive the result. Otherwise, it directly computes the result as `2 * k - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Odd-numbered cards** (1, 3, 5, 7, ...) are laid down first.
2. **Cards that are twice an odd number** (2, 6, 10, 14, ...) are laid down next.
3. **Cards that are three times an odd number** (3, 9, 15, 21, ...) are laid down next.
4. This process continues until all cards are laid down.

### Key Observations:
- The first step involves laying down all odd numbers up to `n`.
- The second step involves laying down numbers that are twice odd numbers, and so on.
- For a given `k`, we need to determine which step in this process the `k`-th card falls into.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this by:
1. Checking if `k` is greater than the number of odd numbers up to `n` (i.e., `(n + 1) // 2`).
2. If `k` is greater, it calculates the step `i` where the `k`-th card falls into by decrementing the count of available cards in each step.
3. It then calculates the `k`-th card based on the step `i` and the position within that step.

### Detailed Steps in the Program:
1. If `k` is within the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards, it directly computes the `k`-th card as `2 * k - 1` (which correctly computes the `k`-th odd number).
2. If `k` is greater, it calculates the step `i` and the position `f` within that step to determine the `k`-th card as `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Odd Numbers**: The program correctly computes the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards as `2 * k - 1` for `k` from 1 to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- **Subsequent Steps**: For `k` greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program correctly calculates the step `i` and the position `f` to determine the `k`-th card.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For `n = 7` and `k = 5`:
  - The first 4 cards are `1, 3, 5, 7`.
  - The 5th card is the first card that is twice an odd number, which is `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the `k`-th card laid down according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
