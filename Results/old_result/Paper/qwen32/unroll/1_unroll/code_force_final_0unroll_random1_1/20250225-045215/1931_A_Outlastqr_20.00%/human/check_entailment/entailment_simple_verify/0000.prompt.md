You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, `n` is the value from the last iteration, `word` is the string constructed in the last iteration based on that value of `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly handles all possible cases according to the problem description.

The provided code attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word for a given encoded integer `n` by checking different ranges of `n` and constructing the word accordingly. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Range Handling**: The code incorrectly handles the ranges for constructing the word. For example, the conditions `n > 52` and `n > 26` do not correctly reflect the logic needed to construct the smallest word. The logic should consider how to distribute the sum `n` among the three letters in a way that results in the smallest possible lexicographical order.

2. **Incorrect Indexing**: The code uses `alphabet[n - 53]`, `alphabet[n - 28]`, and `alphabet[n - 3]` to select characters. These indices can go out of bounds or not correctly represent the smallest possible letters.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly handle edge cases, such as when `n` is 3 (which should result in "aaa") or when `n` is 78 (which should result in "zzz").

Let's consider a few test cases to demonstrate the issues:

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`
  - Expected Output: "aaa"
  - Current Output: "aa`" (where `` is the character at index -1 in the alphabet, which is out of bounds and undefined)

- **Test Case 78**: `n = 78`
  - Expected Output: "zzz"
  - Current Output: "z`z" (where `` is the character at index 25 in the alphabet, which is 'z', but the first character should be 'z' as well)

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum `n` is distributed among the three letters in such a way that the resulting word is the smallest possible lexicographically. This can be achieved by greedily assigning the smallest possible letters first and adjusting the remaining sum accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        # Distribute the remaining sum
        remaining = n - 3
        if remaining > 25:
            c += 25
            remaining -= 25
        else:
            c += remaining
            remaining = 0
        if remaining > 0:
            b += remaining
        # Construct the word
        word = alphabet[a-1] + alphabet[b-1] + alphabet[c-1]
        print(word)

func()
```

This corrected code ensures that the sum `n` is correctly distributed among the three letters to form the smallest possible lexicographical word.
