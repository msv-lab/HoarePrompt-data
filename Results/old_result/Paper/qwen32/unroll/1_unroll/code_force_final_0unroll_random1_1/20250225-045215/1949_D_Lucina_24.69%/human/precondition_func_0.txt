n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', where 'F' denotes a funny transition video, 'S' denotes a scary transition video, '?' denotes an undecided transition video, and '.' denotes the same scenario (i.e., i=j). The input is symmetric, meaning the j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line. There are at most floor(n/2) characters in the input that are either 'F' or 'S'.
