Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they each have in their wallets. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. 

The game can be analyzed using the following logic:
- If the sum of the coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins.
- If the sum of the coins (a + b) is odd, Alice wins.

This is because:
- When the sum is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he is the one to make the last move and win.
- When the sum is odd, Alice can start by making a move that leaves an even sum for Bob, putting her in a winning position.

The provided `func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of the coins and returning the appropriate winner based on the described rules. The `func_2` function correctly handles the input/output operations, reading multiple test cases and applying `func_1` to each pair of inputs.

Since both functions work together as intended and the logic aligns with the problem description, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
