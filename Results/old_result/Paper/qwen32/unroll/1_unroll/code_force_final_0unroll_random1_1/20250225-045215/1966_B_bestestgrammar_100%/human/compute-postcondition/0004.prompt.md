You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. Following these integers, there are n lines, each containing a string of m characters ('W' or 'B') representing the initial colors of the squares in the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the output is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop. The grid `gr` and the variables `n`, `m`, and `ans` are specific to each iteration and do not persist after the loop completes. The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to the result of each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each ('W' or 'B') representing the grid's initial colors. The function returns a result for each test case, which is not specified in the given information, but it is implied to be based on the analysis of the grid's colors.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
