You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns a tuple where the first element is the remainder of `b` divided by `a` (which is `d`), and the second element is the quotient of `b` divided by `a` (which is `c`).
    #State: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns the tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where 'a' is divisible by 'b' and 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b'.
    #State: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, the function returns different tuples as follows:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the tuple (1, 0)

Case_2: The program returns a tuple where the first element is the remainder of `b` divided by `a` (which is `d`), and the second element is the quotient of `b` divided by `a` (which is `c`).

Case_3: The program returns the tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where 'a' is divisible by 'b' and 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b'.

Case_4: The program returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
