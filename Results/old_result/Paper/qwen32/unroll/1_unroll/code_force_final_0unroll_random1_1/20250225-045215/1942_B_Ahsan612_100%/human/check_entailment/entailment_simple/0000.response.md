### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to construct a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given problem statement. The program iterates through the array `a` in reverse order and calculates each element of the permutation `p` using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`, where `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that has not yet been used in the permutation.

However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation. The `mex` value is not correctly maintained throughout the loop. The `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the constructed part of the permutation `p` so far. The current implementation simply decreases the `mex` value based on the difference between `mex` and `a_i`, which does not guarantee that `mex` will always be the smallest unused integer.

To correctly implement the solution, we need to maintain a set of used integers and update the `mex` accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

In the corrected version:
- We maintain a set `used` to keep track of the integers that have been used in the permutation `p`.
- We update `mex` to be the smallest integer not in `used` before calculating `res[i]`.
- We add `res[i]` to the `used` set after calculating it to ensure it is not reused.

Since the provided program does not correctly maintain the `mex` value, it is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
