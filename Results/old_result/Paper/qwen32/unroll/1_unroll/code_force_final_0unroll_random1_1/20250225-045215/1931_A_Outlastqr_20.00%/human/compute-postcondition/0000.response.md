The provided code snippet imports the lowercase alphabet from the `string` module and assigns it to the variable `alphabet`. The initial state mentions `t` and `n` but does not define them in the code snippet. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `alphabet` is newly introduced and is assigned the string of all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
