#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses in the village. The next line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 if the resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            pk = n / 2

        mini = pow(10, 8)
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:

            zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
            one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
            if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))

            if c1 >= 50:
                final.append(0)
            else:

    #State: The output state consists of a series of printed integers, each representing the result for a test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`, `final`, and `c1` will reflect the state after processing the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of houses and a string indicating the residents' preferences for living on either side of the street. For each test case, it calculates and prints the optimal position to split the houses such that at least 50% of the residents on each side of the split want to live on that side. If no such split exists, it prints either 0 or the total number of houses, depending on which side has a majority of residents.
