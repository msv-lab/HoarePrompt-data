No specific variables are present in the function signature provided. The function `func_2` is designed to read integers from standard input, but based on the given signature alone, there are no variables to describe. However, if we infer from its usage, it likely returns two integers `n` and `k` where `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.
