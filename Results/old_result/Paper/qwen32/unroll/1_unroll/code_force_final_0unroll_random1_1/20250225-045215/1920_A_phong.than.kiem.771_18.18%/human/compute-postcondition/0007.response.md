Given that `to_int` is `True`, the list comprehension will attempt to convert each element in `items` to an integer. The nature of `items` depends on the value of `space`.

- If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by spaces.
- If `space` is `False`, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.

However, since `to_int` is `True`, the code will attempt to convert each element of `items` to an integer, regardless of whether `space` is `True` or `False`.

Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in `items`. If `space` is `True`, `items` consists of substrings split by spaces from `line`, and if `space` is `False`, `items` consists of individual characters from `line`. Each substring or character in `items` must be convertible to an integer for the conversion to succeed.**
