Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` where `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and two lists `a` and `b` each containing `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
