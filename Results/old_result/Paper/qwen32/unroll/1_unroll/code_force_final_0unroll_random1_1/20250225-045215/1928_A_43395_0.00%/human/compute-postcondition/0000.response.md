The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value represents the number of test cases, `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `a` and `b` are mentioned in the description but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is the loop variable and it starts at 0, we don't need to set it manually before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
