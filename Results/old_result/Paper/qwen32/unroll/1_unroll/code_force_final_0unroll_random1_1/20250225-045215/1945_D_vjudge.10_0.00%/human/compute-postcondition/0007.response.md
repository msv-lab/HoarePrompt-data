Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m` â‰¤ `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each. For each test case, it computes a cost based on the values in lists `a` and `b` according to specific rules and prints the computed cost.**
