#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i. b is a list of n integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for each i. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    for c in custos:

    #State: The output state remains unchanged except that each integer in the list `custos` has been printed to the console, one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m` â‰¤ `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each. For each test case, it computes a cost based on the values in lists `a` and `b` according to specific rules and prints the computed cost.
