Output State: **For each of the `t` test cases, the program will print 'NO' if the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, otherwise it will print 'YES'. If 'YES' is printed, it will also print the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string `s`, depending on whether `s` is already in lexicographically smallest order or not. The values of `t`, `n`, and the initial strings `s` remain unchanged.**
