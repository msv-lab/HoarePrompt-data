You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

Let's analyze the given code and the problem statement to identify potential issues.

The problem requires calculating the minimum number of screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid. The code provided seems to have some logical flaws that can lead to incorrect results.

Let's break down the code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```
1. **Calculating `z`**: `z = (y + 1) // 2` — This line calculates the minimum number of screens required to place `y` 2x2 icons. This is because each screen can hold a maximum of 2 2x2 icons (since 2x2 icons take up 4 cells and the screen is 15 cells in total, 15/4 ≈ 3.75, so we can fit 2 2x2 icons per screen).
2. **Calculating `m`**: `m = 15 * z - y * 4` — This line calculates the remaining cells after placing `y` 2x2 icons. However, this calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the grid layout and how 1x1 icons can fill the remaining space.
3. **Adjusting `z` for 1x1 icons**: `if m < a: z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` — This line adjusts the number of screens based on the remaining cells and the number of 1x1 icons. However, the logic here is flawed because `m` is not correctly calculated, and the comparison `m < a` is incorrect (it should be related to the remaining cells, not the number of test cases `a`).

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `1 7 2`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `2`

Explanation for the test case:
- We have 7 1x1 icons and 2 2x2 icons.
- 2 2x2 icons take up 8 cells, leaving 7 cells available.
- The 7 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining 7 cells.
- Therefore, only 1 screen is needed.

However, the code will output `2` because of the incorrect calculation of `m` and the logic for adjusting `z`.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
