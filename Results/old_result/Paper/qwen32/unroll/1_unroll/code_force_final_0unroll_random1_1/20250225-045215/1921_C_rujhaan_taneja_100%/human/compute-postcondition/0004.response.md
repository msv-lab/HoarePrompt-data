Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `m` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the differences in the list `m` and compares it to `f`. It prints 'Yes' if the calculated sum plus a penalty term is less than `f`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The input values remain unchanged after processing each test case.**
