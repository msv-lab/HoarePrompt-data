The code snippet assigns the length of list `B` to the variable `r`. The length of list `B` is 4, as it contains four elements: [0, 1, 3, 6]. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 1, 3, 12], `idx_A` is [1, 2, 3, 6], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `l` is 0, `r` is 4**.
