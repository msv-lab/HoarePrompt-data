The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer result based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is greater than half of `n` rounded up, it performs a series of calculations involving `n` and `k` to derive the result. Otherwise, it directly computes the result as `2 * k - 1`.
