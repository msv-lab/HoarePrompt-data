The given code snippet reassigns the list `y` to a new list of size `n` with all elements set to `None`. This means that the original values of `y` (which were the coordinates of the center of the disks) are lost and replaced by this new list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `y` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `r` is a list of integers where `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk with 1 <= `r[i]` <= 10^9 for each i from 0 to n-1; `visited` and `coef` are lists of size `n` initialized to `False` and `None` respectively.**
