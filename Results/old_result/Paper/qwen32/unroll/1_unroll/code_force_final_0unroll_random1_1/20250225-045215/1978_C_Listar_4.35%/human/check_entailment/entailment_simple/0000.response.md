### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation and Constraints Handling**:
    - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
    - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
    - The function `func_2` checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `0, 0`, which leads to printing "NO" because an odd Manhattan value is impossible for any permutation.
    - The function `func_2` then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`. For odd `n`, `max_k` is `(n^2 - 1) / 2`, and for even `n`, `max_k` is `n^2 / 2`.
    - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, the function returns `0, 0`, leading to printing "NO" because `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.

2. **Generating the Permutation**:
    - If `k` is valid (`k` is even and `k <= max_k`), the function `func_1` generates a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k`.
    - The function `func_1` starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
    - It then iteratively modifies this permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k`. The modification involves moving elements to increase the Manhattan value by swapping elements with their positions.
    - The function `func_1` uses a loop to adjust the permutation based on the value of `k`. If `k` becomes zero, it returns the current permutation.

3. **Output**:
    - If a valid permutation is generated, the function `func_3` prints "YES" followed by the permutation.
    - If no valid permutation can be generated (either because `k` is odd or exceeds `max_k`), the function `func_4` prints "NO".

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the constraints and generates the permutation with the specified Manhattan value when possible. It ensures that:
- If `k` is odd, it outputs "NO".
- If `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`, it outputs "NO".
- If `k` is valid, it generates a permutation with the exact Manhattan value `k`.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.
