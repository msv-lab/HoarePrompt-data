You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people by bribing others. For each person `i` in the queue, there are two costs:
- `a_i`: The cost to directly swap positions with person `i`.
- `b_i`: The cost to bribe person `i` when moving past them to swap with someone else.

The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`. It then attempts to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

#### Issues in the Program:

1. **Logic for Swapping and Bribing:**
   - The program iterates from the last person in the queue to the `m`-th person, adding either `a_i` or `b_i` to the cost based on a comparison, which is incorrect.
   - It then iterates from the `m`-th person to the first, adding costs based on another comparison, which is also incorrect.
   - The logic does not correctly account for the cost of bribing multiple people to move past them.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Kirill needs to bribe multiple people to reach his desired position.
   - The program incorrectly adds costs based on comparisons that do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to use a priority queue (min-heap) to always choose the least costly option to move Kirill forward. Specifically:
- Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest `a_i` and `b_i` values.
- Iterate through the queue from the end to the `m`-th position, always choosing the least costly option to move Kirill forward.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
