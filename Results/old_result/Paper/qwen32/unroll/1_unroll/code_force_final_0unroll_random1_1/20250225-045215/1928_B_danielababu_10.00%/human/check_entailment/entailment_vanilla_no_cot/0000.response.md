Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not contain a function that solves the problem described. The code includes several utility functions for input and basic operations, but it does not contain the logic to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation. To solve the problem, one would need to implement a function that calculates the desired result based on the given constraints and logic.
