You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Understanding

The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The game is played multiple times as Eve removes one number from the sequence each time. Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins.

The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even. For the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, their binary representations are:
- 1: 001
- 2: 010
- 3: 011
- 4: 100

### Key Observations

1. **Odd Counts and XOR**:
   - If the count of any number (1, 2, 3, or 4) in the sequence is odd, it affects the XOR result.
   - Specifically, for the XOR to be zero, the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position must be even.

2. **Bob's Wins**:
   - Bob wins when the XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - If initially, the XOR of the sequence is zero, Bob wins the first round.
   - Eve can strategically remove numbers to ensure that the XOR remains zero for subsequent rounds.

3. **Count of Numbers**:
   - If the count of any number (1, 2, 3, or 4) is odd, Eve can remove it to make the count even.
   - If the count of a number is even, Eve can remove any other number to maintain the even count.

### Strategy for Eve

- **Initial XOR Check**:
  - Compute the XOR of the initial sequence.
  - If the XOR is zero, Bob wins the first round.
- **Removing Numbers**:
  - If the count of any number (1, 2, 3, or 4) is odd, Eve can remove it to make the count even.
  - If all counts are even, Eve can remove any number without affecting the parity of the counts.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- **Input Parsing**:
  - The input consists of the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` attempts to make all counts even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. This step is incorrect as it does not correctly handle the parity of the counts.

- **Odd Count Check**:
  - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` checks if the first three counts (1, 2, 3) have an odd count. This is not a correct way to determine if the XOR of the sequence is zero.
  
- **Bob's Wins Calculation**:
  - `sum(p) // 2` calculates the total number of numbers divided by 2, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The program incorrectly handles the parity of counts and does not correctly compute the XOR of the sequence.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
