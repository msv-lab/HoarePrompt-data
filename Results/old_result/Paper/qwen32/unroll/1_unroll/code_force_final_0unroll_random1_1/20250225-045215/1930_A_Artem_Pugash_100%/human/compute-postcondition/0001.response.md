The given code processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list and then sums up the first `n` elements (which are the smallest elements after sorting). The result of this summation is printed for each test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and does not retain any state between iterations, after all test cases have been processed, the variables `n`, `l`, and `score` will reflect the values from the last test case processed. However, since these variables are local to the loop body, they do not persist outside of it. The only variable that retains its state across all iterations is `t`, but its value is decremented in each iteration of the outer loop, eventually reaching 0 when all test cases are processed.

Therefore, after all iterations, the output state will only reflect that all test cases have been processed, and the variables `n`, `l`, and `score` will not be in a meaningful state outside the loop as they are local to each iteration.

Output State: **All test cases processed, variables n, l, and score are out of scope.**
