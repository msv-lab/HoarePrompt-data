The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with four integers n, f, a, and b, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. This is followed by n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}. The total number of messages across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
