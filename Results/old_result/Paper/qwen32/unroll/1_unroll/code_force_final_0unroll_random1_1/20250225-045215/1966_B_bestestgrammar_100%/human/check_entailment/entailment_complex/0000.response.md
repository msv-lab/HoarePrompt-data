### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing a series of operations. Each operation allows you to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that same color. 

The provided program checks if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by focusing on the colors of the corners and the edges of the grid. Specifically, it checks the following conditions:

1. If the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) squares are different, it then checks if all squares in the first row are the same and all squares in the last row are the same. Similarly, it checks if all squares in the first column are the same and all squares in the last column are the same.
2. If any of these checks fail, it concludes that it is impossible to make all squares the same color and outputs "NO".
3. If the top-left and bottom-right squares are the same, it outputs "YES" without further checks.

However, this logic is flawed. The program does not correctly account for all possible configurations of the grid. For example, consider a grid where the top-left and bottom-right squares are the same, but there are other squares in the grid that prevent the entire grid from being painted the same color. The program would incorrectly output "YES" in such cases.

Let's consider a counterexample:
```
3 3
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
In this grid, the top-left and bottom-right squares are both 'W'. However, it is impossible to make all squares the same color because there is no way to change the 'B' squares to 'W' without also changing other 'W' squares to 'B' in the process.

Thus, the program's logic is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color for all possible grid configurations.

### Correctness:
**False**
