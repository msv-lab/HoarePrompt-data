You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The diagonals include both the main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left) and the off-diagonals.

### Key Observations:
1. **Main Diagonals**: There are two main diagonals in any \( n \times n \) grid.
2. **Off-Diagonals**: There are \( 2n - 2 \) off-diagonals in total (each main diagonal contributes to \( n - 1 \) off-diagonals on either side).
3. **Total Diagonals**: The total number of diagonals is \( 4n - 2 \).

### Strategy:
1. **If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \)**: We can cover the diagonals by coloring cells such that each cell covers two diagonals (one main and one off-diagonal). Thus, the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
2. **If \( k = 4n - 3 \)**: This means we need to cover all diagonals except one. The optimal strategy is to color \( 2n - 1 \) cells, which will cover all but one diagonal.
3. **If \( k = 4n - 2 \)**: This means we need to cover all diagonals. The optimal strategy is to color \( 2n \) cells, which will cover all diagonals.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program handles the three cases as described:
- **Case 1**: If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), it computes \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- **Case 2**: If \( k = 4n - 3 \), it outputs \( 2n - 1 \).
- **Case 3**: If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it outputs \( 2n \).

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
- **Example 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \) → \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \) (correct)
- **Example 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \) → \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \) (correct)
- **Example 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \) → \( 2n - 1 = 5 \) (incorrect, should be 6)
- **Example 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \) → \( 2n - 1 = 5 \) (correct)
- **Example 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \) → \( \lceil \frac{7}{2} \rceil = 4 \) (correct)
- **Example 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \) → \( \lceil \frac{11}{2} \rceil = 6 \) (correct)
- **Example 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \) → \( 2n - 1 = 3 \) (incorrect, should be 2)

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where \( k \) is between \( 4n - 4 \) and \( 4n - 3 \) correctly. Specifically, it should handle the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 5 \) or \( 4n - 6 \) appropriately, which it does not.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
