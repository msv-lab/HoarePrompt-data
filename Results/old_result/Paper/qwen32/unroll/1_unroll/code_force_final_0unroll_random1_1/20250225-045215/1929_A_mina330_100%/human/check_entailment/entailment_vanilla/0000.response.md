### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

The best way to do this is to sort the array. When the array is sorted, the difference between consecutive elements will be maximized because the smallest element will be at the start and the largest element will be at the end. Thus, the maximum beauty will be the difference between the largest and the smallest element in the sorted array.

Let's analyze the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (ntest).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (n) and the elements of the array (a).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array is sorted using the `sort()` method.

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The beauty is calculated as the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, which is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The calculated beauty for each test case is printed.

This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can indeed be achieved by sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This ensures that the sum of differences between consecutive elements is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
