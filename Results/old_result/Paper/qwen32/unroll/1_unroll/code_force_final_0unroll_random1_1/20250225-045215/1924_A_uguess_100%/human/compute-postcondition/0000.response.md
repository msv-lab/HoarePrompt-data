Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, while the conditions and constraints for `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.
