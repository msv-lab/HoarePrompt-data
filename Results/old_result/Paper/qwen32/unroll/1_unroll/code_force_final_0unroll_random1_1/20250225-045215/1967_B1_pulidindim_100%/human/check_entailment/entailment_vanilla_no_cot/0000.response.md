Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic within the function is incorrect and does not accurately count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not properly handled in the given code. The program incorrectly initializes `count` to 2 and iterates through values of `b` while calculating the number of valid `a` values, but it does not correctly account for all valid pairs (a, b) for each test case.

Here is a more correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, calculate the number of valid `a` values such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
3. Use the property of gcd to simplify the condition and count valid `a` values efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

However, the above solution is not efficient enough for the given constraints (n, m up to 2 * 10^6). A more efficient approach involves mathematical insights to count the pairs without iterating through all possible pairs (a, b).

Here is an optimized version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            g = math.gcd(b, n)
            k = n // g
            ans += k // b + (1 if k % b != 0 else 0)
        print(ans)

func()
```

This optimized version efficiently counts the number of valid pairs (a, b) by leveraging the properties of gcd and integer division.
