To determine the output state, we need to consider the execution of the function `func_2(0, 1)`. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided in the initial state. Without knowing what `func_2` does, we can only assume that it does not modify the variable `n` directly, as `n` is not passed as an argument to the function and there is no indication that `func_2` has side effects that would alter `n`.

Given this assumption, the only thing that changes is the call to `func_2(0, 1)`. Since there is no effect on `n` and no other variables are mentioned, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the function call itself.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, and the current value of `n` is 2. The function `func_2(0, 1)` has been called.**
