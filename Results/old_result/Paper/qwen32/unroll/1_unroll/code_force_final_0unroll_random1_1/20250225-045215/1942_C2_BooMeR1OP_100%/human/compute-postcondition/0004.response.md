Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` that is determined by the gaps between the integers in the list and the value of `y`. The function does not modify the input values but uses them to compute and output a result for each test case.**
