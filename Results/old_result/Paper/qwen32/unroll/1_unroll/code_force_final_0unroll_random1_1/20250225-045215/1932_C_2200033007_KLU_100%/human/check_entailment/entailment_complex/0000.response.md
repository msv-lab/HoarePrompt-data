Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The main issue lies in the way the cumulative product is calculated and the order in which the results are stored and returned.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the errors:

1. **Incorrect Selection of Elements for Product Calculation:**
   - The program first creates a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands 'L' and 'R'. However, the problem requires calculating the product of all remaining elements in `a` at each step before removing an element based on the command.

2. **Cumulative Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order. This does not correspond to the problem's requirement to calculate the product of all elements remaining in `a` at each step.

3. **Output Order:**
   - The program returns the cumulative products in the reverse order, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for the product of all remaining elements in `a` at each step in the order the commands are processed.

To correct the program, we need to:

- Calculate the product of all elements in `a` initially.
- For each command, output the current product modulo `m`, then remove the appropriate element from `a` and update the product accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    # Calculate the initial product of all elements in a modulo m
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        ans.append(product)
        
        if command == 'L':
            # Remove the leftmost element and update the product
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # modular multiplicative inverse
            l += 1
        else:
            # Remove the rightmost element and update the product
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # modular multiplicative inverse
            r -= 1
    
    return ans
```

This corrected function calculates the product of all elements in `a` initially and then updates the product by removing the appropriate element for each command using the modular multiplicative inverse to efficiently divide the product by the removed element.

Correctness: **False**
