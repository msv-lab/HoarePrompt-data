### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic step-by-step and compare it to the problem description.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by taking the set of distinct characters from `b` and sorting them alphabetically.
   - It then creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character from the end of `r`.
   - Finally, it constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary.

3. **Validation**:
   - The decoding process correctly reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement.
   - The auxiliary string `r` is constructed as required, and the mapping dictionary correctly maps each character to its symmetric counterpart.
   - The final string `s` is constructed by applying the mapping to each character in the encoded string `b`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify the first example provided:
     - Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`
     - Distinct characters in alphabetical order: `r = "cdefors"`
     - Mapping: `{'c': 's', 'd': 'r', 'e': 'o', 'f': 'f', 'o': 'e', 'r': 'd', 's': 'c'}`
     - Decoding `b` using the mapping results in `s = "codeforces"`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm by constructing the auxiliary string `r` and using a mapping dictionary to reverse the encoding process. It handles multiple test cases and produces the expected output.
Correctness: **True**
