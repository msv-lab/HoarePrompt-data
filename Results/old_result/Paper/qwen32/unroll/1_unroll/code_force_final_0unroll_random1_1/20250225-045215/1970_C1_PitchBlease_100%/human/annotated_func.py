#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v (1 <= u, v <= n), and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed (1 <= start <= n).
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v (1 <= u, v <= n), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed (1 <= start <= n), and `tree` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes.`
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the structure of a tree and the distances from a starting node to two leaf nodes. It accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of edges represented as tuples), and `start` (the starting node). The function returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances from the starting node to any two leaf nodes is odd, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.
