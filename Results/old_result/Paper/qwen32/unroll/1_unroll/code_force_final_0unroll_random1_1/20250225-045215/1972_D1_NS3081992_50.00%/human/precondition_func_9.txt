The function does not have any parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. However, based on the context, it is implied that this function is expected to read an integer input, which likely represents the number of test cases (t) for the problem. Therefore, the precondition can be described as: the input to this function should be a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
