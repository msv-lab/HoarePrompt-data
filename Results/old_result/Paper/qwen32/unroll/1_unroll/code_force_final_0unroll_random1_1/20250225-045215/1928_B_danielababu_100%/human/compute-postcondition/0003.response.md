To determine the output state, let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables `arr`, `ans`, and `tem`.

The loop iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element and moving to the first. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of `tem` by the current element of `arr` and appends the result to `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `tem` is 1.

Let's assume `arr` has some values, say `arr = [a, b, c]` for simplicity. The loop will execute as follows:

1. **First Iteration (i = 2)**:
   - `tem *= arr[2]` → `tem = 1 * c = c`
   - `ans.append(tem)` → `ans = [c]`

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
   - `tem *= arr[1]` → `tem = c * b = cb`
   - `ans.append(tem)` → `ans = [c, cb]`

3. **Third Iteration (i = 0)**:
   - `tem *= arr[0]` → `tem = cb * a = cba`
   - `ans.append(tem)` → `ans = [c, cb, cba]`

After the loop completes, the final state of the variables will be:
- `arr` remains unchanged as `[a, b, c]`.
- `ans` will be `[c, cb, cba]`.
- `tem` will be the product of all elements in `arr`, which is `cba`.

In natural language, the output state means that `ans` will contain the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element, and `tem` will hold the product of all elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` in reverse order; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.**
