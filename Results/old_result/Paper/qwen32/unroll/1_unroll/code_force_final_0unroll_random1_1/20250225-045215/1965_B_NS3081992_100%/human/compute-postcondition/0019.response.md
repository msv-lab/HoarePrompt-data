To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i`, `lk`, and `l`. The loop will execute if `lk` is less than `l`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lk` is less than `l`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains `i`, `lk`, and `l`. The loop will iterate over the range from `lk` to `l`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `lk` is less than `l`. If `lk` is equal to or greater than `l`, the loop will not execute.
3. **Adjusting the State**: We need to ensure that `lk` is less than `l`. Since `lk` and `l` are determined by the lengths of the binary representations of `k` and `n` respectively, we need to adjust the values of `n` and `k` accordingly.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`.
- `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` is the length of the binary string `b`.
- `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
- `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`.
- `ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(l-1), k - 2^l, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need `lk < l`. This means the binary representation of `k` should be shorter than the binary representation of `n`.

**State**: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()` such that the length of the binary representation of `k` (lk) is less than the length of the binary representation of `n` (l), `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, `ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(l-1), k - 2^l, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`**.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are determined by `func_7()`, we cannot specify exact numeric values, but we can ensure that `lk < l` by appropriately choosing `n` and `k` such that the binary length of `k` is less than the binary length of `n`.
