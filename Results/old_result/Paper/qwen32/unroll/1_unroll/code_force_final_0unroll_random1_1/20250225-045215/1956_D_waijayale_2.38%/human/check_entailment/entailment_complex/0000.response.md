### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of four functions, and we need to determine if they collectively meet the problem description. Let's analyze each function in the context of the problem:

1. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - This function is supposed to modify the array `a` within the range `[l, r]` by setting elements to a specific value if they do not meet a condition.
   - It recursively calls itself to process the subarray `[l+1, r]`.
   - If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - The function does not return any value but modifies `a` and `ops` in place.

2. **Function 2: `func_2`**
   - This function is supposed to maximize the sum of the array `a` and return the sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - It calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the full range of the array `[0, n-1]`.
   - However, it does not pass `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum`, which means that `ops` will remain empty, and the function will always return `0` for the number of operations.
   - The function returns the sum of `a`, `0`, and an empty list `ops`.

3. **Function 3: `func_3`**
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the sum and operations, prints the sum and the number of operations, and then prints each operation.
   - Since `func_2` always returns `0` for the number of operations and an empty list `ops`, `func_3` will always print `0` for the number of operations and will not print any operations.

4. **Function 4: `recursive_maximize_sum`**
   - This function is supposed to recursively modify the array `a` to maximize its sum.
   - If the sum of the elements in the subarray `[l, r]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it sets all elements in that subarray to the length of the subarray.
   - Otherwise, it recursively processes subarrays divided by the maximum element's position within the current range.
   - The function appends operations to `ops` when modifying the array.

### Issues:
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)** does not correctly pass the `ops` list to `recursive_maximize_sum`. This means that `ops` will not be populated correctly, and `func_2` will always return `0` for the number of operations and an empty list `ops`.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)** will always print `0` for the number of operations and will not print any operations because `func_2` does not provide the correct `ops`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly track and return the operations performed on the array. The function `func_2` does not pass the `ops` list to `recursive_maximize_sum`, resulting in an incorrect number of operations and no operations being printed.

**Correctness: False**
