### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether the sequence generated by `func_14` meets the problem's requirements for all possible inputs.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **No Subsequence Sum Equals \( k \)**: There should be no combination of elements in the sequence that sums up to \( k \).
2. **Subsequence Sum for All \( v \) (1 ≤ \( v \) ≤ \( n \) and \( v \neq k \))**: For every integer \( v \) within the range [1, \( n \)] except \( k \), there must exist a subsequence of the sequence that sums up to \( v \).

#### Analysis of `func_14`:

**Case 1: \( k = 1 \)**

- If \( n = 2 \), the function returns the sequence `[2]`. This is correct because there is no subsequence that sums to 1, and the only possible sum is 2.
- Otherwise, the function generates a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to \( 2^{l-1} \), where \( l \) is the number of bits in the binary representation of \( n \).

**Case 2: \( k \neq 1 \)**

- The function generates a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to \( 2^{lk-1} \), where \( lk \) is the number of bits in the binary representation of \( k \).
- It then appends `k - 1 - sum([2^i for i in range(lk - 1)])`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
- Finally, it appends further powers of 2 up to \( 2^{l-1} \).

Let's verify if these sequences satisfy the problem requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Sum Equals \( k \)**:
   - For \( k = 1 \), the sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^{l-1}]` cannot sum to 1 because all elements are greater than 1.
   - For \( k \neq 1 \), the inclusion of `k - 1 - sum([2^i for i in range(lk - 1)])` ensures that no combination of the initial powers of 2 can sum to \( k \). The additional elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` also prevent any subsequence from summing to \( k \).

2. **Subsequence Sum for All \( v \) (1 ≤ \( v \) ≤ \( n \) and \( v \neq k \))**:
   - For \( k = 1 \), the sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^{l-1}]` can generate all sums from 2 to \( 2^{l-1} + 2^{l-2} + \ldots + 2 + 1 = 2^l - 1 \) (which is greater than or equal to \( n \) since \( l \) is the number of bits in \( n \)).
   - For \( k \neq 1 \), the initial powers of 2 can generate all sums from 1 to \( 2^{lk-1} - 1 \). The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum([2^i for i in range(lk - 1)])` ensures that we can generate sums up to \( k - 1 \). The elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` help generate sums greater than \( k \). The final powers of 2 ensure that we can generate sums up to \( 2^{l-1} + 2^{l-2} + \ldots + 2 + 1 = 2^l - 1 \).

Given the above analysis, the sequences generated by `func_14` appear to meet the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct as it generates sequences that satisfy both conditions for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
