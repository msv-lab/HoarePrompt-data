To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the given loop and how it modifies the `mex`, `minn`, and `used` variables based on the input array `arr`.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is an empty list.
   - `minn` is 0.
   - `used` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `arr`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
       - Append `minn` to `mex`.
       - Mark `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary.
       - Increment `minn` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
       - Calculate `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and append it to `mex`.
       - Mark `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as used in the `used` dictionary.

### Output State Explanation

By the end of the loop, the `mex` list will contain `n` elements, each determined by the value of `arr[i]` and the current state of `minn` and `used`. The `minn` variable will be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `mex`, and the `used` dictionary will contain all the integers that have been added to `mex`.

### Output State Format

Given the format requirements, the output state will be described in terms of the final values of `mex`, `minn`, and `used`.

**Output State:**
- `mex` will be a list of `n` elements, each calculated based on the logic described above.
- `minn` will be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `mex`.
- `used` will be a dictionary containing all the integers that have been added to `mex`.

Since the exact values in `mex` depend on the input array `arr`, we cannot specify the exact list of values. However, we can describe the state in a general format.

### Final Output State

Output State: **mex: [calculated values based on arr], minn: smallest unused non-negative integer, used: {dict of used integers}**.

Given the input constraints and the loop logic, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **mex: [calculated values based on arr], minn: smallest unused non-negative integer, used: {dict of used integers}**.
