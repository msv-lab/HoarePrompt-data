### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the program step-by-step.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`. It then reads the list `a` and `b` and converts them into lists of integers. The program also initializes `a` and `b` with a leading `0` to simplify indexing.

2. **Distance and Time Differences**:
   - `ad` is a list that stores the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, representing the distances between the signs.
   - `bd` is a list that stores the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, representing the time intervals between reaching each sign.
   
3. **Speed Calculation**:
   - `v` is a list that stores the speeds between each pair of consecutive signs. The speed is calculated as the distance divided by the time interval.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the position `s` in the list `a` where `ql` would fit in the sorted order.
   - If `ql` is exactly at a sign (i.e., `a[s] == ql`), the program directly returns the corresponding time `b[s]`.
   - If `ql` is not at a sign, the program calculates the time taken to reach `ql` from the previous sign. This is done by adding the time taken to reach the previous sign `b[s - 1]` and the additional time to travel the remaining distance `(ql - a[s - 1])` at the speed `v[s]`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the results of each query on the same line, separated by spaces, and moves to the next line after processing all queries for the current test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It handles the calculation of speeds and the time taken for each query accurately. The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the correct segment of the journey is considered for each query. The program also handles edge cases, such as queries at the exact points where the car reaches a sign.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
