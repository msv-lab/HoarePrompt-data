To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to understand the problem requirements and the functionality of the provided functions.

### Problem Breakdown

The task is to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. The prefix maximums are the elements in the permutation that are the maximum of all previous elements, and the suffix maximums are the elements that are the maximum of all subsequent elements. The result should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Provided Functions

1. **func_1(a, b)**:
   - This function seems to compute the coefficients of the Bezout's identity, i.e., it finds integers \(c\) and \(d\) such that \(ac + bd = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - It uses a recursive approach to compute these coefficients, which is a standard method for this problem.

2. **func_2(a, b)**:
   - This function computes the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a`, taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It uses `func_1` to find the modular inverse.

### Analysis

The problem requires combinatorial counting, specifically the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions. The provided functions are related to modular arithmetic, which is necessary for computing the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, the provided code does not include any logic to count the permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums. It only provides functions for modular arithmetic, which are useful but not sufficient for solving the problem.

### Correctness

Given the problem requirements and the provided functions, the program is incomplete. It lacks the core logic to count the valid permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums. The provided functions are only auxiliary and do not address the main task of counting permutations.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
