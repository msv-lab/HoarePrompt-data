Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a` is a list containing `na` numbers from `numbers`, `group_b` is a list containing `nb` numbers from `numbers`, and `group_c` is a list containing `nc` numbers from `numbers`; `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`. Additionally, `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is false.**
