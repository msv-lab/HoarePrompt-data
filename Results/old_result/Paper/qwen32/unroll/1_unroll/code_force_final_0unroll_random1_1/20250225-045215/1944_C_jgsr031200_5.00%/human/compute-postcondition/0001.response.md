The code snippet provided initializes the variable `start` to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the counts of each integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the counts of each integer in `arr`; `start` is 0.**
