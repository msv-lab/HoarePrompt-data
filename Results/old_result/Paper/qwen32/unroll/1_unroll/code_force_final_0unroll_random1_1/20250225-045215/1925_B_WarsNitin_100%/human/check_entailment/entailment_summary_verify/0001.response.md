To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the program step-by-step using the provided function summary and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the maximum possible GCD of a set of `n` positive integers that sum up to `x`. The GCD is maximized if the integers can be chosen such that they are all multiples of the same number `d`, and the sum of these multiples equals `x`.

### Key Observations

1. **Divisibility Check**: For a number `d` to be a possible GCD, `x` must be divisible by `d`. This ensures that `x` can be partitioned into multiples of `d`.

2. **Feasibility Check**: Once `d` divides `x`, we need to check if we can partition `x` into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `d`. This translates to checking if `(x / d) - n` is non-negative and divisible by `d`.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Divisors**: To find the maximum possible GCD, we should iterate over all possible divisors of `x` and check the above conditions.

### Program Analysis

The provided program does the following:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.

2. **Finding Maximum GCD**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - It iterates over all numbers from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive) to find divisors of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
     - It then checks if `(x - n * i) >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - Similarly, it checks for the complement divisor `x // i` (if `x // i > 0`), and updates `ans` if the conditions are satisfied.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the logic and correctness of the program using the function summary:

- **Divisor Check**: The program correctly checks for divisors of `x` by iterating up to the square root of `x`. This ensures that all divisors are considered efficiently.
- **Feasibility Check**: For each divisor `i`, the program checks if `(x - n * i) >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. This ensures that the remaining value after partitioning can be evenly distributed into `n` parts, each being a multiple of `i`.
- **Complement Divisor Check**: The program also checks for the complement divisor `x // i`, ensuring that all possible divisors are considered.
- **Updating Maximum GCD**: The program updates `ans` to the maximum value found, ensuring that the maximum possible GCD is returned.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - For `i = 1`: `(10 - 3*1) % 1 == 0` → Feasible, `ans = 1`
   - For `i = 2`: `(10 - 3*2) % 2 == 0` → Feasible, `ans = 2`
   - For `i = 5`: `(10 - 3*5) % 5 != 0` → Not feasible
   - For `i = 10`: `(10 - 3*10) < 0` → Not feasible
   - Maximum GCD: `2`

2. **Test Case 2**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
   - For `i = 1`: `(5 - 5*1) % 1 == 0` → Feasible, `ans = 1`
   - For `i = 5`: `(5 - 5*5) < 0` → Not feasible
   - Maximum GCD: `1`

3. **Test Case 3**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
   - For `i = 6`: `(420 - 69*6) % 6 == 0` → Feasible, `ans = 6`
   - Maximum GCD: `6`

The program correctly computes the maximum GCD for the given examples.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis and verification, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible GCD of the sub-problems.
