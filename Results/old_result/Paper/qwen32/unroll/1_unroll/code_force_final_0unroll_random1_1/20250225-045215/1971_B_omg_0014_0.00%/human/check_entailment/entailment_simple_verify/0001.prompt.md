You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the program will print 'NO' if the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, otherwise it will print 'YES'. If 'YES' is printed, it will also print the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string `s`, depending on whether `s` is already in lexicographically smallest order or not. The values of `t`, `n`, and the initial strings `s` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` into a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If it's not possible to do so, the program should output "NO". Otherwise, it should output "YES" followed by one possible rearrangement of `s`.

### Program Analysis

The program takes the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the string `s`.
3. It creates a set `a` from the characters of `s` to determine the number of unique characters.
4. If the number of unique characters in `s` is 2, it outputs "NO" because any rearrangement of a string with only two distinct characters will either be the same as the original string or its reverse, which means it's impossible to create a different string.
5. If the number of unique characters is more than 2, it outputs "YES" and then proceeds to find a rearrangement:
   - It sorts the string `s` in ascending order and stores it in `b`.
   - It sorts the string `s` in descending order and stores it in `c`.
   - If `b` (the ascending order) is the same as the original string `s`, it prints `c` (the descending order).
   - Otherwise, it prints `b` (the ascending order).

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling Strings with Two Unique Characters**:
   - The program correctly identifies strings with only two unique characters and outputs "NO" because any rearrangement would either be the same as the original string or its reverse.
   
2. **Handling Strings with More Than Two Unique Characters**:
   - The program correctly identifies strings with more than two unique characters and outputs "YES".
   - It then tries to find a rearrangement by sorting the string in both ascending and descending order.
   - If the ascending order is the same as the original string, it outputs the descending order, ensuring a different string.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the ascending order, which will be different from the original string.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a rearrangement is possible and outputs the correct results based on the problem description.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
