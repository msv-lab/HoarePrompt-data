Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the smallest `n` integers from the list and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no variables from the test cases remaining in scope.**
