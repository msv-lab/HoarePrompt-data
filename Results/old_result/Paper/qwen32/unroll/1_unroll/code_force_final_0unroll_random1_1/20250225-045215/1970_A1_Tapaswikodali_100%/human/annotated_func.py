#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix of a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of a character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix of a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of a character in the input sequence. Additionally, the balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each with attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and `infoB` if their balances are not equal. If their balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and `infoA`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and the string represents a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and the string represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance at each index `i` of `s` and the character at that index; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the string formed by joining the `character` attributes of `balance_info` objects in the specified order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a balanced parentheses sequence. It prints a string formed by rearranging the characters of `s` based on the balance and position of each parenthesis, sorted first by balance and then by the negative position. The function does not return any value.
