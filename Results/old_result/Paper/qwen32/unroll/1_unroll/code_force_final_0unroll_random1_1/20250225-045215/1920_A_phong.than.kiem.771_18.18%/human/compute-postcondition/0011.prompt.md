You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether the input line should be split into items based on spaces, to_int is a boolean indicating whether the items should be converted to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `space` is a boolean, `to_int` is a boolean, `line` is a string. If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by spaces. If `space` is `False`, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in `items`. If `space` is `True`, `items` consists of substrings split by spaces from `line`, and if `space` is `False`, `items` consists of individual characters from `line`. Each substring or character in `items` must be convertible to an integer for the conversion to succeed.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns `items`, which is a list of substrings from `line` split by spaces if `space` is `True`, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. If `to_int` is `True`, it returns a list of integers derived from `line`, where `line` is split into items based on spaces if `space` is `True`, or into individual characters if `space` is `False`. If `to_int` is `False`, it returns a list of substrings from `line` split by spaces if `space` is `True`, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is `False`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in `items`. If `space` is `True`, `items` consists of substrings split by spaces from `line`, and if `space` is `False`, `items` consists of individual characters from `line`. Each substring or character in `items` must be convertible to an integer for the conversion to succeed.

Case_2: The program returns `items`, which is a list of substrings from `line` split by spaces if `space` is `True`, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is `False`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
