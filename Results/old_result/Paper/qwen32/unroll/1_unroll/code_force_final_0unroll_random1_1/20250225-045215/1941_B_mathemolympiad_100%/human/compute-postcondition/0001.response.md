The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use) and `numTest`. The loop will execute if `numTest` is at least 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) are defined within the loop body and do not affect whether the loop starts or not.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `numTest` must be greater than or equal to 1. The other variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`numTest` must be greater than or equal to 1**
