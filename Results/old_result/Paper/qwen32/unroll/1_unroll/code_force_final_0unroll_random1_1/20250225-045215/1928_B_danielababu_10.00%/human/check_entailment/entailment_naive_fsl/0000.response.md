Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the solution to the problem described. The given functions (`func_1` to `func_9`) are utility functions that perform various operations such as reading input, mapping integers, and computing cumulative products. However, none of these functions address the core problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation.

To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array itself.
3. Determine the maximum frequency of any number that can be achieved by adding a permutation to the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
from collections import Counter

def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each element in the array
        count = Counter(a)
        
        # The maximum possible value after adding a permutation is the maximum element in the array + n
        max_possible_value = max(a) + n
        
        # Create a frequency counter for the possible sums
        freq = Counter()
        
        # For each unique element in the array, calculate the possible sums
        for num, cnt in count.items():
            for i in range(cnt):
                freq[num + i + 1] += 1
        
        # The result is the maximum frequency in the freq counter
        result = max(freq.values())
        
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to read input and print the results
solve()
```

This program reads the input, calculates the possible sums after adding a permutation, and determines the maximum frequency of any number in the resulting array. The provided code does not perform these necessary steps, hence it is incorrect.
