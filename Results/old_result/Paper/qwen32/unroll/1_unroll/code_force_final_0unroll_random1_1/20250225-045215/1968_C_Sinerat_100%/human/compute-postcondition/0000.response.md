In the given task, the loop is controlled by the variable `t` which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer satisfying `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The variables `n` and `x` are defined inside the loop and do not affect the execution of the outer loop.

Given that the only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common convention for a throwaway variable that we don't use inside the loop), and it is controlled by `int(input())`, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop executes the correct number of times.

Since the state before the loop starts already specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, no further adjustment is needed for `t` itself. However, we should ensure that the input function will provide an integer value for `t` that falls within this range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
