Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the maximum final score by performing a series of moves where in each move, two integers are chosen, the smaller one is added to the score, and both are removed from the board. The optimal strategy to achieve this is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This is because, by doing so, we ensure that we are adding the smallest possible values to the score in each move, thereby maximizing the number of times we can add the smallest values.

The provided program follows this optimal strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It initializes the score to 0.
5. It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (which are the smallest elements due to the sorting) and adds them to the score.
6. It prints the final score for each test case.

Since the program sorts the list and then adds every second element (which are the smallest elements in each pair), it correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
