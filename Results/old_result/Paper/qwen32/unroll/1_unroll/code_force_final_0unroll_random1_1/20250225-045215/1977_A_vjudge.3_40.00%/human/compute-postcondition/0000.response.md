Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input by the user, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The other part of the initial state, which describes the following `t` lines of input, remains unchanged as it has not been processed yet.
