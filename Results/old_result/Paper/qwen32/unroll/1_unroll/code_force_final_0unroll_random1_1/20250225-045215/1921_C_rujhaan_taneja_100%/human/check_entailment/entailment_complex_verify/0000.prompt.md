You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

    #State: For each test case, the code prints either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition that if the sum of the calculated values in `array2` plus the product of the difference between `n` and the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and the input values for each test case remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `m` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the differences in the list `m` and compares it to `f`. It prints 'Yes' if the calculated sum plus a penalty term is less than `f`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The input values remain unchanged after processing each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Handling the Initial Turn On and Off:**
   - The code does not consider the energy consumption when turning the phone on at the initial moment (0). According to the problem, the phone is already on at moment 0, so there is no initial energy cost for turning it on. However, the code does not account for this properly.

2. **Energy Consumption Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the energy consumption between messages but does not correctly account for the energy cost of turning the phone on and off.
   - The logic for calculating the energy consumption between messages is flawed. The code only adds the energy consumption if the time difference between messages is less than `b / a`, which is incorrect. The energy consumption should be calculated based on the actual time difference and the energy cost of turning the phone on and off.

3. **Summing Up the Energy Consumption:**
   - The code sums up the energy consumption between messages and adds the energy cost of turning the phone on and off for the remaining messages. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the initial state of the phone and the correct energy consumption for each operation.

4. **Comparison with Initial Charge:**
   - The code compares the total energy consumption with the initial charge `f`. However, the calculation of the total energy consumption is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Here's a counterexample where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
3 10 1 2
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initially, the phone has 10 units of charge.
- At time 0, the phone is already on.
- To send a message at time 1, no energy is spent because the phone is already on.
- To send a message at time 2, 1 unit of energy is spent (time difference 1).
- To send a message at time 3, 1 unit of energy is spent (time difference 1).
- Total energy spent: 1 + 1 = 2 units.
- Remaining charge: 10 - 2 = 8 units.
- Since the remaining charge is positive, Stepan can send all the messages.

**Program Output:**
```
No
```

The program incorrectly calculates the energy consumption and determines that Stepan cannot send all the messages. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Thus, Correctness: **False**.
