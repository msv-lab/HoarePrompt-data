### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have, where the winner is decided by the parity (odd or even) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. The key insight is that if the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins. This is because the game can be reduced to a simple parity check due to the optimal play strategy of both players.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function takes two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.
   - It calculates the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner and appends the result to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins, which aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the entire program is correct.
