Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It reads the list `a` and `b` and initializes auxiliary lists `ad`, `bd`, and `v` to store the differences and speeds between points.

2. **Calculating the Speeds**:
   - The program calculates the distance `ad[i]` and time `bd[i]` between each pair of consecutive points.
   - It then calculates the speed `v[i]` between each pair of consecutive points.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which the query point `ql` lies.
   - If `ql` is exactly at a point in the list `a`, it directly returns the corresponding time in `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by summing the time taken to reach the previous point and the additional time to reach `ql` from that point, based on the speed.

### Potential Issues:
- **Precision**: The program uses floating-point division to calculate the speed and the additional time. While this should be sufficient for the given constraints, it's worth noting that floating-point arithmetic can introduce small inaccuracies.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `ql` is exactly at a known point and when `ql` is at the start or end of the number line. However, the code assumes that `ql` is always within the range `[0, n]` as per the problem constraints, so this should not be an issue.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input parsing, speed calculation, and query processing as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
