### Reasoning:

The provided Python function is designed to solve the problem as described. It uses a sliding window technique to efficiently count the number of good subarrays of length `m` in the array `a` for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_val` is set to 1,000,000 to accommodate the maximum possible value of elements in arrays `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1,000,000).
   - `cnt_b` is an array of size `max_val + 1` initialized to zeros. This array will be used to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It counts the occurrences of each element in `b` using the `cnt_b` array.
   - `b_values` is a set of elements in `b` to quickly check if an element in `a` is part of `b`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - It initializes the count of matching elements `curr` for the first window of length `m` in `a`.
   - It then slides the window one element at a time from left to right:
     - If the element that is sliding out of the window was part of `b` and its count in `cnt_b` was positive, it decrements `curr`.
     - If the element that is sliding into the window is part of `b`, it decrements its count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
     - If `curr` (the number of matching elements in the current window) is at least `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, it prints the number of good subarrays found.

5. **Resetting for Next Test Case**:
   - It resets the `cnt_b` array for the next test case by setting the counts of elements in `b_values` back to zero.

### Correctness:
The function correctly implements the sliding window technique to efficiently count the number of good subarrays. It correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the provided program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
