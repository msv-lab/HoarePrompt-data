The function does not have any parameters, implying that it does not directly contribute to the solution based on the provided signature. However, if we consider the context, it seems to be a placeholder function that might be intended to take input. If we were to hypothesize based on the problem description and typical input handling, a more fitting signature might include parameters for n and k. Assuming such a signature, it would be: def func_9(n, k): where n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
