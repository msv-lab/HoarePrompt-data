Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, based on the periodicities of each sign and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially. The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

Let's break down the program's logic:
1. It processes each test case individually.
2. For each sign, it calculates the next possible occurrence year after the current year.
3. If the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity (`ai`), the next occurrence will be exactly `ai` years later.
4. If the current year is not a multiple of `ai`, it calculates the next occurrence year as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current year.
5. It updates the current year to the calculated next year and continues this process for all signs in the test case.
6. It stores the result for each test case in a list and prints them.

The logic correctly implements the problem's requirement that the signs must occur sequentially, and it accurately calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence based on the given periodicities.

Given the example provided in the problem statement, the program's output matches the expected results, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
