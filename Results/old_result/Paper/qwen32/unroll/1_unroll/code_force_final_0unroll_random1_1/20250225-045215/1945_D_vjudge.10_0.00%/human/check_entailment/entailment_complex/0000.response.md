### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the problem and the code to identify the issues.

#### Problem Breakdown:
Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue with the minimum cost. The cost to move from position `i` to position `j` involves paying `a_j` to the person at position `j` and `b_k` to each person `k` in between `j` and `i`. The goal is to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The code initializes `custo` to 0, which will store the total cost for each test case.
   - The code then iterates over the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements. This loop seems to be trying to calculate the cost to move Kirill from the end of the queue to position `m`, but it does so in a way that doesn't account for the cost of moving past multiple people.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed:
     - If `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo`. This doesn't make sense because `a_values[y]` is the cost to swap with the person at position `y`, not the cost to move past them.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo`. This is also incorrect because `b_values[y]` is the cost to move past the person at position `y`, not the cost to swap with them.
   - The next loop is also incorrect and doesn't properly account for the cost to move Kirill to the desired position while minimizing the total cost.

3. **Output:**
   - The code prints the computed cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the provided code is fundamentally flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The approach needs to be revised to correctly implement the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
