t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. grids is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, m, grid), with n and m being integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, and grid being a list of n strings, each of length m, consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
