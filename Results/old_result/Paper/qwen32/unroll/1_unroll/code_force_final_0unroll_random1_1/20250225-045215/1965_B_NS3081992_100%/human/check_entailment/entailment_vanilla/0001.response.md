Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Input Reading**: The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases and `func_14()` to process each test case. `func_14()` reads two integers `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Binary Representation**: The program converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations (`b` and `bk` respectively) to understand their bit positions.

3. **Handling k = 1**:
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the program returns the sequence `[2]` which is correct because the only possible sums are `0` and `2` (not `1`).
   - For other values of `n` when `k == 1`, the program constructs a sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ...]`. This sequence ensures that every sum from `1` to `n` can be formed except `1` itself.

4. **Handling k != 1**:
   - The program constructs a sequence starting with powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
   - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the sequence up to this point is `k-1` (excluding `k`).
   - The program then adds `k+1` and `2*k+1` to the sequence. These values are chosen to avoid forming the sum `k` while still being able to form all sums up to `n`.
   - Finally, it adds the remaining powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No Subsequence with Sum k**: The program specifically avoids creating a subsequence that sums to `k` by carefully choosing the values in the sequence.
- **All Sums from 1 to n (excluding k)**: The sequence constructed ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` can be formed except for `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the test cases as per the problem description. The logic for constructing the sequence is sound and ensures that the conditions are met.

**Correctness: True**
