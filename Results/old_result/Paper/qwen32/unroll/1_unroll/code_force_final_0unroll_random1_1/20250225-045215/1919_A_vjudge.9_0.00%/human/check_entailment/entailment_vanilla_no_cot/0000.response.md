To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` in the context of the problem statement.

The problem states that Alice and Bob take turns playing a game where they can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. The game is played optimally by both players.

The key observation for solving this problem is to consider the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `a + b`. If `a + b` is even, Bob wins; if `a + b` is odd, Alice wins. This is because each move reduces the total number of coins by 1, and the parity of the total number of coins changes with each move.

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'
```

This function correctly checks the parity of `a + b` and returns 'Bob' if it is even and 'Alice' if it is odd, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
