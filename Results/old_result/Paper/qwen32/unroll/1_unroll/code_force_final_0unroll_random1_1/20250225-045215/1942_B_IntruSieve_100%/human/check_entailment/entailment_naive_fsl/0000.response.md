Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Let's analyze why:

The key component of the problem is to determine the permutation \( p \) such that for each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \), the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) holds.

The provided code attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) by maintaining a `mex` list and a `used` dictionary to keep track of the numbers that have been used so far. However, the logic for determining the elements of \( p \) is flawed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization of `minn` and `used`**:
   - `minn` starts at 0 and is used to find the MEX value.
   - `used` is a dictionary that keeps track of the numbers that have been used in the permutation.

2. **Processing each element in `arr`**:
   - If `arr[i] > 0`, the code appends `minn` to the `mex` list, marks `minn` as used, and increments `minn` until it finds the next unused number.
   - If `arr[i] <= 0`, the code calculates the value to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and marks this value as used.

3. **Output**:
   - The code prints the `mex` list, which is supposed to be the permutation \( p \).

### Issues:
- The logic for determining the elements of \( p \) is incorrect. The code is not correctly using the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) to find the elements of \( p \).
- The `used` dictionary and `minn` are not being updated in a way that ensures the correct MEX value is found for each step.

### Example:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The correct output should be a permutation \( p \) such that:
- \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1) - p_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2) - p_2 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3) - p_3 = -2 \)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) - p_4 = 1 \)
- \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5) - p_5 = 2 \)

One valid permutation \( p \) is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.

However, the provided code does not correctly reconstruct this permutation. Instead, it outputs a sequence that does not satisfy the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). There are cases where the program will not produce a valid permutation that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
