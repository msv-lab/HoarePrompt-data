Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios. The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to '?' positions is flawed and does not consider the constraints properly.

Here are some key issues:
1. The program does not check the maximum consecutive constraint for all permutations of scenarios.
2. The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to '?' positions is overly simplistic and does not guarantee the required condition.
3. The program does not handle the partial assignments of 'F' and 'S' correctly to ensure the final assignment meets the criteria.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to implement a more sophisticated approach that ensures the maximum consecutive constraint is met for all possible permutations of scenarios. This might involve backtracking, dynamic programming, or a similar method to explore different assignments and validate them against the constraint.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct solution would require a more thorough algorithmic approach, which is not provided in the given program. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
