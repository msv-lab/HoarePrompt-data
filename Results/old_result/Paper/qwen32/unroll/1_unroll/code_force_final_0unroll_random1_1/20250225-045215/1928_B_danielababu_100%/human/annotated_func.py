#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and returns a map object that contains integers. These integers are typically expected to be read from the input, which in the context of the problem, would be the elements of the array `a` for a given test case.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers. These integers are derived from the elements of the array `a` for a given test case, which are read from the input and split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not have any parameters. It returns a list of integers, which are obtained by reading a line of input and splitting it into individual integer values.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by reading a line of input and splitting it into individual integer values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, splits this line into individual components based on whitespace, converts each component into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4()`.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, sorts these integers, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature, thus no precondition can be derived from the given function.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each element of the list produced by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes no input parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each substring. The map object effectively contains the same substrings as the list, since they are already strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters where each character is an element from the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of characters where each character is an element from the input string provided by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters defined in its signature, so there are no variables or relationships to describe.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a word from the input, split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no input and returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a word from the user's input, split by whitespace.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]

    #State: `arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list where each element at index `i` is the product of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` is the product of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each element at index `i` is the product of the first `i+1` elements of the input list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):

    #State: `arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` in reverse order; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` which contains the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing the cumulative product of the elements of the input list in reverse order.
