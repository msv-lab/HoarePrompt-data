You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also present in list `b`. The function prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Maxim has two arrays: `a` (of length `n`) and `b` (of length `m`).
- We need to find how many subarrays of `a` of length `m` contain at least `k` elements that can be rearranged to match elements of `b`.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_val` is set to 1,000,000, which is the maximum possible value for elements in `a` and `b`.
   - `cnt_b` is an array of size `max_val + 1` initialized to 0. It will be used to count occurrences of elements in `b`.

2. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - For each element in `b`, the program increments the corresponding index in `cnt_b`.

4. **Checking Initial Window:**
   - The program checks the first subarray of `a` of length `m`:
     - For each element in this subarray, if it is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is still non-negative.
     - If `curr` (the number of matching elements) is at least `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - The program then slides the window across `a`:
     - For each new position, it adjusts the counts in `cnt_b`:
       - It increments the count for the element that is sliding out of the window.
       - It decrements the count for the element that is sliding into the window.
       - It updates `curr` accordingly.
     - If `curr` is at least `k` after adjusting, it increments `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program outputs `ans`.

7. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After each test case, the program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for elements in `b`.

### Correctness:
The program uses a sliding window approach, which is efficient for this problem. It correctly counts the number of valid subarrays by maintaining the count of elements in the current window and adjusting it as the window slides. The use of `cnt_b` ensures that the program can efficiently check if an element in `a` matches an element in `b` and adjust the count accordingly.

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- When `k` is 1, any subarray with at least one matching element is valid.
- When `k` is `m`, the subarray must match all elements in `b`.
- When `m` is 1, each element in `a` is a subarray of length 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution and handles all given constraints and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
