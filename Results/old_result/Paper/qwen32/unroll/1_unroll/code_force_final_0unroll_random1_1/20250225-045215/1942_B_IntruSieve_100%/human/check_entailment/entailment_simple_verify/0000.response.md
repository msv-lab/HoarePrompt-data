### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and whether it accurately constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

The problem specifies the relationship:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
where \(\texttt{MEX}\) is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the list \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \).

Let's walk through the annotated code and verify if it correctly constructs \( p \).

#### Key Steps in the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the smallest unused non-negative integer.
   - `used` is an empty dictionary to keep track of the integers that have been used in \( p \).

2. **Processing Each Element in `arr`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, the code appends `minn` to `mex`, marks `minn` as used, and increments `minn` until it finds the next unused number.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, the code calculates the value to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and marks this value as used.

3. **Output**:
   - The code prints the `mex` list, which is supposed to be the permutation \( p \).

#### Analysis:
- **When `arr[i] > 0`**:
  - The code correctly appends the current smallest unused integer (`minn`) to `mex` and marks it as used.
  - It then increments `minn` to the next smallest unused integer.
  
- **When `arr[i] <= 0`**:
  - The code calculates the value to append as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
  - It then marks this value as used.
  
However, the logic for handling `arr[i] <= 0` is problematic. The value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is not necessarily the correct value for \( p_i \). Instead, we need to find the correct \( p_i \) such that:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The correct output should be a permutation \( p \) such that:
- \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1) - p_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2) - p_2 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3) - p_3 = -2 \)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) - p_4 = 1 \)
- \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5) - p_5 = 2 \)

One valid permutation \( p \) is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.

The provided code does not correctly handle the case when `arr[i] <= 0`. It simply calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and marks it as used, which does not guarantee that the resulting permutation \( p \) will satisfy the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). There are cases where the program will not produce a valid permutation that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
