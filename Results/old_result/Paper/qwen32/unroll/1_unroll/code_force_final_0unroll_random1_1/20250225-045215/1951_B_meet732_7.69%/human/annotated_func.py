#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two parts: the first part is a list of two integers [n, k] (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) where n is the number of cows and k is your cow's index, and the second part is a list of n integers [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i's being pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of the number of cows `n`, the 1-based index `k` of a specific cow, and a list of the cows' ratings. For each test case, the function identifies up to two cows with ratings higher than the cow at index `k`. Based on the indices of these cows, it returns a value representing the position of the cow with the next higher rating relative to the cow at index `k`, or the total number of cows minus one if no such cow exists.
