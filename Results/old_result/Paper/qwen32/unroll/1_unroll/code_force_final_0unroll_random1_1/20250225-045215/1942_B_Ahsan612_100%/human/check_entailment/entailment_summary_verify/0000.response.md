### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment using the given problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Farmer John gives Bessie an array `a` of length `n` and challenges her to construct a permutation `p` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The `MEX` of an array is the minimum non-negative integer not appearing in that array.

#### Provided Program:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a list `res` where each element `res_i` is calculated as `mex - ar_i`, with `mex` starting at `n` and updating based on the values in `a`.

#### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment states that the provided program is incorrect. It explains that the program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` and does not maintain the `mex` value properly.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `mex`**:
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`. This is incorrect because the `mex` should start at `0` and be updated as elements are added to the permutation `p`.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. This is not consistent with the problem's requirement to compute `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i)` for each `i` in sequence.

3. **Updating `mex`**:
   - The program updates `mex` based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`. This condition is not appropriate for maintaining the `mex` value correctly.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - The program does not maintain a set of available numbers to ensure that `res` is a valid permutation. Instead, it simply calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` without ensuring that `res[i]` is a valid element that hasn't been used before.

#### Correct Approach:
To construct the permutation `p` correctly, we need to:
- Maintain a set of available numbers (initially all numbers from `0` to `n-1`).
- For each `a_i`, calculate `p_i` as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_{i-1}) - a_i`.
- Remove `p_i` from the set of available numbers to ensure `p` remains a valid permutation.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        available = set(range(n))
        for i in range(n):
            mex = min(available)
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            available.remove(res[i])
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` and does not maintain the `mex` value properly. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final: **False**
