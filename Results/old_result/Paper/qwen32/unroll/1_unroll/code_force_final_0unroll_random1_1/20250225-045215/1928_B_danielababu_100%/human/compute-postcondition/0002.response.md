To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `arr`, and the range parameters (`len(arr) - 1`, `-1`, `-1`). The loop iterates from the last index of `arr` down to `0` with a step of `-1`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`arr`**: The list `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute because the range function `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)` requires `len(arr) - 1` to be a non-negative integer.
2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to `len(arr) - 1` at the start of the loop. We don't need to manually set `i` before the loop starts because it's controlled by the range function.
3. **`ans`** and **`tem`**: These variables are not part of the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `arr` has at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is an empty list; `tem` is 1**
