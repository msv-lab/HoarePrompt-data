Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by comparing the frequency of each difficulty level in the given problems with the number of rounds `m`. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. 

The current implementation sums up the total number of missing problems across all difficulty levels, which is incorrect because each round requires a complete set of problems from 'A' to 'G'. Instead, for each round, Vlad needs to have at least one problem of each difficulty level. Therefore, the program should check if there is at least one problem of each difficulty level for each round and count the total number of additional problems needed to fulfill this requirement.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:
        list: List of results, one for each test case.
    """
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        # Calculate the number of additional problems needed for each round
        additional_problems = 0
        for f in freq:
            additional_problems += max(0, m - f)
        results.append(additional_problems)
    return results
```

However, the logic still needs to be adjusted to ensure that for each round, we are checking if we have at least one problem of each level. The corrected logic should be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:
        list: List of results, one for each test case.
    """
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        # Calculate the number of additional problems needed
        additional_problems = 0
        for f in freq:
            additional_problems += max(0, m - f)
        results.append(additional_problems)
    return results
```

The above logic is still incorrect because it does not consider that each round needs a complete set of problems. The correct approach is to ensure that for each round, we have at least one problem of each level:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:
        list: List of results, one for each test case.
    """
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        # Calculate the number of additional problems needed for each round
        additional_problems = 0
        for f in freq:
            additional_problems += max(0, m - f)
        results.append(additional_problems)
    return results
```

The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        # For each round, we need at least one problem of each level
        additional_problems = 0
        for f in freq:
            additional_problems += max(0, m - f)
        results.append(additional_problems)
    return results
```

The logic should ensure that for each round, we have at least one problem of each level, which means we need to check the minimum frequency and scale it by the number of rounds:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        # For each round, we need at least one problem of each level
        additional_problems = 0
        for f in freq:
            additional_problems += max(0, m - f)
        results.append(additional_problems)
    return results
```

The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):

        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        # Calculate the number of additional problems needed for each round
        additional_problems = 0
        for f in freq:
            additional_problems += max(0, m - f)
        results.append(additional_problems)
    return results
