Reasoning:  
The program's logic is based on counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each test case's string `s` and then printing the sum of these counts. The program correctly interprets the problem's requirement to find the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful by identifying the total occurrences of the substrings that make the string ugly. Each occurrence of "map" or "pie" needs to be reduced by at least one character to avoid the substring, and the sum of these occurrences directly gives the minimum number of deletions required, assuming that deletions can overlap and do not affect subsequent counts (which is true for this problem).

However, the problem statement asks for the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string beautiful, which is correctly addressed by the sum of occurrences of "map" and "pie". The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements, and the annotated states of the program match the expected behavior.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
