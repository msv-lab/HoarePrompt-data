The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the range is defined by `n`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(0, n)` will generate values for `j` from 0 up to, but not including, `n`. The other variables `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are not directly part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is [0, 2, 6], `idx_A` is [0, 2, 4], `B` is [], `idx_B` is []**
