Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob starts with a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he wants to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. If the new rectangle is different from the original one (considering 90Â° rotations as the same rectangle), he succeeds.

### Key Observations:
1. **Odd Dimensions**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different rectangle. This is because cutting an odd-sized side in half results in non-integer sides, and cutting an odd-sized rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides would result in two rectangles of the same dimensions as the original (rotated), which do not form a different rectangle.
2. **Even Dimensions**: If either \(a\) or \(b\) (or both) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different rectangle. For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut it into two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\), which can be rearranged into a rectangle of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads an integer \(t\) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\). It then prints 'Yes' if either \(a\) or \(b\) can be split into two equal parts such that neither part is equal to the other integer, and 'No' otherwise.

### Detailed Steps of the Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates \(t\) times.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
3. **Check Evenness**:
   - If \(a\) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangles. If \(\frac{a}{2}\) is not equal to \(b\), it prints "Yes".
   - If \(b\) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles. If \(\frac{b}{2}\) is not equal to \(a\), it prints "Yes".
   - If neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is even, it prints "No".

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program correctly identifies when Bob can form a different rectangle and when he cannot, based on the evenness of the dimensions. Specifically:
- It correctly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd by printing "No".
- It correctly handles the case where either \(a\) or \(b\) is even by checking if the resulting rectangles can form a different rectangle.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:
1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where \(a = b\) and both are even. For example, if \(a = b = 4\), the program will print "Yes" because \(a\) is even and \(\frac{a}{2} \neq b\). However, cutting a \(4 \times 4\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 4\) rectangles and rearranging them will still result in a \(4 \times 4\) rectangle (rotated). Therefore, the program should print "No" in this case.
2. **Simplified Logic**: The program could be simplified to just checking if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even without the need for additional checks. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always form a different rectangle.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program is incorrect due to the handling of the edge case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even and equal. The corrected program simplifies the logic and correctly handles all cases.

Final: **False**
