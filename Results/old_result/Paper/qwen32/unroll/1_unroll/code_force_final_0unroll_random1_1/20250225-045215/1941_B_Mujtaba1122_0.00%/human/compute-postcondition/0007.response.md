Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `list`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list). The function returns a value based on the following cases: Case_1: If the list has at least `n` elements, it returns the `n`-th largest unique element in the list; Case_2: If there are fewer than `n` unique elements in the list, it returns an error message indicating that there are not enough unique elements.**
