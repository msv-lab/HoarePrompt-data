Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the prefix sum array `pd` and uses it to determine the sum of the digits for each test case.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The loop `for j in str(i): pd[i] += int(j)` is intended to add the digits of `i` to `pd[i]`, but `pd[i]` is also being incremented by `pd[i-1]` in the same loop. This means that `pd[i]` will not only contain the sum of the digits of `i` but also the sum of the digits of all previous numbers, which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach would be to first calculate the sum of the digits of `i` and then add it to `pd[i]` after setting `pd[i]` to `pd[i-1]`.

2. **Initialization of `pd`**:
   - The array `pd` is initialized with `N` elements, but it should be initialized with `N+1` elements to accommodate the range from 0 to `N`.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sum array `pd` up to the maximum possible value of `n` (i.e., `2 * 10^5`). This calculation is done outside of the test cases, which is fine, but the logic for calculating the prefix sums is flawed as mentioned above.
   - The program should correctly calculate the prefix sums, and then for each test case, it should simply print the value of `pd[n]`.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        digit_sum = sum(int(j) for j in str(i))
        pd[i] = pd[i - 1] + digit_sum
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  - `digit_sum = sum(int(j) for j in str(i))` calculates the sum of the digits of `i`.
  - `pd[i] = pd[i - 1] + digit_sum` correctly adds the sum of the digits of `i` to the prefix sum of the previous numbers.
- **Efficiency**:
  - The prefix sum array `pd` is calculated once and reused for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

Since the original program does not correctly calculate the prefix sums, it will not produce the correct output for the given problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
