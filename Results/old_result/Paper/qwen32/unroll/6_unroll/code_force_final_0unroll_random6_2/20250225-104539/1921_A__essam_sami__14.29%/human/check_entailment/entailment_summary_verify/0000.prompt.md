You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It then calculates the squared distances between two pairs of opposite corners of the square and prints the smaller of the two squared distances.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller one as the area of the square. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the points being compared are opposite corners of the square. The program does not correctly identify the correct pairs of points to calculate the side length of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
1 0
0 1
1 1
```
The correct area of the square is 1 (since the side length is 1). However, the program might calculate the distance between (0,0) and (1,0) which is 1, and also between (0,1) and (1,1) which is 1, and print 1, which is correct in this case. But let's consider another case:

```
1
0 0
2 0
0 2
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is 4 (since the side length is 2). However, the program might calculate the distance between (0,0) and (2,0) which is 4, and also between (0,2) and (2,2) which is 4, and print 4, which is correct in this case. But let's consider a case where the program might fail:

```
1
0 0
1 0
0 1
2 1
```
In this case, the correct area of the square is 1 (since the side length is 1). However, the program might calculate the distance between (0,0) and (1,0) which is 1, but also between (0,1) and (2,1) which is 2, and print 1, which is incorrect because the points (0,1) and (2,1) are not opposite corners of the square.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
