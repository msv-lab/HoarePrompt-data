The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, and stores these components in a set called `nums`. Given that `N` is the number of test cases, the input is expected to be a single line of space-separated values. The set `nums` will contain unique elements from this input line.

Output State: **`N` is the number of test cases, which is an integer input (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^4); `nums` is a set containing unique space-separated values from the input line.**
