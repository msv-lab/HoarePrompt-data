Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `k` of `n` integers. Each integer `k_i` in the list `k` is between 2 and 20. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
