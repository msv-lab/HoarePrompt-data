Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description in all cases. Let's analyze the code and identify a potential issue:

The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the way the array `ans` is constructed in the function does not guarantee this property for all inputs.

Here is an example where the provided code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:** Any `a` such that `a[1] % a[0] == 1` and `a[2] % a[1] == 1`. For example, `2 3 4` or `2 5 6` are valid outputs.

**Actual Output from the code:**
```
2 3 4
```

While `2 3 4` is a valid output, let's consider another input:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 3
```

**Expected Output:** Any `a` such that `a[1] % a[0] == 2` and `a[2] % a[1] == 3`. For example, `3 5 8` or `4 6 9` are valid outputs.

**Actual Output from the code:**
```
3 5 8
```

This output is correct for this particular case, but let's consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 4 1
```

**Expected Output:** Any `a` such that `a[1] % a[0] == 2`, `a[2] % a[1] == 4`, and `a[3] % a[2] == 1`. For example, `3 5 9 10` or `4 6 10 11` are valid outputs.

**Actual Output from the code:**
```
3 5 4 9
```

This output is incorrect because `4 % 5` is not equal to `4`. The correct value for `ans[2]` should be `9` (since `9 % 5 == 4`), and then `ans[3]` should be `10` (since `10 % 9 == 1`).

Thus, the code does not always produce the correct output for the given problem description, and therefore it is incorrect.
