### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and compare it to the problem description and the provided example outputs.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
    - The beauty of an array is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
    - We need to rearrange the array to maximize this beauty.
    - The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

2. **Program Analysis**:
    - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
    - It then checks the order of the array using the function `func_1`.
    - If `func_1` returns `True` (indicating the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order), the program prints `0`. This is incorrect because even if the array is sorted, the beauty is not necessarily `0`. It should print the beauty of the sorted array.
    - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
    - `func_1` counts the number of non-increasing consecutive pairs in the array.
    - If there are no such pairs (`order == 0`), the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `func_1` returns `True`.
    - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
    - The main issue is in the handling of the case when `func_1` returns `True`. The program incorrectly prints `0` instead of calculating the beauty of the sorted array.
    - The logic to calculate the beauty is correct when `func_1` returns `False`.

5. **Fixing the Program**:
    - The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty, regardless of whether `func_1` returns `True` or `False`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it incorrectly handles the case when the array is already sorted. It should always sort the array and calculate the beauty.

### Correctness: **False**
