### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly addresses the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
- Given `n` outcomes, each with a multiplier `k_i`, we need to determine the bets `x_i` such that the total bet is strictly less than the total return for any winning outcome.
- The total bet is `sum(x_i)`.
- For any winning outcome `i`, the return is `k_i * x_i`.
- The condition to satisfy is: `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of outcomes) and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of Multipliers:**
   - The program calculates the LCM of all `k_i` values and stores it in `den`.
   - This is done using the function `func_1(a, b)`, which calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b`.

3. **Calculating the Bet Distribution:**
   - The program calculates a list `vprod` where each element is `den // k_i`.
   - This essentially calculates the smallest possible bets such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) minus the sum of `vprod` is greater than 0.
   - If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the list `vprod` as the bet distribution.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The program calculates the LCM of all multipliers `k_i` and then divides this LCM by each `k_i` to determine the bets.
- The bets calculated in `vprod` ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome because:
  - `sum(vprod) = den - den // k_i` for any `i`.
  - Since `den` is the LCM of all `k_i`, `den // k_i` will be an integer and `den` will be the smallest number that is a multiple of all `k_i`.
  - Thus, `sum(vprod) < den` and `den < k_i * (den // k_i)` for any `i`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly calculates a valid bet distribution if possible, or correctly identifies when no such distribution is possible.

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: True**
