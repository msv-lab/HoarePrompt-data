Output State: **`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**

In simpler terms, the variable `T` is now set to the integer value provided by the user input, while the other conditions regarding `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
