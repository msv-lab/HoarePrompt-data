To calculate the output state, we need to understand how the `ans` list is constructed based on the given rules. Here is how the `ans` list is built:

1. `ans[0]` is initialized to `arr[0] + 1`.
2. For each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]`:
   - It is initially calculated as `ans[i] + arr[i + 1]`.
   - If this value is not greater than `arr[i + 1]`, then multiples of `ans[i]` are added to ensure `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
3. The last element `ans[-1]` is calculated as `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

Given the constraints, we can summarize that `ans` is a list where each element is greater than the corresponding element in `arr`, and each element (except the last) is built by adding the previous element in `ans` to the current element in `arr` and possibly more multiples of the previous `ans` element.

Since the exact values of `arr` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values for `ans`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the construction rules provided.

Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i + 1]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
