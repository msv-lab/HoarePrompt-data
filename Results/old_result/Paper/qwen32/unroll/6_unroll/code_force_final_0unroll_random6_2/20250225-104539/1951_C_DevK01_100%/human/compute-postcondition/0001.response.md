The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. However, the loop will iterate based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to make the loop execute. They will be defined and used within the loop body.

So, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to make `t` greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
