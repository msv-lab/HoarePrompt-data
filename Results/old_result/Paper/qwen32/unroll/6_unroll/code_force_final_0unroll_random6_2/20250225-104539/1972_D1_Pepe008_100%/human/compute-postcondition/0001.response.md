The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which is used in the `range(T)`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be at least 1. The variable `t` inside the loop is a different variable and does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Given that `T` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the value of `T` is such that the loop can execute. Since `T` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `T` is at least 1.

State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^6 for each test case** 

However, only `T` is relevant for the loop to execute, so the adjusted state is:

State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4**
