Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). 

However, the given program does not follow this logic. Instead, it calculates a value `suma` based on some formula involving `a` and `b`, and then outputs `suma - 2`. The formula used in the program does not correspond to the problem's requirements, and the logic for counting valid pairs is not present.

The program's logic seems to be attempting to count something based on the value of `a` and `b`, but it does not correctly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Additionally, the subtraction of 2 from `suma` is not explained and does not align with the problem's requirements.

Thus, the program is incorrect based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **False**
