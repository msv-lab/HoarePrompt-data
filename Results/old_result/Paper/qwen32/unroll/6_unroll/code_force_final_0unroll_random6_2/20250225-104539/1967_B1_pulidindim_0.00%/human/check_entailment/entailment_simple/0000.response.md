### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\). For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). The program then initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\). It enters a loop where it calculates the number of valid pairs for each \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).

The logic inside the loop seems to be incorrect. Let's break it down:

1. `countmins = count - 1`: This sets `countmins` to \(b-1\).
2. `g = n / count`: This calculates \(g\) as \(n / b\).
3. `if g < countmins: break`: This breaks the loop if \(n / b < b-1\).
4. `g -= countmins`: This subtracts \(b-1\) from \(g\).
5. `ans += g / count + 1`: This adds \((g / b) + 1\) to `ans`.
6. `count += 1`: This increments \(b\) by 1.

The loop seems to be trying to count the number of \(a\) values for each \(b\) that satisfy the condition, but the logic is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `g` and how it is used to update `ans` does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. A more straightforward approach would be:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

However, this approach would be inefficient for large \(n\) and \(m\) due to its \(O(nm)\) complexity. A more optimized approach would be required for the given constraints, but the provided program does not seem to implement such an optimized approach correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
