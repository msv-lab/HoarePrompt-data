To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the given loop:

```python
for k in queries:
    result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
```

- `n`: Remains unchanged.
- `operations`: Remains unchanged.
- `queries`: Remains unchanged.
- `array`: Remains unchanged.
- `result`: This list is updated by appending elements from `array` based on the indices specified by `queries`.

Here's what the loop does:
- For each element `k` in `queries`, it calculates the index as `(k - 1) % len(array)`.
- It then appends the element at that index in `array` to `result`.

Since `result` is the only variable that changes, we need to determine what elements will be appended to it based on the values in `queries`.

Let's assume the following example values to illustrate the process (since the actual values are not provided):
- `array = [10, 20, 30, 40]`
- `queries = [1, 2, 5, 3]`

Now, let's go through the loop iterations:
1. For `k = 1`: `(1 - 1) % 4 = 0`, so `result` becomes `[10]`.
2. For `k = 2`: `(2 - 1) % 4 = 1`, so `result` becomes `[10, 20]`.
3. For `k = 5`: `(5 - 1) % 4 = 4 % 4 = 0`, so `result` becomes `[10, 20, 10]`.
4. For `k = 3`: `(3 - 1) % 4 = 2`, so `result` becomes `[10, 20, 10, 30]`.

Thus, after all iterations, the `result` list will be `[10, 20, 10, 30]`.

Output State: **`n`: Remains unchanged, `operations`: Remains unchanged, `queries`: Remains unchanged, `array`: Remains unchanged, `result`: `[10, 20, 10, 30]`.**
