Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of the input integer. The conditions on `t`, `n`, and the list of integers remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
