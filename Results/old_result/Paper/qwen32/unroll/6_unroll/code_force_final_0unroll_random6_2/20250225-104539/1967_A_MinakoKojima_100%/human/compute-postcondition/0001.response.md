In the provided for loop, the loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the `range(int(input()))`. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it does not need to be adjusted.

Given this, we only need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `ans_list`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
