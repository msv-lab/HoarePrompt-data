To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description. The key part of the problem revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of coins in both wallets. If the sum of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially boils down to who will be the last to make a move, which depends on the parity of the total number of coins.

Let's break down the logic of the provided code:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. **Sum Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the sum of coins in both wallets (`a + b`).
3. **Parity Check**: It checks if the sum is even using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1 == 0`). If the result is 0, the sum is even, and it prints "Bob". If the result is 1, the sum is odd, and it prints "Alice".

### Analysis:
- **Even Sum**: If the sum of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob wins. This is correctly handled by the code.
- **Odd Sum**: If the sum of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice wins. This is also correctly handled by the code.

### Testing with Example Cases:
Let's verify the code with the provided example cases:

1. **Input**: `1 1`
   - Sum: `1 + 1 = 2` (Even)
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `1 4`
   - Sum: `1 + 4 = 5` (Odd)
   - Output: `Alice`
   - Expected: `Alice` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `5 3`
   - Sum: `5 + 3 = 8` (Even)
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `4 5`
   - Sum: `4 + 5 = 9` (Odd)
   - Output: `Alice`
   - Expected: `Alice` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `11 9`
   - Sum: `11 + 9 = 20` (Even)
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

6. **Input**: `83 91`
   - Sum: `83 + 91 = 174` (Even)
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

7. **Input**: `1032 9307`
   - Sum: `1032 + 9307 = 10339` (Odd)
   - Output: `Alice`
   - Expected: `Alice` (Correct)

8. **Input**: `839204 7281`
   - Sum: `839204 + 7281 = 846485` (Odd)
   - Output: `Alice`
   - Expected: `Alice` (Correct)

9. **Input**: `1000000000 1000000000`
   - Sum: `1000000000 + 1000000000 = 2000000000` (Even)
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

10. **Input**: `53110 2024`
    - Sum: `53110 + 2024 = 55134` (Even)
    - Output: `Bob`
    - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets. It handles all the given example cases correctly and does not seem to have any logical errors for the provided problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
