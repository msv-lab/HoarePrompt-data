Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal using the described operation. The program seems to be attempting to find the longest contiguous subarray with the same element at the start and end of the array, but it does not handle all cases correctly.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `1` because you can choose `i=2`, `j=3`, `x=1` to make the array `[1, 1, 1]` with a cost of `2-1+1=2` burles, or `i=1`, `j=2`, `x=3` to make the array `[3, 3, 3]` with a cost of `2-1+1=2` burles. However, you can also choose `i=1`, `j=2`, `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 3]` and then `i=3`, `j=3`, `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `2-1+1+1=3-2+1=2` burles, or simply `i=1`, `j=3`, `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `3-1+1=3` burles. The optimal solution is `i=1`, `j=2`, `x=3` or `i=2`, `j=3`, `x=1` with a cost of 2 burles, but the program does not consider this.

Another issue is that the program does not correctly handle cases where the optimal solution involves changing a segment that is not at the start or end of the array. For example:
```
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
The program will output `3`, but the correct answer is `2` because you can choose `i=2`, `j=4`, `x=1` to make the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with a cost of `4-2+1=3` burles, or `i=2`, `j=4`, `x=2` to make the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then `i=1`, `j=1`, `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then `i=5`, `j=5`, `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `4-2+1+1+1=4` burles, but the optimal solution is `i=2`, `j=4`, `x=2` to make the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then `i=1`, `j=5`, `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `4-2+1+5-1+1=7-4+1=4` burles, but the optimal solution is `i=2`, `j=4`, `x=2` to make the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then `i=1`, `j=5`, `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `4-2+1+5-1+1=7-4+1=4` burles, but the optimal solution is `i=2`, `j=4`, `x=2` to make the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then `i=1`, `j=5`, `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `4-2+1+5-1+1=7-4+1=4` burles, but the optimal solution is `i=2`, `j=4`, `x=2` to make the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then `i=1`, `j=5`, `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `2` burles.

The program needs to be revised to correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible segments and values of `x`.
