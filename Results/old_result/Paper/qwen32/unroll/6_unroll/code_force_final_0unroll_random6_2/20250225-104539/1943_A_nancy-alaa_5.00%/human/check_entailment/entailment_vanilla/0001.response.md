Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from array `a` and manipulating array `c` and `a` according to the rules. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c` after all elements are removed from `a`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Observations

1. **Turns and Optimal Play**: Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they make the best moves possible to achieve their objectives. Alice will try to add elements to `c` that increase the MEX, while Bob will try to prevent this.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is determined by the smallest missing non-negative integer in `c`. Therefore, the goal is to ensure that `c` contains as many consecutive integers starting from 0 as possible, but Alice and Bob's actions affect this.

### Strategy

- **Alice's Goal**: To maximize MEX, Alice should aim to add elements to `c` that extend the sequence of consecutive integers as much as possible.
- **Bob's Goal**: To minimize MEX, Bob should aim to disrupt the sequence of consecutive integers by picking elements that Alice might have chosen to extend the sequence.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `a`. It then iterates through the possible integers from 0 to `n-1` to find the MEX. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Counting Elements**: The `Counter` object `mpp` is used to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
2. **Finding MEX**: The program iterates through integers from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is not present in `a` at all, so it is the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` is present in `mpp` with a count of 1 and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` as the MEX.
   - The variable `first` is set to `True` when the first element with a count of 1 is encountered.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly account for the turns and optimal play of Alice and Bob. It simply finds the first integer that appears once or is missing, which does not consider the strategic removal of elements by Bob.
2. **Lack of Turn Handling**: The program does not simulate the turns or the strategic removal of elements by Bob, which is crucial for determining the correct MEX.
3. **Incorrect Use of `first` Variable**: The `first` variable is used incorrectly. It does not help in determining the MEX correctly based on the game rules.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
