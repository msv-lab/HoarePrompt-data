The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list `vals` of integers from the user, calculates a product of all elements in `vals`, then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by each respective element in `vals`. It then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from the product. If the result is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function returns `None`.
