Let's analyze the loop and understand how the variables change.

Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \).
- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \).
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `arr[0] + 1`.

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3` (since the range is `n - 2`).

For each iteration:
- `ans[i + 1]` is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
- If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, a while loop increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` repeatedly until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

Let's break down what happens in each iteration:
1. `i = 0`: `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 1`. If `ans[1] <= arr[1]`, then `ans[1]` is incremented by `ans[0]` until `ans[1] > arr[1]`.
2. `i = 1`: `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1]`. If `ans[2] <= arr[2]`, then `ans[2]` is incremented by `ans[1]` until `ans[2] > arr[2]`.
3. This pattern continues until `i = n - 3`.

The final value of `ans` after the loop will be such that each `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]` if necessary.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and each subsequent `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]` if necessary.**
