### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases, each consisting of a number `n` and a list of `2n` integers. The goal is to pair these integers in such a way that the sum of the minimum values of each pair is maximized.

However, the current implementation has several issues:
1. **Incorrect Pairing Logic**: The program attempts to remove elements from the list after calculating the minimum, but it does so incorrectly. Specifically, it tries to remove `lst[0 * 2]` and `lst[1 * 2]`, which are essentially `lst[0]` and `lst[0]` respectively, leading to incorrect behavior.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition and logic for processing the list are flawed. The loop should iterate over the list in pairs, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the removal of elements.
3. **Sorting**: The optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the minimums is to sort the list first and then pair the smallest elements together. The current program does not sort the list, which means it does not follow the optimal strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = list(map(int, l.split(' ')))
        
        # Sort the list to pair the smallest elements together
        lst.sort()
        
        # Iterate over the sorted list and sum the minimum of each pair
        for i in range(0, n * 2, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified and the need for sorting and correct pairing, the original program does not follow the correct approach to solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
