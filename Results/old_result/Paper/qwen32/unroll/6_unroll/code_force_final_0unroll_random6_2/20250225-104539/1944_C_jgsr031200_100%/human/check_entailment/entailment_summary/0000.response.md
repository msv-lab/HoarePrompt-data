### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the final MEX score of array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. Alice aims to maximize this score, while Bob aims to minimize it.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the solution provided in the program:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: The program calculates the frequency of each element in the array `arr` using a frequency list `freq` where `freq[i]` represents how many times integer `i` appears in `arr`.

2. **Counting Unique Elements**: It then iterates through the frequency list to count how many numbers appear exactly once (`cou += 1`).

3. **Determine MEX**: The program looks for the smallest integer `i` such that:
   - `freq[i]` is 0 (meaning `i` does not appear in `arr`), or
   - `freq[i]` is 1 (meaning `i` appears exactly once in `arr`).
   - It prints this integer `i` as the MEX score.

4. **Optimal Play**: The logic inherently considers the optimal play of both Alice and Bob because Alice will try to pick numbers that maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it. Since the game involves picking numbers and deleting them, the final MEX is determined by the remaining numbers in `c` after all numbers are picked. The strategy of counting unique elements and finding the smallest missing or unique element aligns with the goal of determining the optimal MEX.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the smallest integer between 0 and `n` that does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once, which is equivalent to finding the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Correctness:

Given the problem requirements and the provided solution, the program correctly calculates the MEX score after the game ends when both players play optimally.

**Correctness: True**
