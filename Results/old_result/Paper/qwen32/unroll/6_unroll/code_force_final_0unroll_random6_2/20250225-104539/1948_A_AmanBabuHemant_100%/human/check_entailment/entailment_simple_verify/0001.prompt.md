You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is the same as the initial input integer; `n` is the integer input in the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. The task is to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters.
2. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
3. The output should either be "NO" if no such string exists, or "YES" followed by a valid string of length at most 200 if it does.

### Key Observations:
- For a character to be special, it must be different from one of its neighbors but the same as the other neighbor.
- This implies that a pattern like "AAB" can be used to create special characters. In "AAB", the first 'A' is special, the second 'A' is not, and the 'B' is special.
- If we use the pattern "AAB" repeatedly, each repetition contributes 2 special characters (the first 'A' and the 'B' in "AAB").
- Therefore, to have exactly `n` special characters, `n` must be even because each "AAB" contributes 2 special characters.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
- If `n` is odd, the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters with the "AAB" pattern.
- If `n` is even, the program constructs a string using the "AAB" pattern `n // 2` times.
- The program then checks if the constructed string is of length at most 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies that `n` must be even to have a valid string.
- The program constructs a string using the "AAB" pattern, which guarantees that the number of special characters is exactly `n` when `n` is even.
- The constructed string is guaranteed to be of length at most 200 because `n` is at most 50, and `n // 2` repetitions of "AAB" (which is 3 characters long) will result in a string of length at most 150.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
