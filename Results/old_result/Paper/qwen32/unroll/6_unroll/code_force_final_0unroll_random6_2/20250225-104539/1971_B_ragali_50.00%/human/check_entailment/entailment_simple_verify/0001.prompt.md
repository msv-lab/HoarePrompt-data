You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Input:** A number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by `t` strings `s` (each string of length ≤ 10 and consisting of lowercase letters).
- **Output:** For each string `s`, output "YES" followed by a rearrangement of `s` that is not equal to `s`, or "NO" if no such rearrangement is possible.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over `t` test cases, reading each string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - The program creates a set `a` from the characters of `s` to determine the number of unique characters.
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are multiple different characters in `s`.

3. **Generating a New String:**
   - If there are multiple unique characters, the program attempts to generate a new string `newstr` by rearranging the characters of `s`.
   - The rearrangement is done by taking the second half of `s` and appending the first half of `s` to it.
   - The program checks if `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If it is not, it prints "YES" and `newstr`.
   - If `newstr` is equal to `s`, the program checks if the reverse of `s` is not equal to `s`. If it is not, it prints "YES" and the reverse of `s`.
   - If both `newstr` and the reverse of `s` are equal to `s`, the program prints "YES" and `newstr` again, which might not be correct as it could be equal to `s`.

4. **Handling Strings with Single Unique Character:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1 (i.e., all characters in `s` are the same), the program correctly prints "NO" because no rearrangement of `s` can result in a different string.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program's logic for generating a new string is flawed. It only attempts two specific rearrangements (`newstr` and the reverse of `s`), and if both fail, it incorrectly prints `newstr` again.
- It does not guarantee that a valid rearrangement will be found if one exists.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness:** **False**
