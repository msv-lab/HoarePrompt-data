The code snippet creates a new list `costs` by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the 2D list `rows`, with the additional parameter `d`. This means that each element in `costs` corresponds to the result of `func_1` applied to each row of `rows`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `costs`, which is a list of the results returned by `func_1` for each row in `rows`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` sublists, each containing `m` integers, `costs` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.**
