Let's analyze the given Python program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Inputs:**
   - **t**: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - **n**: Number of children.
     - **m**: Number of pairs of friends.
     - **k**: Number of excursions.
     - **m** lines describing each friendship with two children and their friendship value.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen), expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and compute \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

### Program Analysis:

The provided program is attempting to solve the problem but contains several logical errors:

1. **Initialization of `c`:**
   - The variable `c` is initialized as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). This is correct as it represents the probability of selecting any given pair of children.
   - However, `c` is calculated as `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` which is incorrect. It should be `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Calculation of `a`:**
   - The variable `a` is the sum of all initial friendship values.
   - This is correctly computed by iterating over the `m` lines of input and summing up the friendship values.

3. **Calculation of `s`:**
   - The variable `s` is intended to represent the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` is incorrect. The formula used inside the loop does not correctly compute the expected sum. The expected sum of friendship values for each pair is a more complex calculation involving the probability of selecting each pair and the cumulative increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.

4. **Output:**
   - The final result is printed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is correct.

### Correctness:

The program has logical errors in the calculation of `c` and the expected sum `s`. The expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions requires a more sophisticated approach, involving the calculation of the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over `k` excursions, taking into account the probability of selecting each pair and the cumulative effect of previous selections.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program contains logical errors in the calculation of the modular inverse `c` and the expected sum `s`. The formula used for `s` does not correctly compute the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
Correctness: **False**
