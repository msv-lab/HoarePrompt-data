You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:

            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Annotated Code:

for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, where x represents Vasya's position in the line and n represents the number of people in the line.
def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` is a list of the corresponding quotient divisors of `x`.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that is the concatenation of `output2` and `output1`. `output2` contains the quotient divisors of `x` in the same order as `output1` contains its divisors. `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, sorted such that the larger divisors come first, followed by the smaller divisors in reverse order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to be using a helper function `func_1` that finds the divisors of a number, but the logic to determine the valid `k` values is not correctly implemented based on the problem description. The program does not correctly handle the conditions to determine the valid `k` values for all possible inputs.

Let's analyze the problem and the code in detail:

### Problem Analysis:
1. The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. For a given position `n` and number `x`, we need to find all possible `k` such that the number `x` appears at position `n` in the settling pattern.

### Key Points:
1. For a given `k`, the pattern is: `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2`.
2. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
3. To find the number at a specific position `n`, we need to determine the position within the repeating segment and check if it matches `x`.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. The function `func_1` finds divisors of a number, but it is not clear how these divisors are used to find valid `k` values.
2. The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are not directly related to finding valid `k` values.
3. The logic to check if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` and if it is greater than or equal to `x` is not correct.

### Correct Approach:
1. For each possible `k` starting from `x` to `n`, check if the number `x` appears at position `n` in the settling pattern.
2. The position `n` within the repeating segment can be found using `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2)`.
3. Check if the number at this position in the pattern is `x`.

### Example of a Correct Implementation:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for k in range(x, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k:
            if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 1 - (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == x:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid `k` values for the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.
