You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has a critical issue in handling the second type of operation (where Jayden appends `x` copies of the current array to itself). The code currently uses a list comprehension to extend the array, which is inefficient and incorrect for large values of `x` (up to \(10^9\)). This will result in a memory overflow or extremely slow execution.

Here's a detailed explanation of the problem:

1. **Memory Overflow**: When `x` is large (up to \(10^9\)), the code attempts to create a new list that is `x` times the size of the current array. This will quickly exceed memory limits, especially since the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases can be as large as \(10^5\).

2. **Inefficiency**: Even if memory were not an issue, the operation of extending the list with `x` copies is \(O(x \cdot \text{len(array)})\), which is computationally expensive and will not meet the time constraints for large `x`.

### Correct Approach:

To handle the problem correctly, we need to avoid actually constructing the array and instead keep track of the structure of the array using a more efficient method. One possible approach is to use a tree-like structure or a segment tree to keep track of the segments of the array and their sizes. This way, we can answer queries in logarithmic time without ever constructing the full array.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
1 1
2 1000000000
1
```

In this case, the program will attempt to create a new list that is 1 billion times the size of the current array (which is empty), resulting in a memory overflow or extremely slow execution.

### Conclusion:

The provided code is incorrect because it does not handle the second type of operation efficiently and correctly for large values of `x`. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
