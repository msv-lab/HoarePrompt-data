Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances. However, this approach does not correctly determine the area of the square. The program should calculate the squared distance between any two adjacent points (which would be the side length squared of the square) and then print that value. The current implementation does not ensure that the distances calculated correspond to the sides of the square.
