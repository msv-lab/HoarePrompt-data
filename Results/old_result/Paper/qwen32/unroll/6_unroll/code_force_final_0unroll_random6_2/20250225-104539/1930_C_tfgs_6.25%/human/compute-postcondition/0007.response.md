The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`. The initial state specifies that `n` is the original length of the array `a`, and `a` is a sorted list in descending order with duplicates removed, where each element at index `i` is the original value at that index plus `i + 1`.

Since `a` has duplicates removed, its length (`len(a)`) will be less than or equal to `n`. The value of `cnt` will represent the number of duplicates that were removed from the original list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is the same input integer representing the original length of array `a`; `a` is a sorted list in descending order, where each element at index `i` is the original value at that index plus `i + 1`, with duplicates removed; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the original list `a`; `cnt` is the number of duplicates removed from the original list `a`.**
