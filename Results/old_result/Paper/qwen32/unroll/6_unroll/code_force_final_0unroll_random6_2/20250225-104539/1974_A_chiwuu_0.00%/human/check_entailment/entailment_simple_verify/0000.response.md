### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program's logic and the annotations to determine if the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for all test cases, including edge cases.

#### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

1. **Reading Input**:
    - `n = int(input())`: Number of test cases.
    - For each test case, it reads `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
    - `t = b * 2`: This calculates the number of 2x2 icons.
    - `t = t // 5 + 1 if t % 5 != 0 else t // 5`: This calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the logic attempts to calculate the number of screens needed.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells**:
    - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the total number of cells occupied by the screens used for the 2x2 icons and then subtracts the actual cells occupied by the 2x2 icons to get the remaining cells.
    - `t2 = a - t1`: This calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed after placing the 2x2 icons.
    - `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1 if t2 % 15 != 0 else t + t2 // 15`: This calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

#### Testing the Program

Let's manually verify the logic with the provided test cases and some additional edge cases.

1. **Test Case 1**:
    - Input: `1 1`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
    - Input: `7 2`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
    - Input: `12 4`
    - Expected Output: `2`
    - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
    - Input: `0 3`
    - Expected Output: `2`
    - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
    - Input: `1 0`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6**:
    - Input: `8 1`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7**:
    - Input: `0 0`
    - Expected Output: `0`
    - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

8. **Test Case 8**:
    - Input: `2 0`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

9. **Test Case 9**:
    - Input: `15 0`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

10. **Test Case 10**:
    - Input: `8 2`
    - Expected Output: `2`
    - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

11. **Test Case 11**:
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Expected Output: `5`
    - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

#### Edge Case Analysis

1. **Maximum Icons**:
    - Input: `99 99`
    - Expected Output: `198`
    - Let's break down the calculation:
        - `t = 99 * 2 = 198` (number of 2x2 icons).
        - `t = 198 // 5 + 1 = 40` (screens needed for 2x2 icons).
        - `t1 = 40 * 15 - 99 * 4 = 600 - 396 = 204` (remaining cells).
        - `t2 = 99 - 204 = -105` (negative value, which means no additional 1x1 icons are needed beyond the screens used for 2x2 icons).
        - Since `t2` is negative, the logic should not add any additional screens for 1x1 icons. The output should be `40`, not `198`.

2. **No Icons**:
    - Input: `0 0`
    - Expected Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Only 1x1 Icons**:
    - Input: `15 0`
    - Expected Output: `1` (Correct)

4. **Only 2x2 Icons**:
    - Input: `0 99`
    - Expected Output: `27` (since `99 * 4 = 396` cells, and `396 // 15 = 26.4 -> 27` screens).

#### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons are both at their maximum values (99 each). The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for the maximum case is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output.

### Final Answer

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of edge cases, particularly when both `a` and `b` are at their maximum values.
