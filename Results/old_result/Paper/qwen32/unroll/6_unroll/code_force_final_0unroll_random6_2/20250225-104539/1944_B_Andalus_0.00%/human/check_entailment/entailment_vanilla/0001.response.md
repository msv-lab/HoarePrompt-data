Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem is to find two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that:
1. `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of the array `a`.
2. `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of the array `a`.
3. The bitwise XOR of elements of `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements of `r`.

### Program Analysis

The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a` of length `2n`. The array `a` is then split into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`.

The program then uses the following strategy to construct `l` and `r`:
1. **Identify Duplicates and Singles:**
   - For the left half `lft`, it identifies elements that appear twice (`ldb`) and elements that appear once (`sng`).
   - For the right half `rgt`, it identifies elements that appear twice (`rdb`).

2. **Constructing `l` and `r`:**
   - For `l`, it first tries to add pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` until it reaches the required length `2k`. If it still needs more elements, it adds single elements from `sng`.
   - It repeats the same process for `r` using `rdb` and `sng`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` as two separate lines.

### Correctness Analysis

Let's consider the correctness of this approach:
- **Identifying Duplicates and Singles:**
  - The program correctly identifies elements that appear twice and elements that appear once in both halves of the array.
  
- **Constructing `l` and `r`:**
  - By adding pairs of duplicate elements, the XOR of these pairs will be `0` (since `x ^ x = 0`).
  - The remaining elements, if any, are single elements that will be added to `l` and `r` in the same order.
  - Since the problem guarantees that every integer from `1` to `n` occurs exactly twice in the array `a`, the XOR of all elements in `a` will be `0`.
  - Therefore, the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal if the program ensures that the same number of each element is included in both `l` and `r`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs `l` and `r` by ensuring that the same number of each element is included in both halves. The XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal because the program ensures that pairs of duplicate elements are added to both `l` and `r`, and any remaining single elements are also added to both `l` and `r`.

Thus, the program is correct for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
