### Reasoning:

The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by generating a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, where the elements at even indices are reversed compared to their original order, while elements at odd indices remain unchanged. However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated permutation will meet the problem's requirement: there should not exist two distinct indices i and j such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Let's analyze the given example and the approach:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Generated permutation: `4 1 2 3`
   - Analysis: 
     - Here, \( p_1 = 4 \) divides \( p_3 = 2 \) and \( p_2 = 1 \) divides \( p_4 = 3 \). 
     - This permutation does not satisfy the condition that there should not exist two distinct indices i and j such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `3`
   - Generated permutation: `1 2 3`
   - Analysis: 
     - This permutation satisfies the condition because there are no two distinct indices i and j such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

However, the first example demonstrates that the approach used in `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation. The reversal of elements at even indices does not prevent the existence of such pairs (i, j) that violate the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs as it does not guarantee that the generated permutation will meet the required condition for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
