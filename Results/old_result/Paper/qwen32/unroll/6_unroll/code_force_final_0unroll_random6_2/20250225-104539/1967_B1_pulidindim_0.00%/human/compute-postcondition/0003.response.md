Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`. The sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
