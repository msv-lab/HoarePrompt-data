Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; `n` is assigned the value of `t`. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. `result` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms: The number of test cases `t` is assigned to `n`. The input consists of `t` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y`. The variable `result` is initialized as an empty list.
