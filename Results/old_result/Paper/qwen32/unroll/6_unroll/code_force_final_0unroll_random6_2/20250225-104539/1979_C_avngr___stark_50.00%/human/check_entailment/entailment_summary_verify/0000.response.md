Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to distribute bets on `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The received coins for the i-th outcome are `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.

### Program Analysis

1. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k` by multiplying all `k` values together. This is not the most efficient way to calculate the LCM, but it does produce the correct LCM value for the given `k` values.

2. **Coefficients Calculation:**
   - The coefficients `c` are calculated as the LCM divided by each `k` value. This is correct because these coefficients represent the minimum bets needed to ensure that if any outcome wins, the return is greater than the sum of all bets.

3. **Normalization:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients and normalizes them by dividing each coefficient by the GCD. This step is unnecessary for solving the problem and can lead to incorrect results, as the normalization does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the minimum required return for any winning outcome.

4. **Check and Output:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized coefficients is less than the normalized LCM. If not, it outputs `-1`. This check is flawed because the normalization step can alter the relationship between the sum of the bets and the required return.

### Function Summary
The function `func_1` calculates the GCD of a list of numbers. This function is correctly implemented, but its use in the program is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

### Counterexample
Let's consider the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```
or any other valid distribution where the sum of the bets is less than the minimum return for any winning outcome (which is `2` in this case).

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
-1
```

The code incorrectly outputs `-1` because the normalization step alters the relationship between the sum of the bets and the required return.

### Corrected Code
The corrected code should avoid normalization and directly check if the sum of the coefficients is less than the LCM. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = reduce(lcm, k)
    c = [m // ki for ki in k]
    if sum(c) >= m:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for ci in c:
            print(ci, end=' ')
        print('')
```

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description due to the unnecessary normalization step, which can lead to incorrect results.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
