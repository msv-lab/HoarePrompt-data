Reasoning:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case based on the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y` where `x` is the number of 1x1 icons and `y` is the number of 2x2 icons.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x` since each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

3. **Screens Required for 2x2 Icons**:
   - Each screen can fit a maximum of 2 2x2 icons (since 2x2 icons take up 4 cells each and a screen has 15 cells, it can fit at most 2 2x2 icons).
   - If `y` is even, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on those screens are calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to accommodate all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), then no additional screens are needed beyond those already used for 2x2 icons.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons. This is done by first calculating the extra space needed (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`) and then determining how many full screens are needed for this extra space. If `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15, an additional screen is needed.

6. **Result Compilation**:
   - The number of screens required for each test case is appended to the `result` list.
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as when there are no 1x1 or 2x2 icons, and when the number of 2x2 icons is odd.

Correctness: **True**
