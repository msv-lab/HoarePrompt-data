Postcondition: **For each of the t test cases, `ac` and `bc` will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the corresponding string of length 5, but these values will not be retained outside the loop as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The variable `t` and the input strings remain unchanged. If the current value of `ac` is greater than the current value of `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
