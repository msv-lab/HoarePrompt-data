You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer from 0 to `n-1` that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once, with the condition that if multiple such integers exist, the smallest one that appears exactly once is printed only if there is no integer that does not appear at all.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy for Alice and Bob to play optimally and does not correctly compute the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the number is not in the `Counter` keys or if it appears exactly once and has already seen an element that appears exactly once. However, this logic does not account for the optimal moves of Alice and Bob, and it does not correctly compute the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
0
```

**Actual Output by the Program:**
```
0
0
0
```

For the first test case, the program outputs `0`, but the correct output should be `2`. The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob make optimal choices to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob make optimal moves. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by picking the largest possible numbers, while Bob will try to minimize it by picking the smallest possible numbers. The MEX is then determined by the final state of the array `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that simulates the game:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        c = []
        turn = True  # Alice's turn

        while len(arr) > 0:
            if turn:
                # Alice's turn: pick the largest possible number
                for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
                    if mpp[i] > 0:
                        c.append(i)
                        mpp[i] -= 1
                        arr.remove(i)
                        break
            else:
                # Bob's turn: pick the smallest possible number
                for i in range(n):
                    if mpp[i] > 0:
                        mpp[i] -= 1
                        arr.remove(i)
                        break
            turn = not turn

        # Calculate the MEX of the array c
        mex = 0
        while mex in c:
            mex += 1
        print(mex)

func()
```

This corrected program simulates the game and correctly computes the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
