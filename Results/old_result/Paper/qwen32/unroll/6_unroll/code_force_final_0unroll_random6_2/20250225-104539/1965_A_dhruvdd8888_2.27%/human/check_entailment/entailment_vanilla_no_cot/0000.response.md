Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and examples. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the optimal play of the game.

Here are a few issues with the program:
1. The program uses a set to store the pile sizes, which removes duplicates. This is incorrect because the game rules depend on the exact number of stones in each pile, not just the unique pile sizes.
2. The program checks the length of the set of unique pile sizes and makes a decision based on that, which is not a correct strategy for determining the winner.
3. The program checks for consecutive differences of 1 in the sorted pile sizes, which is not a correct strategy for determining the winner.
4. The program does not correctly simulate the game where players remove stones from each non-empty pile in each turn.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if both play optimally. If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the player can always make a move to put the opponent in a losing position.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nim_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        nim_sum ^= num
    if nim_sum == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')
```

This corrected program calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
