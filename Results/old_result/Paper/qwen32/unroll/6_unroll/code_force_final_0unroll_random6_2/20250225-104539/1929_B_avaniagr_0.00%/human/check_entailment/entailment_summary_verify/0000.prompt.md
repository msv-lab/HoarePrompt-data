You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and outputs a result for each test case, which indicates whether it is possible to color a square grid of size `n` such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The provided program attempts to solve this problem using a specific formula.

Here is the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

Let's break down the logic of the program:
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
- It then calculates the minimum number of cells to color using the formula:
  \[
  \text{result} = (k // 2 + k \% 2) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2)
  \]
- The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that the formula correctly computes the minimum number of cells to color for any valid \( n \) and \( k \).

Let's consider some cases:
1. **Case 1: \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \)**
   - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
   - The formula calculates: \((4 // 2 + 4 \% 2) \times (4 < 4 \times 3 - 3) + 2 \times 3 \times (4 \geq 4 \times 3 - 3) + (4 == 4 \times 3 - 2) = 3 \times 1 + 6 \times 0 + 0 = 3\)
   - Expected result: 2
   - The formula does not give the correct result for this case.

2. **Case 2: \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \)**
   - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
   - The formula calculates: \((3 // 2 + 3 \% 2) \times (3 < 4 \times 3 - 3) + 2 \times 3 \times (3 \geq 4 \times 3 - 3) + (3 == 4 \times 3 - 2) = 2 \times 1 + 6 \times 0 + 0 = 2\)
   - Expected result: 2
   - The formula gives the correct result for this case.

3. **Case 3: \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \)**
   - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
   - The formula calculates: \((10 // 2 + 10 \% 2) \times (10 < 4 \times 3 - 3) + 2 \times 3 \times (10 \geq 4 \times 3 - 3) + (10 == 4 \times 3 - 2) = 6 \times 0 + 6 \times 1 + 0 = 6\)
   - Expected result: 6
   - The formula gives the correct result for this case.

4. **Case 4: \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \)**
   - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
   - The formula calculates: \((9 // 2 + 9 \% 2) \times (9 < 4 \times 3 - 3) + 2 \times 3 \times (9 \geq 4 \times 3 - 3) + (9 == 4 \times 3 - 2) = 5 \times 0 + 6 \times 1 + 0 = 6\)
   - Expected result: 5
   - The formula does not give the correct result for this case.

From the above analysis, we can see that the formula does not work correctly for all cases. Specifically, it fails for cases where \( k \) is not equal to \( 4n - 2 \) and is less than \( 4n - 3 \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
