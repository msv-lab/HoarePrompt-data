Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a distinct string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' and prints 'A' if 'A' appears more times than 'B', otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.**
