Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and the optimal strategy of both players.

The key insight to solve this problem is to observe that if the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win, and if it is odd, Alice will win. This is because the game can be seen as a series of moves that reduce the total number of coins by 1 each turn. Since Alice starts first, she will make the first, third, fifth, etc., moves. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will make the last move, and Alice will be unable to make a move after that, thus Bob wins. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will make the last move, and Bob will be unable to make a move after that, thus Alice wins.

However, the provided program incorrectly prints the result after processing all test cases, instead of printing the result for each test case individually. As a result, it only prints the outcome for the last test case and does not handle multiple test cases as required.

To fix the program, the print statements should be inside the loop that processes each test case.

Correctness: **False**
