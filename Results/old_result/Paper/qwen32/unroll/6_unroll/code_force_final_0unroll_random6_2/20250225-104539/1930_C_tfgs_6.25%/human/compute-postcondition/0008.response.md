Output State: **`n` is the same input integer representing the original length of array `a`; `a` is a sorted list in descending order, where each element at index `i` is the original value at that index plus `i + 1`, with duplicates removed; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the original list `a`; `cnt` is the number of duplicates removed from the original list `a`; `ans` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the variable `ans` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values and properties.
