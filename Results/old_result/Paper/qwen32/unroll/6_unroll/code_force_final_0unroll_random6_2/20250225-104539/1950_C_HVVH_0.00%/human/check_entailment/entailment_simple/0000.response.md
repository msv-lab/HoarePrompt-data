Reasoning: 

The provided Python program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a time string in the format "hh:mm".
3. It splits this string into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
4. It determines the equivalent 12-hour format hour and whether it should be AM or PM:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets the day to 'PM'.
   - If the hour `h` is exactly 12, it sets the day to 'PM' (since 12 PM is the correct representation).
   - If the hour `h` is between 1 and 11, it keeps `h` as is and sets the day to 'AM'.
5. It prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", ensuring that the hour is always two digits by using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`.

The program correctly handles edge cases such as midnight ("00:00" -> "12:00 AM") and noon ("12:00" -> "12:00 PM").

Given the provided example, the program's output matches the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
