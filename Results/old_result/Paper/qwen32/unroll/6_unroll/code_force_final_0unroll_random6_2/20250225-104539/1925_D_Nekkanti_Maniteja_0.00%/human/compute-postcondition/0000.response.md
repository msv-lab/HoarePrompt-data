The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable used in the `range` function. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which is the number of iterations (`t` in this case). Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input value for `t` is at least 1.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4`.

The state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is within this range and is at least 1 to make the loop execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4`**
