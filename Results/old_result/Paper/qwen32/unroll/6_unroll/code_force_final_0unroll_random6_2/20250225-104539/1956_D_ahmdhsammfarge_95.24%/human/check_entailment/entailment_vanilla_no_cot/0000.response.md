Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Logic Error in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find the best segment `[l, r]` to perform the MEX operation on to maximize the sum. However, the way the sum is calculated inside the nested loops is incorrect. The sum is not being calculated based on the MEX operation, but rather on a heuristic that doesn't guarantee the correct result.

2. **Incorrect Handling of MEX**: The MEX operation is not being correctly applied in the code. The code does not compute the MEX of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` and then set all elements in that subarray to the MEX value.

3. **Recursive Calls in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` is called recursively in a way that does not make sense for the problem. It appears to be trying to generate a sequence of operations, but the logic is flawed.

4. **Operations List (`ops`)**: The operations list is being populated with incorrect values. The operations should be based on the MEX operation results, not arbitrary segments.

5. **Final List Update in `func_3`**: The function `func_3` is supposed to update the list based on the MEX operation, but it does not do so correctly. It simply sets all elements in the segment to the length of the segment, which is not the correct MEX value.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement a strategy that calculates the MEX for each possible subarray `[l, r]`, performs the MEX operation, and updates the array accordingly to maximize the sum. The provided code does not follow this strategy and thus is incorrect.
