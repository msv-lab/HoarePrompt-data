### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating a set of bets for each outcome such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each possible winning outcome. Here’s the detailed reasoning of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The program calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k`. This is done by multiplying all the `k` values together (`m = m * k[i]`). The LCM is used to ensure that each bet can be scaled to a common multiple, which simplifies the problem.

3. **Bet Calculation**: The program then calculates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is `m / k[i]`. This represents the bet for the `i-th` outcome if the total bet is `m`.

4. **GCD Calculation**: The program computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the `func_1` function. This GCD is used to normalize the bets so that they are the smallest possible integers while maintaining the property that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each winning outcome.

5. **Normalization and Validation**: The bets are then normalized by dividing each element in `c` by the GCD. The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the bets are printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed indicating that no valid distribution of bets is possible.

### Analysis:

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the `k` values ensures that each bet can be scaled to a common multiple, which is crucial for the problem’s requirement.
- **Bet Calculation**: The bets are calculated as `m / k[i]` which ensures that the return for each winning outcome is strictly greater than the total bet.
- **GCD Calculation**: The GCD is used to normalize the bets to the smallest possible integers while maintaining the required property.
- **Validation**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf` to determine if a valid distribution of bets is possible.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets for each test case or determine that no such distribution is possible. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
