Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around Sasha's ability to guarantee that he can reach any number of coins `n` given the rules of the casino. The key parameters are:
- `k`: The multiplier for the bet in case of a win.
- `x`: The maximum number of consecutive losses allowed.
- `a`: The initial number of coins Sasha has.

The strategy involves placing bets in such a way that Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue increasing his coins indefinitely.

### Strategy

To ensure Sasha can reach any `n` coins, the strategy revolves around the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` consecutive times. After `x` consecutive losses, Sasha must still be able to recover and start betting again.

Let's denote `s` as the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses and continue increasing his coins.

### Calculation of `s`

The minimum number of coins `s` can be calculated as follows:
- After the first loss, Sasha has `s - 1` coins.
- After the second loss, Sasha has `s - 1 - 1` coins.
- After the third loss, Sasha has `s - 1 - 1 - 1` coins.
- ...
- After `x` losses, Sasha has `s - x` coins.

To recover from `x` losses, Sasha needs to be able to place a bet and win enough to recover his losses and continue betting. The minimum bet after `x` losses is 1 coin, and the maximum bet he can place is `s - x` coins.

After winning, the coins should be enough to cover the previous losses and still allow for further betting. This means:
- After winning, Sasha should have enough coins to place the next bet.

The formula for `s` can be derived as:
\[ s = 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 + \ldots \text{(x times)} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ s = 1 + x + x \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor \]

However, the program uses a simpler approximation:
\[ s = 1 + \sum_{i=0}^{x-1} \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

This approximation can be simplified to:
\[ s = 1 + x + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor \cdot x \]

The program iteratively calculates this value until it stabilizes.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins `s` required to guarantee that Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses and continue increasing his coins. The program then checks if the initial number of coins `a` is at least `s`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. For each test case, read the values `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. Initialize `s` to 1.
3. Iterate `x` times, updating `s` as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
4. Compare `a` with `s` and print "Yes" if `a >= s`, otherwise print "No".

### Correctness Check

The program's logic is based on the iterative calculation of the minimum number of coins `s` required to recover from `x` consecutive losses. The iterative approach ensures that the value of `s` stabilizes to the correct minimum value.

Given the problem constraints and the iterative approach, the program correctly determines whether Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`.

### Conclusion

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
