Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each list contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `x` is 0.**
