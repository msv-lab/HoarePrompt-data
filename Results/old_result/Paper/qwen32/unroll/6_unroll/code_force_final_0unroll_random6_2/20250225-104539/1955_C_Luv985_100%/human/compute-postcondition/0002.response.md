In this case, the `while` loop condition is `while T:`. This loop will execute as long as `T` is a non-zero value. Given that `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `T` will always be non-zero in this range, meaning the loop can certainly execute one time.

Since the loop condition `T` is guaranteed to be true given the constraints, no adjustments are needed to the state of `T` for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, we simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
