Reasoning:
The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the execution summary. The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the number of possible final configurations for the given chessboard state. According to the execution summary, `func_1` always returns the value 25, regardless of the input `n`. This behavior does not match the expected functionality of the program, which should compute the number of valid configurations based on the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already made.

The problem requires calculating the number of ways to place rooks on an n x n chessboard after k moves, considering the rules for valid moves and the mirroring behavior of the computer. The function `func_1` should implement a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of configurations correctly, but it does not do so.

Given the incorrect behavior of `func_1`, the program cannot produce the correct output for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
