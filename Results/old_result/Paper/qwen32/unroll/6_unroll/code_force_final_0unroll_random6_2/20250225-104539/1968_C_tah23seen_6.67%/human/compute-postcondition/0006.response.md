Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers where each integer is between 1 and 500, and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list `arr`. The function returns a list `ans` where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]` is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i + 1]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]` to ensure it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
