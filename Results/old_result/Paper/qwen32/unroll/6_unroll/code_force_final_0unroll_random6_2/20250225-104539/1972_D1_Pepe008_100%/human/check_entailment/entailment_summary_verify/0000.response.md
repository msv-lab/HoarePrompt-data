Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). Here's the code again for reference:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

### Function Summary Recap
The function reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\). It then calculates a value `suma` based on these inputs and outputs `suma - 2` for each test case.

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment states that the code is incorrect due to:
1. Flawed logic for calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).
2. Incorrect adjustment by subtracting 2 at the end.
3. Irrelevant conditions in the code.

### Detailed Analysis
Let's analyze the logic in the provided code:
- The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1)` suggests an attempt to iterate over possible values of \(b\), but the variable names and the logic inside the loop are confusing.
- The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not relevant to the problem.
- The final adjustment `suma - 2` is not explained and does not align with the logic needed to solve the problem.

### Correctness Verification
To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that the code accurately counts the number of pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. The correct approach would be to iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition directly:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness for all cases.

### Conclusion
The original code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the provided code.

Final: **False**
