Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. 

The main issue is that the function `func_1` is not properly considering the cost of bribing multiple people in sequence. The current implementation only considers the cost of bribing a single person and the immediate cost of bribing people between the current position and the target position, but it does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people to reach the desired position.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
Input:
```
1
5 3
7 3 6 9 1
4 3 8 5 2
```

Expected Output:
```
10
```

Explanation:
- Kirill starts at position 6.
- To reach position 3, he can bribe the person at position 5 for 1 coin, and then bribe the person at position 4 for 9 coins, but he can also bribe the person at position 4 for 9 coins and then bribe the person at position 3 for 6 coins, and the person at position 2 for 3 coins, but the optimal way is to bribe the person at position 5 for 1 coin, then the person at position 4 for 9 coins, and the person at position 3 for 6 coins, but the optimal way is to bribe the person at position 5 for 1 coin, then the person at position 4 for 9 coins, and the person at position 3 for 6 coins, but the optimal way is to bribe the person at position 5 for 1 coin, then the person at position 4 for 5 coins, and the person at position 3 for 3 coins, which totals to 10 coins.

However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate this and may return an incorrect result.

### Why the current implementation is incorrect:
The current implementation only considers the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and the minimum cost of bribing any person between `j` and `i` (i.e., `min(a[i], b[i])`), but it does not correctly accumulate the costs when bribing multiple people in sequence.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a priority queue to always bribe the person with the minimum cost first, or using dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
