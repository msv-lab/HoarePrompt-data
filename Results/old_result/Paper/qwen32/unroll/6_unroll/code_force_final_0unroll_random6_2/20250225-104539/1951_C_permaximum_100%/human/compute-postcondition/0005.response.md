The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tickets_bought`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). Since `k` is at least 1, `tickets_bought` being 0 ensures that the loop can execute the first time.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices), `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**
