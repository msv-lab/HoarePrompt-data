Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\). It then attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a loop over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\). The logic inside the loop is complex and involves calculations that do not seem to directly address the problem's requirements.

### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, calculates a value `suma`, and outputs `suma - 2`.

### Detailed Evaluation:
Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Loop and Calculation Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - The calculation `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is used to determine some value `x`.
   - The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is checked, which seems incorrect and unnecessary.
   - The value `x` is added to `suma` if the condition is met.
   - The final result is `suma - 2`.

2. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic inside the loop does not seem to directly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The subtraction of `2` from `suma` at the end is arbitrary and does not logically follow from the program's logic.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done using nested loops, but given the constraints, an optimized approach is necessary to avoid TLE.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the first test case from the example:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1` (since the only pair is \((1, 1)\) and \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)).

Let's run the program with this input:
- The loop will iterate over \(i\) from 1 to 1.
- The calculation `(1 - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1` results in `1`.
- The condition `(1 - 1 * (1 - 1)) % 1 ** 2 == 0 and 1 * (1 - 1) % 1 ** 2 == 0` is true.
- `suma` will be incremented by 1.
- The final result will be `1 - 2 = -1`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The logic and calculations within the loop are incorrect and do not lead to the right solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.
