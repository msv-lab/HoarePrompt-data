Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 50,000 and `k` is between 1 and the floor of `n/2`. It also accepts an array `a` consisting of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. The function performs some operation based on these inputs and returns a result.**
