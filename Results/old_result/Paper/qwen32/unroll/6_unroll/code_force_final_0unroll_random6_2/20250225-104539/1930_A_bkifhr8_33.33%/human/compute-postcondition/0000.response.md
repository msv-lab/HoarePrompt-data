The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This value is then assigned to the variable `t`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive. The code does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000)**.
