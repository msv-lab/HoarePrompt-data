### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine a distribution of bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back for each winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation**:
   - The function `lcm(l)` calculates the least common multiple of the list `l`. This is done by iteratively computing the LCM of the current result and the next element in the list using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Bet Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k`.
   - It then calculates the bets by dividing the LCM by each multiplier `k[i]`, resulting in a list `a` where each element `a[i]` is `prod // k[i]`.
   - The sum of these bets is computed and stored in `sumo`.

4. **Validation and Output**:
   - If `sumo` (total of all bets) is greater than or equal to `prod` (LCM of multipliers), it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets as a space-separated string.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **LCM and Bet Distribution**:
  - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the total bet `sumo` is less than the product of the multipliers if a valid distribution exists.
  - The bets are calculated such that for each outcome `i`, the received coins `k[i] * a[i]` equal the LCM. Since `sumo` is the sum of `a[i]`, the condition `sumo < prod` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the received coins for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - When all multipliers are the same, the LCM equals the multiplier, and the bets would be all `1`. If `n * 1 >= prod`, it correctly returns `-1`.
  - When multipliers are different, the LCM is larger, and the bets are distributed such that the total bet is less than the received coins for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine a valid distribution of bets or conclude that no such distribution exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
