You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    ABABB

    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, `ac` and `bc` will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the corresponding string of length 5, but these values will not be retained outside the loop as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The variable `t` and the input strings remain unchanged.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: For each of the t test cases, `ac` and `bc` will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the corresponding string of length 5, but these values will not be retained outside the loop as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The variable `t` and the input strings remain unchanged. If the current value of `ac` is greater than the current value of `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine which letter, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in each of the given strings of length 5. The program should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of one such string.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that iterates `t` times. For each iteration (each test case), it reads a string `s` of length 5.

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - Inside the loop, it initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. These are used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively in the current string.
   - It then iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is 'A', it increments `ac`. Otherwise, it increments `bc`.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After the inner loop (which processes one string), the program checks if `ac` is greater than `bc`.
   - If `ac` is greater, it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

### Issues in the Program
The main issue with the program is that it incorrectly places the comparison and print statements outside of the loop that processes each test case. As a result, the program only compares the counts of the last test case and prints the result for all test cases.

### Corrected Program
To fix the program, the comparison and print statements should be inside the loop that processes each test case. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        # Move the comparison and print statements inside the loop
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

# func()  # Uncomment this line to run the function
```

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle multiple test cases and only outputs the result for the last test case.

Correctness: **False**
