### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if there exists a template string `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, while string `c` does not. The matching rules are:
- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be the same as the i-th letter of the template.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template.

However, the provided function `func_1` does not create a template string. Instead, it checks if there is any position `i` where neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches `c[i]`. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to create a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c` at that position. If no such position exists, it returns 'NO'.

This approach is correct because:
- If there is any position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]`, then we can set the i-th letter of the template to be the uppercase version of `c[i]` (or any other uppercase letter that is not `c[i]`), making `a` and `b` match the template at that position while `c` does not.
- If for all positions `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]`, then it is impossible to create such a template.

Thus, the logic in `func_1` correctly implements the solution to the problem.
