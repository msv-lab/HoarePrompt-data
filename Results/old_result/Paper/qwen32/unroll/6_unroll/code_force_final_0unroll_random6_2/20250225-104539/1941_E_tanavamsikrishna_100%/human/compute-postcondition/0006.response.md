To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved.

### Context and Variables:
- `total_costs` is a list that contains the sums of every possible `k`-sized contiguous sublist within another list called `costs`.
- The task is to find and print the minimum value in the `total_costs` list.

### Explanation:
1. **Definition of `total_costs`**: 
   - `total_costs` is constructed by summing up all possible contiguous sublists of size `k` within the `costs` list.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `k = 2`, then `total_costs` would be `[1+2, 2+3, 3+4]` which simplifies to `[3, 5, 7]`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Value**:
   - The `min(total_costs)` function call will return the smallest value in the `total_costs` list.
   - For the example above where `total_costs = [3, 5, 7]`, the minimum value is `3`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every possible k-sized contiguous sublist within the costs list)**
