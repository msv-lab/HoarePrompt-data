In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if and only if `m` is greater than 0. The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `ans` is a set containing `x`. However, according to the instructions, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only `m` (since `_` is a throwaway variable and not a state variable).

Let's break it down:

- `m` controls whether the loop will execute. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop will execute.
- `n` and `x` are not directly involved in the loop's execution, so we do not need to adjust them.
- `ans` is a set containing `x` and is not part of the loop head, so we do not need to adjust it either.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `m` to be greater than 0.

State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing `x`**
