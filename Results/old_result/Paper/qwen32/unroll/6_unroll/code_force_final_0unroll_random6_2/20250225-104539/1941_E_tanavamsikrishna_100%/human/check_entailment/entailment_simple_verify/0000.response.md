### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Understanding:

The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges over `n` rows of a river grid, where the cost of installing a support at cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. Supports must be installed at the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

#### Program Analysis:

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed breakdown of each function based on the annotations:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Purpose**: Calculate the cost of building a bridge on a single row.
    - **Logic**:
        - Initialize the first element of `row` to `1` (cost of placing a support at the first column).
        - Increment the next `d-1` elements by `2` (incorrect initialization).
        - Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to a certain point.
        - For each element from index `d` to the end, update the cost based on the minimum cost within the last `d+1` elements.
        - Return the last element of `row` as the total cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Purpose**: Read input, calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
    - **Logic**:
        - Read the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
        - Read the grid of depths.
        - Calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`.
        - Compute the total cost for every possible `k` consecutive rows and find the minimum.

#### Issues in the Program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Incorrect Initialization**: The first `d` elements are incremented by `2`, which is incorrect. The cost should be calculated based on the actual depth values plus `1`.
    - **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to find the minimum cost within the last `d+1` elements, but the logic does not ensure that supports are placed at the first and last columns with the correct cost.
    - **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation does not correctly account for the constraints and the actual depth values.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Cost Aggregation**: The costs calculated by `func_1` are summed directly for `k` consecutive rows, which is incorrect if `func_1` does not provide the correct cost for each row.

#### Correctness:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the issues mentioned above. The function `func_1` does not properly handle the constraints and the cost calculation, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
