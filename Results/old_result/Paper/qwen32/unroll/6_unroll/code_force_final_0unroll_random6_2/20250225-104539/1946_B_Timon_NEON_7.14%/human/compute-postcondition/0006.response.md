The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. This new segment is formed by concatenating `max_segment` with the end index of the array `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `new_segment` is an empty list.
- `max_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the end index of the last segment.
- `segments_variants` is a list of all considered segments.
- `max_sum` is -1.

After executing the code:
- `segments_variants` will now include the new segment, which is `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [sum of the last segment, end index of the last segment]; `segments_variants` is a list of all considered segments including the new segment `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1.**
