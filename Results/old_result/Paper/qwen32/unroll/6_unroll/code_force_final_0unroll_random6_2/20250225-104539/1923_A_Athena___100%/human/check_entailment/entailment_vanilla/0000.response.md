Let's go through the program step by step and analyze if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:

The goal is to move chips such that they form a single block with no free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required is the number of free cells within the range of the chips' positions.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the list `a` which represents the cells (0 for free, 1 for a chip).

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing free cells from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()` respectively. This step is correct because these free cells do not contribute to the number of moves needed to consolidate the chips into a single block.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program then iterates over the remaining cells in `a` and counts the number of free cells (cells with value `0`).
   - This count is stored in `res` and represents the number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

- **Handling Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
  - By removing leading and trailing free cells, the program effectively focuses only on the range of cells that contain chips or free cells that need to be filled by moving chips.

- **Counting Free Cells:**
  - The number of free cells within the range of the chips is the correct measure of the minimum number of moves required to consolidate the chips into a single block.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to consolidate the chips into a single block. It handles all edge cases, including when all chips are already in a single block or when there are no chips at all (though the problem specifies at least one chip per test case).

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
