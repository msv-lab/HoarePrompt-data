You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .
