Postcondition: **`flag` is `True`; `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the count of consecutive `val` elements at the end of the array.**

In natural language, this means that after entering the if condition, `flag` is `True`, `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, `val` remains as the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` still represents the count of consecutive `val` elements at the end of the array.
