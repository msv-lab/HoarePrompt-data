Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440. Each of the following t lines contains a string s of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", where hh is a two-digit integer from "00" to "23" representing the hour, and mm is a two-digit integer from "00" to "59" representing the minute. The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format; day is 'AM'.**

Explanation: The value of `day` has been set to `'AM'`. The initial state of `t` and the format of the strings `s` remain unchanged.
