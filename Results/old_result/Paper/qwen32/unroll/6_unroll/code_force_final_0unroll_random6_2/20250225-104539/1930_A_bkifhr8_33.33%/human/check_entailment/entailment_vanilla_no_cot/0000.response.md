Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements:**
   - The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. They will always try to remove the first element twice because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` both evaluate to `0`. This will lead to an `IndexError` after the first removal because the list will be shorter.

2. **Logic Error in Loop:**
   - The condition `if len(lst) != 2` is not appropriate for controlling the loop. The loop should run exactly `n` times, each time removing two elements from the list and adding the minimum of those two to the score.

3. **Inefficient Approach:**
   - The program does not sort the list, which is necessary to maximize the score. The optimal strategy is to always pick the two smallest remaining numbers in each move to maximize the sum of the minimums.

4. **Unnecessary Else Block:**
   - The `else` block is unnecessary because the loop will naturally terminate when `n` iterations are completed. The `else` block is only executed when the loop completes normally, which is always the case here.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to always pick the two smallest numbers
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):  # Iterate in steps of 2
            ans += lst[i]  # Add the smaller of the two numbers (which is lst[i] after sorting)
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program sorts the list and then iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, always adding the smaller of each pair (which is the `i`-th element due to sorting) to the score. This ensures that the score is maximized.
