### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `day` is initialized to 'AM', which is the correct default for times in the first half of the day.
   - `n` is read as the number of test cases.

2. **Loop through each test case**:
   - For each test case, the input string `s` in the format "hh:mm" is split into hours `h` and minutes `m` using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

3. **Conversion logic**:
   - If `h` (hour) is `0`, it is converted to `12` and `day` is set to 'AM'. This handles the midnight case correctly.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it is converted to the corresponding 12-hour format by subtracting `12` from `h` and setting `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is `12`, it remains `12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. This handles the noon case correctly.
   - If `h` is between `1` and `11`, `day` is set to 'AM', and `h` remains unchanged. This handles the morning cases correctly.

4. **Output**:
   - The converted time is printed in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" using `print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)`. The `:02d` ensures that the hour and minute are always two digits, with leading zeros if necessary.

5. **Edge cases**:
   - Midnight (`00:00`) is correctly converted to `12:00 AM`.
   - Noon (`12:00`) is correctly converted to `12:00 PM`.
   - All other times are correctly converted based on whether they fall in the AM or PM period.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conversion rules and edge cases for converting times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
