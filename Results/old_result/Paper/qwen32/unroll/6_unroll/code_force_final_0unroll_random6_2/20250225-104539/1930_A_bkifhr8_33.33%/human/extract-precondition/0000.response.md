Precondition: **The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. It also receives a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.**
