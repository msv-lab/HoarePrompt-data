To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to carefully analyze the behavior of the code given the initial state. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list.
   - `max_segment` is [0, 0].
   - `segments_variants` is an empty list.
   - `max_sum` is -1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates through each element of `arr`.
   - If `new_segment` is not empty:
     - If the current element `arr[i]` is negative:
       - Compare `max_segment[0]` with `new_segment[0]`.
       - Append the larger segment with the index `i - 1` to `segments_variants`.
       - Update `max_segment` if `new_segment` was larger.
       - Reset `new_segment` and adjust `max_segment[0]` to include the negative element.
     - If the current element `arr[i]` is non-negative:
       - Add the element to both `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]`.
   - If `new_segment` is empty:
     - If the current element `arr[i]` is non-negative:
       - Initialize `new_segment` with the current element and its index.
     - Add the element to `max_segment[0]`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `new_segment` will be empty if the last element was negative or if the list ended with a non-negative segment.
   - `max_segment` will contain the sum and the end index of the last segment processed.
   - `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that were considered as potential `max_segment` during the loop.
   - `max_sum` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.

Given the initial state and the logic of the loop, we can infer the final state:

- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `new_segment` will be empty if the last element was negative or if the loop ended with a non-negative segment.
- `max_segment` will have the sum of the last segment and its end index.
- `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that were considered during the loop.
- `max_sum` remains -1 as it is not modified.

Let's express the output state in the required format:

Output State: **arr is a list of integers; new_segment is an empty list; max_segment is [sum of the last segment, end index of the last segment]; segments_variants is a list of all considered segments; max_sum is -1.**
