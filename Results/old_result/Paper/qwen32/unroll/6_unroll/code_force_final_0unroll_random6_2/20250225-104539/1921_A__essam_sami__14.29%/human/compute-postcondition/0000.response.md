The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state includes this integer `t` and the description of the subsequent input for each test case, which consists of coordinates of the corners of a square.

After executing the line `t = int(input())`, the variable `t` is assigned the integer value read from the input. The rest of the input (the coordinates for each test case) is not yet processed by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value read from the input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); the input for each test case (four lines with coordinates of the corners of a square) is still to be processed.**
