You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: The variable `fnd` holds the count of times the intersection count was at least `k` for each test case, and all other variables remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of times the intersection count of the first `m` elements of `a` with `b` is at least `k` as the elements of `a` are cyclically shifted.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of subsegments of length `m` in array `a` that are "good".
- A subsegment `c` of length `m` is considered "good" if its elements can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a sliding window approach with the help of the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **First Window**:
   - It initializes `cnt_aa` as a `Counter` for the first `m` elements of `a`.
   - It initializes `cnt_bb` as a `Counter` for all elements of `b`.
   - It calculates the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` (stored in `D`), which represents the common elements between the first window of `a` and `b`.
   - The remaining elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` after the intersection are stored in `E` and `C` respectively.
   - It calculates the total number of matching elements (`tot`) and checks if it is greater than or equal to `k` to initialize the count `fnd`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - For each subsequent element in `a` (from `m` to `n-1`), it updates the `Counter` by removing the element that is sliding out of the window (`out_aa`) and adding the element that is sliding into the window (`in_aa`).
   - It updates the `D`, `E`, and `C` counters accordingly.
   - It recalculates the total number of matching elements (`tot`) and checks if it is greater than or equal to `k` to update the count `fnd`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments, it prints the count of good subsegments.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases correctly:

1. **Initial Window**:
   - The program correctly initializes the `Counter` for the first `m` elements of `a` and compares it with `b`.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program correctly updates the `Counter` as it slides the window across `a`.
   - It ensures that the intersection (`D`) and the remaining elements (`E` and `C`) are updated accurately.
   - It correctly checks if the total number of matching elements is greater than or equal to `k` for each window.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All Elements Match**: The program should correctly identify when all elements of a subsegment match `b`.
   - **No Elements Match**: The program should correctly identify when no elements of a subsegment match `b`.
   - **Single Element Subsegment**: The program should work correctly for `m = 1`.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: The program should handle multiple test cases independently.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly implement the sliding window approach and handle the problem requirements. It efficiently updates the `Counter` and checks the conditions for each subsegment.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
