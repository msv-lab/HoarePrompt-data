### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described, using the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Reading Input:
- The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and processes them accordingly.
- `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` are helper functions to read different types of input: a single line, an integer, and a list of integers, respectively.

#### Processing Each Test Case:
- For each test case, the program reads `n` (number of players), `m` (number of throws), and `x` (initial player with the ball).
- It initializes a set `ans` containing the initial player `x`.

#### Processing Each Throw:
- The program iterates over each throw, reading the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
- For each player `q` in the current set `ans` (representing possible players with the ball after the previous throws):
  - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the player who would receive the ball if thrown clockwise to the set `temp`.
  - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the player who would receive the ball if thrown counterclockwise to the set `temp`.
- The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

#### Handling Modulo Operation:
- The modulo operation `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` is used to determine the new player after a throw.
- The program checks for the special case where the result of the modulo operation is `0`. If so, it replaces `0` with `n` because player numbers are from `1` to `n`.

#### Output:
- After processing all throws, the program outputs the number of possible players with the ball and their numbers in increasing order.

### Verification Against the Problem Requirements:

1. **Correct Direction Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles all possible directions ('0', '1', '?') for each throw. When `c` is '0', it only considers the clockwise direction, when `c` is '1', it only considers the counterclockwise direction, and when `c` is '?', it considers both directions.

2. **Set Usage:**
   - The program uses a set to keep track of all possible players that could have the ball after each throw, ensuring that no duplicates are counted. This is crucial for correctness, as it avoids double-counting players who could reach the same position through different sequences of throws.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied to handle circular movement in the game. The expressions `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly compute the new player's position in a circular manner.

4. **Handling Modulo Result 0:**
   - The program correctly handles the special case where the modulo operation results in `0` by replacing it with `n`. This is necessary because player numbers are from `1` to `n`, and `0` is not a valid player number.

5. **Output Requirements:**
   - The program outputs the correct number of possible players with the ball and their numbers in increasing order. This matches the problem's output requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each throw, and outputs the correct number of possible players with the ball and their numbers in increasing order.

**Final: True**
