The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day (`m`), the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and the price per ticket for each sale day. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the daily ticket limits and prices.
