Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in handling the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, the handling of the hour `12` in both AM and PM is incorrect.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if h == 0:
    h = 12
    day = 'AM'
elif h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'PM'
    if h == 12:
        day = 'AM'
```

The issue arises in the `else` block. When `h` is `12`, the program incorrectly sets the day to `PM` before checking if `h` is `12`. This results in the hour `12` being incorrectly marked as `PM` instead of `AM`.

Here is a counterexample demonstrating the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
12:00
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12:00 PM
```

**Actual Output:**
```
12:00 AM
```

To fix this, the code should be modified to correctly handle the hour `12` in both AM and PM:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

With this modification, the program should correctly handle all edge cases, including `00:00`, `12:00`, and any other valid 24-hour time.
