Output State: **`nums` is a list where the first element is `0` and all other elements are `1`; `ls` is `len(nums) - 1`; `nw` is `True`; `cw` is `True`.**

In simple terms, the list `nums` remains unchanged with its first element as `0` and all other elements as `1`. The variable `ls` still holds the value `len(nums) - 1`, and the variable `nw` remains `True`. Additionally, the variable `cw` is now set to `True`.
