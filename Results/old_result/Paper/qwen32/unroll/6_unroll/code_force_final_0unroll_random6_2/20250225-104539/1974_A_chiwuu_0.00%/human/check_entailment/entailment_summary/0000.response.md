Reasoning:

Let's break down the program's logic and verify if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the icons.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculation of 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons as `b * 4` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).
   - It then calculates how many full 5x5 screens are needed to fit these 2x2 icons. It does this by dividing `b * 4` by 15 (the total number of cells in a 5x5 screen) and rounding up to account for any remaining cells that would require an additional screen.
   - If `t * 15 - b * 4` is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), it means the remaining space in the screens can accommodate all 1x1 icons, and no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons by dividing the remaining number of 1x1 icons by 15 and rounding up.

3. **Output**: The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

The logic seems to be correct based on the problem description. The program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons first, then checks if the remaining space in those screens can fit the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - `b * 4 = 4` cells needed for 2x2 icons.
  - `4 / 15` requires 1 screen.
  - Remaining space in the screen is `15 - 4 = 11` cells, which can fit 1x1 icons.
  - Total screens needed: `1`.

- **Test Case 2**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
  - `b * 4 = 8` cells needed for 2x2 icons.
  - `8 / 15` requires 1 screen.
  - Remaining space in the screen is `15 - 8 = 7` cells, which can fit 7 1x1 icons.
  - Total screens needed: `1`.

- **Test Case 3**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
  - `b * 4 = 16` cells needed for 2x2 icons.
  - `16 / 15` requires 2 screens.
  - Remaining space in the screens is `30 - 16 = 14` cells, which can fit 12 1x1 icons.
  - Total screens needed: `2`.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens for each test case in the example.

Correctness: **True**
