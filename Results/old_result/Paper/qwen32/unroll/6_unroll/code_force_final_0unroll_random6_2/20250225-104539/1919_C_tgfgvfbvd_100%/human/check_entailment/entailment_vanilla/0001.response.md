Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` in such a way that the sum of penalties `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The penalty of a subsequence is the number of indices `i` such that `b[i] < b[i + 1]`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to achieve this by iterating through the array and maintaining two variables `a` and `b`, which seem to represent the last elements of subsequences `s` and `t` respectively. The variable `c` is used to count the number of times a new element is added to subsequence `s` (or `t`), which could be interpreted as an attempt to count the transitions that contribute to the penalty.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `a` and `b`**:
   - The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to `float('inf')`. This is reasonable for the first comparison.
   
2. **Swapping `a` and `b`**:
   - The line `if a > b: (a, b) = (b, a)` ensures that `a` is always the smaller of the two. This logic could be used to ensure that the sequences are built in a non-decreasing manner.
   
3. **Updating `a` and `b`**:
   - The program then checks if the current element `l[x]` can be added to either `a` or `b`:
     - If `l[x] <= a`, it updates `a`.
     - If `l[x] > a` but `l[x] <= b`, it updates `b`.
     - If `l[x] > b`, it updates `a` and increments `c`. This implies that the current element is starting a new increasing sequence, thus contributing to the penalty count.
   
4. **Counting Transitions**:
   - The variable `c` is incremented when an element is added to `a` and `a` is updated to a larger value than `b`. This suggests that the program is trying to count the number of times a new sequence starts, which can be seen as a penalty.

### Correctness:
The logic of the program is flawed. The program attempts to count the number of transitions that contribute to the penalty, but it does not correctly represent the splitting of the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` with minimal penalties.

The program does not actually split the array into two subsequences but rather counts the number of times it encounters an element that is larger than both `a` and `b`. This does not necessarily minimize the penalty, as it does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. It does not ensure that the array is split optimally to minimize the total penalty.

**Correctness: False**
