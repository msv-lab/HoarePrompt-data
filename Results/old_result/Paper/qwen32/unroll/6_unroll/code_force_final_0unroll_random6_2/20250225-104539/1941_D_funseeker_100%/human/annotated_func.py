#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1()`. Therefore, there are no preconditions to describe based on the variables in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is the next line of input from the standard input, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads the next line of input from the standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, and based on the provided code snippet, it seems to be an incomplete or placeholder function. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the variables in the function signature as there are none.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not take any input arguments. It implicitly relies on the function `func_1` to return a string that can be split into a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers derived from the space-separated string returned by `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no input arguments, calls `func_1` to obtain a space-separated string, converts this string into a list of integers, and returns this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer representing the number of throws made such that 1 <= m <= 1000, x is an integer representing the initial player number who throws the ball first such that 1 <= x <= n.

    #State: `ans` is a set of values generated by applying the transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations, based on `r` and `c` from `func_1()`. `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.

    #State: `ans` is a set of values generated by applying the transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations, based on `r` and `c` from `func_1()`. If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` includes the value `n` and excludes the value `0`. Otherwise, `0` is not in `ans`. `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of unique values in the set `ans` generated by the transformations)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted elements of `ans` (where `ans` is a set of values generated by applying `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` transformations to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations, with modifications based on the presence of `0` in the set)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the number of unique players who will throw the ball after `m` throws, starting from player `x` among `n` players, based on the rules provided by the inputs `r` and `c` for each throw. It also prints the sorted list of these unique player numbers.
