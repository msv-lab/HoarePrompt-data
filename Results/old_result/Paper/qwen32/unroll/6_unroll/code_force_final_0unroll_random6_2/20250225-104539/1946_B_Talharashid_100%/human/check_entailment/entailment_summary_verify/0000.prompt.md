You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = 0
        maxi = 0
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the input integers `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of `n` integers. The calculation involves finding a maximum sum of a subarray under certain conditions, applying a transformation involving `k`, and then taking the result modulo 1,000,000,007.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly k operations. The key issue lies in how the program calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved.

The program seems to be attempting to find the maximum subarray sum (using a variation of Kadane's algorithm) and then using that sum to calculate the final result based on the number of operations `k`. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to use the `k` operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3 3
-1 -2 -3
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Explanation for the counterexample:
- The optimal strategy is to insert the sum of an empty subarray (which is 0) three times. This does not change the sum of the array, which remains -1 - 2 - 3 = -6.
- Since the result can be negative, we need to take the result modulo 10^9 + 7, which is 999999991 (since -6 % 1000000007 = 999999991).
- However, the program will incorrectly calculate a positive value based on the maximum subarray sum (which is 0 in this case) and the number of operations, leading to an incorrect result.

The program does not handle cases where the maximum subarray sum is non-positive correctly, and it does not consider the optimal strategy for inserting subarray sums to maximize the total sum of the array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
