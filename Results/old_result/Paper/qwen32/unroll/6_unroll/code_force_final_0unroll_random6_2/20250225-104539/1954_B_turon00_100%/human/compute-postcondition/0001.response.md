In the provided code snippet, the loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` since it is the only one mentioned in the loop head.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Variable `t`:** The loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.
2. **Other Variables:** The variables `n` and `a` are defined inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop itself will execute. They are specific to each iteration of the loop.

Given that `t` is already described as an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, it is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
