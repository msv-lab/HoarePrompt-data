#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: For each of the t test cases, the output is a list of n integers where each integer is a power of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of k, padded with zeros if necessary to make the list length n.
#Overall this is what the function does:For each of the `t` test cases, the function takes two integers `n` and `k`, and outputs a list of `n` integers. The list contains powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, padded with zeros if necessary to ensure the list length is `n`.
