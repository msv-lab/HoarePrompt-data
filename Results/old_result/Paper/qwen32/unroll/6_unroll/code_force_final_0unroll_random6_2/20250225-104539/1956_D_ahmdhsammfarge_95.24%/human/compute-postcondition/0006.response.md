Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers and includes an additional operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`. The `ops` list now contains the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

In simpler terms: The variables `r` and `l` remain unchanged. The list `lst` remains unchanged. The list `ops` now includes an additional operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
