You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, the number of moves, and the moves themselves. A correct function definition would be `def func_1(test_cases)`, where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, and a list of `k` moves. Each move is a tuple of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. The precondition is that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, for each test case `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= n`, and each move `(r_i, c_i)` satisfies `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.

    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: [7, 25]

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Game Rules**:
   - You and the computer take turns placing rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - You place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (i.e., no two rooks in the same row or column).
   - After you place a rook at (r, c), the computer mirrors your move by placing a rook at (c, r), unless r = c, in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - We are given `k` moves that have already been made, and we need to find the number of different final configurations possible after all moves are finished.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of different final configurations possible after the game concludes, given `n` and `k` as well as the `k` moves already made.
   - The answer should be printed modulo 10^9 + 7.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Multiple test cases (up to 10^4).
   - Large board sizes (up to 3 * 10^5).
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the moves already made.

2. **Logic to Calculate Remaining Moves**:
   - For each move (r, c):
     - If `r != c`, then both `r` and `c` are occupied and can no longer be used, hence `n -= 2`.
     - If `r == c`, then only that row/column is occupied, so `n -= 1`.

3. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of different final configurations for a board of size `n` after all moves have been made.
   - It uses dynamic programming (DP) to compute the configurations:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an i x i board.
     - The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`.
     - The transition formula is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`, which is derived from considering the placement of the first rook and the subsequent configurations.
     - The result is computed modulo 10^9 + 7.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)` after adjusting `n` based on the moves already made.

### Verification

- The logic to adjust `n` based on the moves is correct.
- The DP function `func_1(n)` seems to correctly compute the number of configurations based on the problem's constraints and transition formula.
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently within the given constraints.

### Conclusion

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem according to the given requirements and constraints.

Reasoning: The program correctly parses the input, adjusts the board size based on the moves already made, and uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of possible final configurations. It handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct results modulo 10^9 + 7.

Correctness: **True**
