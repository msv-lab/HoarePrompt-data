To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` possible outcomes such that if any one of the outcomes wins, the player receives back more than the total amount of coins bet. Specifically, if the `i-th` outcome wins, the player should receive `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the `i-th` outcome. The total amount bet across all outcomes should be strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.

### Approach Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve this problem using the following steps:
1. **Compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM):** The function `func_1(a, b)` computes the LCM of two numbers using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`. The main function `func_2()` then computes the LCM of all `k_i` values.
2. **Determine Bet Amounts:** The code calculates `vprod` as the list of `den // k_i` for each `k_i`, where `den` is the LCM of all `k_i`. This step is intended to find a set of bets that might satisfy the condition.
3. **Check Feasibility:** The code then checks if the total amount bet, `sum(vprod)`, is less than the LCM (`den`). If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the `vprod` list as the bets.

### Flaws in the Approach
The approach taken by the code has several flaws:
1. **Incorrect Condition Check:** The condition `den - sum(vprod) <= 0` is incorrect. It should be checking if `sum(vprod) < k_i * x_i` for each `i`. The LCM (`den`) itself does not directly relate to the condition that the total bet must be less than the return for any winning outcome.
2. **Incorrect Bet Calculation:** The `vprod` calculation does not guarantee that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. It simply computes a fraction of the LCM divided by each `k_i`, which does not necessarily lead to a valid solution.
3. **No Guarantee of Solution:** Even if the condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` is satisfied, it does not guarantee that `sum(vprod) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

### Correctness
Given the flaws in the approach, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
