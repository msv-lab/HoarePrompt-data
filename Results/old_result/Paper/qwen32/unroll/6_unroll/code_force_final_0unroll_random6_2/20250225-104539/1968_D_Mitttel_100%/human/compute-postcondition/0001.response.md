The code snippet initializes a variable `mx` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`). Therefore, the output state is simply the initial state with the addition of `mx` being set to 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, and `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The length of the lists `a` and `p` is `n`, and `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). `mx` is 0.**
