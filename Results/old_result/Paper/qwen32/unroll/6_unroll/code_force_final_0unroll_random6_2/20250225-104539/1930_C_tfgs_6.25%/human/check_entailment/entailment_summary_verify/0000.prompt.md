You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It modifies each element of `a` by adding its 1-based index to it, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and then constructs a new list `ans` that includes all elements from the modified `a` and additional elements that fill gaps between consecutive elements in descending order, ensuring the total length of `ans` is `n`. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description in every potential case. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array `b` is flawed. The program attempts to add additional elements to `ans` that are not part of the set `S` and do not follow the rules of the problem.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Construction of `ans`**:
   - The program tries to add elements to `ans` that are not part of the set `S`. This is done in the loop that handles the `cnt` variable, which counts the number of duplicates and elements that were not added to `S` due to the set's uniqueness property.
   - The line `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` incorrectly adds elements that are not part of the set `S`. These elements should not be added to `ans` because they do not correspond to any `a_i + i` that was inserted into `S`.

2. **Handling of Duplicates**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each `a_i + i`. However, it does not correctly handle the insertion of elements into `S` and the construction of `b` based on the problem's rules.
   - The logic for adding elements to `ans` based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where all elements in `a` are the same or where the elements in `a` are such that the resulting set `S` has very few unique elements. In such cases, the additional elements added to `ans` can be incorrect.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input**:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
4 3 2
```

**Actual Output from the Program**:
```
4 3 2 1
```

In this case, the program incorrectly adds an additional element `1` to the output, which is not part of the set `S` and does not follow the problem's rules.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
