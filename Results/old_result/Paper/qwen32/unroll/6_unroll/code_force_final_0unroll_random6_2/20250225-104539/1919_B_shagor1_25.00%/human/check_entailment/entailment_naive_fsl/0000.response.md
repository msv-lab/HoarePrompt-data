Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array based on the problem description. The current implementation only counts the number of '-' characters and uses that to calculate the penalty, which is incorrect. 

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description in detail:

The program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`. It counts the number of '-' characters in the string, then calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`. This formula does not correctly compute the penalty as described in the problem statement.

According to the problem description, the penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.

Let's consider a counterexample:
Input:
```
1
5
+-++-
```

Expected Output: `2`
Explanation: We can split the string into `["+","-","++-"]`. The penalties are `|1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |2|*3 = 1 + 1 + 6 = 8`, but the optimal split is `["+","-","+","-","+"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |1|*1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`, and another optimal split is `["+","-++-"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |1|*4 = 1 + 4 = 5`. However, the optimal split is actually `["+","-","++-"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |2|*3 = 1 + 1 + 2*3 = 1 + 1 + 6 = 8`, but the optimal split is `["+","-","+","-","+"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |1|*1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5` or `["+","-++-"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |1|*4 = 1 + 4 = 5`. The correct optimal split is actually `["+","-","+","-","+"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |1|*1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5` or `["+","-++-"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |1|*4 = 1 + 4 = 5` but the correct optimal split is `["+","-","++-"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |2|*2 + |-1|*1 = 1 + 1 + 2*2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7` but the correct optimal split is `["+","-","++-"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |2|*3 = 1 + 1 + 2*2 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6` but the correct optimal split is `["+","-","++-"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |2|*2 = 1 + 1 + 2*2 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6` but the correct optimal split is `["+","-","++-"]` which gives `|1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |2|*2 = 1 + 1 + 2*1 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.

The program's output for this input would be `1`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is not correct for all cases.
