The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m` respectively. The initial state specifies the ranges for these variables, which remain valid after the code execution. The variable `s`, which is a string, and the integer `t` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; the string `s` is of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
