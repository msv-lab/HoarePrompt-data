Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly compute the minimum cost of installing supports for the bridges as per the problem description. There are several issues with the approach:

1. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`:** The `func_1` function attempts to calculate the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the constraints, particularly the distance `d` between supports and the requirement to place a support at both ends of the row.

2. **Heap Usage in `func_1`:** The use of a heap in `func_1` is not appropriate for solving the problem as described. The heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost, but it does not correctly account for the distance constraint `d` between supports.

3. **Cost Calculation in `func_2`:** The `func_2` function calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and then sums the costs for consecutive `k` rows to find the minimum total cost. However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution does not yield the correct result.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming to ensure that the distance constraint `d` is respected while calculating the minimum cost for placing supports in each row. Additionally, the solution should efficiently handle the large input size constraints.
