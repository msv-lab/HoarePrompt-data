Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally given the rules and Nene's strategy. The key to scoring points is to play a card that already has a matching card on the table. The provided program, however, does not implement any logic related to the game rules or optimal play strategy. Instead, it simply calculates the number of duplicate integers in each list of cards you have, which does not solve the problem as described.

The correct approach would involve simulating the game, considering the optimal moves for both players, and calculating the points accordingly. Since the provided program does not do this, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
