Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; test is an input integer.**

In this output state, `test` has been assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions for `t` and the ranges for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
