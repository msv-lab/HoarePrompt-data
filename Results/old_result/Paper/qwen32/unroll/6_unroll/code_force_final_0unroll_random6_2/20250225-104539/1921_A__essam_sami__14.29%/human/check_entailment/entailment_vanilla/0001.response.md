Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, which means we can determine the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates or the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two squared distances as the area of the square. This approach is flawed for the following reasons:

1. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points \((a, b)\) and \((e, f)\), and \((c, d)\) and \((g, h)\). However, these pairs of points are not necessarily adjacent corners of the square, so the distances calculated do not necessarily represent the side length of the square.

2. **Choosing the Smaller Distance**: Even if one of the calculated distances were a correct representation of the side length, the program chooses the smaller of the two distances. This is incorrect because both distances should be checked against the other possible side lengths (calculated using other pairs of points).

3. **Correct Approach**: To correctly determine the area of the square, we should:
   - Collect all x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
   - Find the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (which gives one possible side length).
   - Find the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates (which gives another possible side length).
   - The side length of the square is the larger of these two differences (since the sides are parallel to the axes, one of these differences will be the side length of the square).
   - The area of the square is the square of this side length.

### Correct Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the correct approach:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        coordinates = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coordinates.append((x, y))
        x_coords = [x for x, y in coordinates]
        y_coords = [y for x, y in coordinates]
        side_length = max(max(x_coords) - min(x_coords), max(y_coords) - min(y_coords))
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

# Call the function to execute the program
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the area of the square. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
