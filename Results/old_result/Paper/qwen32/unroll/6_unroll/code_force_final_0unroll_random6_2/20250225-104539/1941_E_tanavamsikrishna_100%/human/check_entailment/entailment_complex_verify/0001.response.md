To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic and behavior of the functions `func_1` and `func_2` using the annotated code and the problem description.

### Problem Analysis Recap
- **Objective:** Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid.
- **Constraints:**
  - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns (depth 0, cost 1).
  - Distance between adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
  - Cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

### Solution Analysis Recap
The solution involves two main functions:
1. **`func_1(row, d):`** Calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
2. **`func_2():`** Reads input, applies `func_1` to each row, and finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive bridges.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`
1. **Initialization:**
   - `row[0] = 1` (correct, cost of support at the first column).
   - `row[i] = row[i] + 2` for `i` in `1` to `d-1` (this is incorrect). The cost should be `row[i] + 1`, not `row[i] + 2`, because the cost of a support is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Heap-based Calculation:**
   - A min-heap is created from the first `d` elements of the row.
   - For each subsequent element in the row, the heap is used to find the minimum cost of placing a support such that the distance constraint is respected.
   - The heap is updated with the new cost and the current element.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`
1. **Input Reading:**
   - Reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - Reads the grid of river depths.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Applies `func_1` to each row to calculate the cost of installing supports for a single bridge on that row.
   - Sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum.

### Correctness Evaluation
1. **Initialization in `func_1`:**
   - The first element (`row[0] = 1`) is correct.
   - The next `d-1` elements should be `row[i] = row[i] + 1`, not `row[i] = row[i] + 2`. This is a critical error because it incorrectly inflates the cost of supports in the first `d` columns.

2. **Heap-based Calculation:**
   - The heap-based calculation seems correct in terms of logic, but the initial incorrect cost calculations will propagate incorrect results.

3. **Cost Calculation in `func_2`:**
   - The costs for each row are calculated using `func_1`, which contains an error.
   - The minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is found by summing up the costs and taking the minimum.

### Conclusion
The program contains a critical error in the initialization of the row costs in `func_1`. Specifically, the cost of supports in the first `d` columns is incorrectly inflated by 1, which leads to incorrect results. This error invalidates the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
