Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic for splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed.

Here are a few issues with the code:
1. The code only attempts to split a number once and only if the number is greater than the next number in the list. This is not sufficient because it does not account for the possibility of needing to split multiple numbers or splitting numbers that are not immediately followed by a smaller number.
2. The code does not handle the case where a number needs to be split into more than two digits correctly. For example, if the number is 123, it should be split into 1, 2, and 3, not just 1 and 23.
3. The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted, but the main loop only runs once per test case, which is insufficient to ensure that all necessary splits have been made.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:
Input:
```
1
3
30 2 10
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
```
Explanation:
- The number 30 can be split into 3 and 0.
- The number 10 can be split into 1 and 0.
- After splitting, the array becomes [3, 0, 2, 1, 0], which can be rearranged to [0, 0, 1, 2, 3] to be sorted.

However, the provided code will not handle this case correctly because it only attempts to split numbers once and only if they are greater than the next number in the list. In this case, it will not split 30 or 10, and thus will incorrectly determine that the array cannot be sorted.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
