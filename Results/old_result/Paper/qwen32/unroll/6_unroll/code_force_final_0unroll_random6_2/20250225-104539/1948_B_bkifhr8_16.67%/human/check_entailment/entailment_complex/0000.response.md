### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine whether it is possible to sort an array by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits. The program iterates through the array and, whenever it finds an element that is greater than the next element and is at least 10, it splits that element into its digits. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Inadequate Splitting**: The program only performs one split operation per pass through the array, and it does not handle the case where multiple splits are needed to achieve a sorted array. For example, if the array is `[123, 4]`, the program will only split `123` into `[1, 2, 3, 4]` in the first pass, but it does not handle the case where further splits are necessary to sort the array.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop only checks the current element against the next one and does not consider the possibility that the split operation might affect the order of elements further down the array. After a split, the array might need to be re-evaluated from the beginning.

3. **Lack of Iterative Splitting**: The program does not iterate through the array multiple times to ensure that all necessary splits are performed. It only makes one pass through the array, which is insufficient to handle all cases.

4. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if the list is sorted. However, it is called after a single pass through the array, which might not be sufficient to sort the array.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to correctly determine whether the array can be sorted by splitting elements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
