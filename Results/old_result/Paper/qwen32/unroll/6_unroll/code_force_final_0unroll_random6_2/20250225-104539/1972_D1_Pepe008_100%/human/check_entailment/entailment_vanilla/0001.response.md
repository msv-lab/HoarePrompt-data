Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:
1. **Incorrect Loop and Calculation Logic**:
   - The program iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\). This is not the correct approach to find all valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The calculation `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent checks do not correctly determine the valid pairs.
   - The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is incorrect and does not serve the intended purpose.
2. **Incorrect Output Adjustment**:
   - The subtraction of `2` from `suma` at the end is arbitrary and does not logically follow from the program's logic.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done using nested loops, but given the constraints, an optimized approach is necessary to avoid TLE (Time Limit Exceeded).

### Correctness of the Given Program:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement. The logic and calculations within the loop are incorrect and do not lead to the right solution.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.
