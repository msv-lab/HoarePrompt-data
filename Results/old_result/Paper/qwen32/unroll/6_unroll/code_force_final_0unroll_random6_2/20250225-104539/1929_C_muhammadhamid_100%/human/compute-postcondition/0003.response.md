Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the values of `k` and `x`, and then prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The constraints are that `k` is between 2 and 30, `x` is between 1 and 100, and `a` is between 1 and 10^9. The number of test cases can be up to 1000.**
