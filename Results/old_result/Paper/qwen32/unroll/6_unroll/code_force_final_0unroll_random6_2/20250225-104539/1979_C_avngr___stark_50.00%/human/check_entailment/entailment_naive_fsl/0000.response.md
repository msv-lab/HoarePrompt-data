Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k` by multiplying all `k` values together.
2. It then calculates the coefficients `c` as the LCM divided by each `k` value.
3. The code calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of these coefficients and normalizes them by dividing each coefficient by the GCF.
4. Finally, it checks if the sum of the normalized coefficients is less than the normalized LCM. If not, it outputs `-1`.

However, the normalization step is unnecessary and does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the minimum required return for any winning outcome. In fact, the problem requires that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the minimum `k_i * x_i` for any `i`.

Here is a counterexample where the code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```
or any other valid distribution where the sum of the bets is less than the minimum return for any winning outcome (which is `2` in this case). For example, `1 1 1` results in a total bet of `3` and each winning outcome returns `2 * 1 = 2`, which is not greater than `3`. However, a valid distribution could be `1 1 0` or `0 1 1` etc.

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
-1
```
The code incorrectly outputs `-1` because the sum of the normalized coefficients is not less than the normalized LCM.

To fix this, the code should not normalize the coefficients and should directly check if the sum of the coefficients is less than the minimum `k_i * x_i` for any `i`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = reduce(lcm, k)
    c = [m // ki for ki in k]
    if sum(c) >= m:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for ci in c:
            print(ci, end=' ')
        print('')
```

This corrected code calculates the LCM and the coefficients correctly and checks if the sum of the coefficients is less than the LCM, ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the minimum return for any winning outcome.
