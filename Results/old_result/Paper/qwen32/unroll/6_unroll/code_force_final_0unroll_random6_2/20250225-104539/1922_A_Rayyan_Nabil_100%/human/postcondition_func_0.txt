The function accepts three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20. It checks if there is any position `i` where neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches `c[i]`. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such position exists, it returns 'NO'.
