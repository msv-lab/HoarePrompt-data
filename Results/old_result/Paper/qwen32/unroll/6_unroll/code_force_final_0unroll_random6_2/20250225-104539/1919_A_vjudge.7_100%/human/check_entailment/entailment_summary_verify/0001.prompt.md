You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, and prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem's requirements.

The game revolves around the total number of coins (a + b) that Alice and Bob have combined. The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on whether the total number of coins is odd or even.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: Alice starts the game with `a` coins, and Bob starts with `b` coins. The total number of coins is `a + b`.

2. **Turns and Moves**: Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then they must remove one coin from the wallet they are currently using. The game continues until one player can't make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty).

3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring that he always has a valid move until the end. This is because the game will end when the last coin is taken, and since the total number of coins is even, Bob will take the last coin and win.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always make the last move, ensuring that she wins. This is because the game will end when the last coin is taken, and since the total number of coins is odd, Alice will take the last coin and win.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`).
   - It checks if the sum of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`). If the result is `0`, the sum is even; otherwise, it's odd.
   - It prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

The program correctly implements the logic described above. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
