The code snippet `last = [-1]` simply assigns a new list containing the integer `-1` to the variable `last`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, or `left`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`, `left` is a list containing a single element, `0`, `last` is a list containing a single element, `-1`.**
