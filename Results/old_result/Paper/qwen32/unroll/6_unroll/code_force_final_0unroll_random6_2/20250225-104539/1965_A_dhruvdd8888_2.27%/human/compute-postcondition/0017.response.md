Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any explicit parameters. It reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it evaluates the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. The function either prints "Alice" or "Bob" to the console based on the evaluation, but it does not return any value. If "Alice" is printed, the function returns `None`. If "Bob" is printed, the function also returns `None`.**
