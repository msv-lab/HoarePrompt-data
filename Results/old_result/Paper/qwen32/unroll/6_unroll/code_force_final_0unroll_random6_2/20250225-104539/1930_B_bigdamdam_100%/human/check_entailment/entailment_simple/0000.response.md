### Reasoning:

The given program aims to generate a permutation for each test case such that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) (where \(1 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\)) satisfy the condition that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's approach:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and for each test case, it reads the integer \(n\).

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - An array `p` of length `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The program fills the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of `p` with decreasing values starting from `n` and decrementing by 2 each time.
   - The program fills the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) of `p` with increasing values starting from `1 + n % 2` and incrementing by 2 each time.

3. **Output**: The resulting permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The approach ensures that the values at even indices are decreasing and the values at odd indices are increasing.
  - This arrangement minimizes the chances of \(p_i\) dividing \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) dividing \(p_{j+1}\) because the values at even and odd indices are quite different and not in a direct sequential or proportional relationship.
  - Specifically, the highest values are placed at even indices, and the smallest values are placed at odd indices, which helps in avoiding the divisibility condition.
  
- **Verification with Example**:
  - For \(n = 4\), the permutation generated is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. Here, there are no pairs \((i, j)\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).
  - For \(n = 3\), the permutation generated is `[3, 1, 2]`. Again, there are no pairs \((i, j)\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
