### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

The key insight is that Alice and Bob are playing optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`, and Bob will try to minimize it. However, the strategy of the players does not affect the final MEX value when considering the optimal moves. The MEX value is determined by the frequency of elements in `arr`. Specifically, the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once.

Hereâ€™s how the provided program works:
1. **Frequency Calculation**: It calculates the frequency of each element in `arr` using a list `freq` where `freq[i]` represents the count of `i` in `arr`.
2. **Finding the MEX**: It iterates through the `freq` list and finds the smallest index `i` such that `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1. This index `i` is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

The provided program correctly calculates the MEX based on the frequency of elements in `arr`. The commented-out functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) are unrelated to the problem and do not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, given that both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
