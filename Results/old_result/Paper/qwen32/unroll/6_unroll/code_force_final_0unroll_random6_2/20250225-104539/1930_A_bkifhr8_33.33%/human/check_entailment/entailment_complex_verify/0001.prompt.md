You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. It also receives a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: ans_f is a list containing the sums of the minimum values of each pair of integers for each test case.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The sums of the minimum values of each pair of integers for each test case have been printed, and the list `ans_f` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list and prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it is correct based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - The list is split into a list of strings and then converted to integers.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Maximum Score:**
   - The program aims to calculate the maximum score by performing the move `n` times.
   - In each move, it selects two integers, adds the minimum of the two to the score, and removes these two integers from the list.
   - The program uses a loop to perform the move `n` times.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the length of the list is not equal to 2, but this check is incorrect. The loop should run exactly `n` times, and the list should be reduced by 2 elements in each iteration.
   - The removal of elements is also incorrect. The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` does not correctly remove the first two elements. Instead, it should use `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)` to remove the first two elements in each iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - The program stores the score for each test case in the list `ans_f` and prints each score after all test cases are processed.

**Key Issues:**
- The loop for performing the moves should ensure that it runs exactly `n` times.
- The removal of elements from the list should be done correctly to ensure that the first two elements are always removed in each iteration.
- The condition `if len(lst) != 2` is unnecessary and incorrect for the logic of the problem.

**Correctness:**
Given the issues with the logic and the way elements are removed from the list, the program is not correct. The program does not guarantee that it will always select the optimal pairs to maximize the score.

Correctness: **False**
