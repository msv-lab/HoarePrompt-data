#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, the number of moves, and the moves themselves. A correct function definition would be `def func_1(test_cases)`, where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, and a list of `k` moves. Each move is a tuple of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. The precondition is that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, for each test case `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= n`, and each move `(r_i, c_i)` satisfies `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: [7, 25]
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns 25
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and always returns the value 25, regardless of the input `n`.
