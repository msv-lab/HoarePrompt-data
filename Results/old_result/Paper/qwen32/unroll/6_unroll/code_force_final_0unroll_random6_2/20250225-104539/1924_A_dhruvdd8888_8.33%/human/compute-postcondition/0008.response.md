Postcondition: **`t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. `n` is still an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. `k` is still an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26. `m` is still an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. `s` is the same input string. `us` is still a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list containing the last characters of each sequence of `k` distinct characters from `us` found in `s`. `ps` is the count of such sequences of `k` distinct characters, and `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
