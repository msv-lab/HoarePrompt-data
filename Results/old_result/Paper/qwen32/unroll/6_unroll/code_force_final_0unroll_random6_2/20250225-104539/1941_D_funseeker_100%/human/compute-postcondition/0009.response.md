To determine what will be printed by the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, we need to understand the contents of the set `ans` based on the given initial state.

### Understanding the Initial State:
1. **`ans`**: This is a set of values generated by applying transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations.
2. **`r` and `c`**: These are values generated by `func_1()`, but their exact values are not specified.
3. **`n`, `m`, `x`**: These are constants that remain unchanged throughout the process.
4. **Set `ans` modifications**:
   - If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` includes the value `n` and excludes the value `0`.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`, then `0` remains excluded.

### Determining the Output:
The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the elements of the set `ans` in sorted order. The exact elements of `ans` depend on the transformations applied and the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c`.

### Explanation:
- The set `ans` is generated by repeatedly applying transformations to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations.
- The transformations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` generate new values that are added to the set `ans`.
- If `0` is generated during these transformations, it is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`.
- The final set `ans` is then sorted and printed.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values in `ans`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the set `ans`:

Output: **sorted elements of `ans` (where `ans` is a set of values generated by applying `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` transformations to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations, with modifications based on the presence of `0` in the set)**
