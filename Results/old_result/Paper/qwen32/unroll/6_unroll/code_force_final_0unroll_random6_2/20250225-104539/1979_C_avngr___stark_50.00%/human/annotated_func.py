#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: hcf is the GCD of the number of test cases and all the subsequent elements in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the GCD of the number of test cases and all the subsequent elements in the list `numbers`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements are integers. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list, including the first element `t`.
