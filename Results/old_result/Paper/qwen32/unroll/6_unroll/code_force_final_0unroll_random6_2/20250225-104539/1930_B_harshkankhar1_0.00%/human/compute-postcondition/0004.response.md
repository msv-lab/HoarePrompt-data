Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices of this list, and prints the modified list. This process is repeated for multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases not exceeding 1000 and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases not exceeding 100,000.**
