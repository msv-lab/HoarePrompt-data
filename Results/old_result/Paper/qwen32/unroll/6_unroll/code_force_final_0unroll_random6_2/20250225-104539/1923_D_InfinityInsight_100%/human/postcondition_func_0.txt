The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `a` and an integer `x` as input. It returns -1 if `x` is less than 0. If `x` is non-negative, it returns the index of `x` in the list `a` plus one if `x` is found in the list. If `x` is not found, it returns an index from the function `bl(a, x)`, which does not correspond to the value `x`.
