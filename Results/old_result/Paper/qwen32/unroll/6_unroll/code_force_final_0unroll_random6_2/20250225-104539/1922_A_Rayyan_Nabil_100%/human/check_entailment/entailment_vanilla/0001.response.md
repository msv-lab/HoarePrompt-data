Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
1. Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Conditions
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be the same as the i-th letter of the template `t`.
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template `t`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function checks if there exists at least one position `i` where the i-th characters of `a` and `b` are different from the i-th character of `c`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases, reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

### Correctness of the Solution

Let's consider the logic of `func_1`:
- The function iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
- If such a position exists, it means that we can choose the i-th character of the template `t` to be uppercase (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`), thus making `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not.
- If no such position exists, then it is impossible to find a template `t` that satisfies the conditions, and the function returns 'NO'.

### Conclusion

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not. The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
