To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `l` and `r`.

Given the condition `while l <= r:`, the loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

From the provided state:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 (since `n - 1` would be 0, and `0 <= 0` is true).

Since `n` is already constrained to be between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\), no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure that the loop executes. The initial values of `l` and `r` already satisfy the condition `l <= r`.

Therefore, no changes are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0**
