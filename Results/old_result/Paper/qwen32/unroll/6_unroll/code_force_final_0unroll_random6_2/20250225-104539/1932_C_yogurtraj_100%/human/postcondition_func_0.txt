For each test case, the function computes a list `y` of length `n` based on the given integers `n` and `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. The list `y` is computed such that each element is derived from the rules involving the characters in `s` and the corresponding values in `a`, modulo `m`. The function prints the list `y` for each test case.
