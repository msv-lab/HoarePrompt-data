Functionality: **The function determines the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the scores calculated from a permutation and an array. It returns 'Bodya' if Bodya has a higher score, 'Sasha' if Sasha has a higher score, and 'Draw' if both have the same score. The duration of the game `k` is provided but not used in the decision-making process.**
