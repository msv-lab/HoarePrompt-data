The given Python code snippet initializes a dictionary `lst` using `defaultdict(list)`. This means `lst` is a dictionary where each key's default value is an empty list.

The initial state includes several variables and conditions, but only `lst` is directly affected by the given code snippet. Here’s the updated state after the code execution:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer and t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and it is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the node where the stone is initially put, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

In simple terms, after executing the given code snippet, `lst` is initialized as a dictionary with list as the default factory, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
