To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `l <= r`. The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones involved in the loop condition.

Given:
- `l` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l <= r` must be true. Since `l` is initialized to 0 and `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, the condition `0 <= n - 1` will be true as long as `n` is at least 1 (which it is, since `1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute the first time. The initial state already satisfies the condition.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of the array, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
