Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. The current implementation calculates the penalty by simply counting the number of '+' and '-' characters and then using a formula that does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty as described in the problem statement.

To solve the problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that takes into account the optimal splits based on the cumulative sums would be required. The given solution does not implement such a strategy and hence is incorrect.
