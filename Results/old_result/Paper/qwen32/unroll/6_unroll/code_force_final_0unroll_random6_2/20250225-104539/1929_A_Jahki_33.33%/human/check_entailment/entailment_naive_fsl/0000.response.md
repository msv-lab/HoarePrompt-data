Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in its approach to determining the maximum beauty of the array. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and returns `True` if it is, which leads to the incorrect conclusion that the beauty of the array is `0`. However, the goal is to maximize the beauty, which can be achieved by arranging the elements in a way that maximizes the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The provided program does this correctly when `func_1` returns `False`, but it incorrectly returns `0` when the array is already sorted, which is not necessarily the case with maximum beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
2
1 2
2
2 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
1
1
```
However, the current program will output `0` for the first test case because the array `[1, 2]` is already sorted, and `func_1` returns `True`.

To fix this, the check for whether the array is sorted should be removed, and the beauty should always be calculated based on the sorted array. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version will always compute the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
