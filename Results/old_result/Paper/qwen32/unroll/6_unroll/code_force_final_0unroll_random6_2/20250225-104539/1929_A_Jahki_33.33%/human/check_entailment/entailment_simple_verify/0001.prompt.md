You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

    2 1

Output

    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]

        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program is intended to find the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

Here's the breakdown of the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
3. It checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function.
4. If the array is already sorted, it prints `0` because the beauty of a sorted array is `0`.
5. If the array is not sorted, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
6. It prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

The logic of the program is correct. Sorting the array in non-decreasing order will indeed maximize the beauty because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized in this order.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The `func_1` function is used to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if so, it returns `True`, but the program incorrectly prints `0` when `func_1` returns `True`. This is correct because the beauty of a sorted array is indeed `0`. But the logic in the `else` block is also correct as it calculates the beauty of the sorted array. The program does not have any other logical errors.

Thus, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
