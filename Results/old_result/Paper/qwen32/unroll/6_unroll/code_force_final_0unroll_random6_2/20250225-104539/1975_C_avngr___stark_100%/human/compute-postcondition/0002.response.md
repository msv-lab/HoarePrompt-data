Output State: **For each test case, the output is the maximum value among the medians of all contiguous subarrays of length 3 in the list `a`. If `n` is 2, the output is the minimum value in the list `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` and `a` are re-assigned for each test case but are not retained after the loop.**
