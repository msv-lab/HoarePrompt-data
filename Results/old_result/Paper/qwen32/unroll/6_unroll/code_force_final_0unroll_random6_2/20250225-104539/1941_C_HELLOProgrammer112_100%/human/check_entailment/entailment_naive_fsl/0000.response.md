Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program simply counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" and then computes `x + y - z`. However, this approach does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
11
pppiepieeee
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation: The string "pppiepieeee" contains two occurrences of "pie". To make it beautiful, you can remove the second 'p' and the second 'e' from the second "pie", resulting in "ppieeeee" which does not contain "pie" or "map". The program would incorrectly output `2` for "pie" occurrences minus `0` for "mapie" occurrences, but it doesn't account for the optimal removal of characters.

The program needs a more sophisticated approach to handle overlapping substrings and find the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful. A dynamic programming approach or some form of greedy algorithm might be necessary to solve this problem correctly.
