The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `input` is assigned the value of the input read from standard input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the space-separated values from the input; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
