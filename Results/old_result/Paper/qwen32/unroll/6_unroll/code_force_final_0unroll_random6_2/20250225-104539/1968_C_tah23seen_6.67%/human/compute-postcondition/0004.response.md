The code modifies the last element of the `ans` list by setting it to the sum of the second-to-last element of the `ans` list and the last element of the `arr` list. The other elements of `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and each subsequent `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]` if necessary, except `ans[-1]` is now `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
