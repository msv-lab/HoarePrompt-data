You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:

    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the number of elements in the array a (where a_2, a_3, ..., a_n are the elements of arr). The function is called for each test case, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and each subsequent `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]` if necessary.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i + 1]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description in all cases. Let's analyze the code and identify a potential issue:

The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the way the array `ans` is constructed in the function does not guarantee this property for all inputs.

Here is an example where the provided code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:** Any `a` such that `a[1] % a[0] == 1` and `a[2] % a[1] == 1`. For example, `2 3 4` or `2 5 6` are valid outputs.

**Actual Output from the code:**
```
2 3 4
```

While `2 3 4` is a valid output, let's consider another input:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 3
```

**Expected Output:** Any `a` such that `a[1] % a[0] == 2` and `a[2] % a[1] == 3`. For example, `3 5 8` or `4 6 9` are valid outputs.

**Actual Output from the code:**
```
3 5 8
```

This output is correct for this particular case, but let's consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 4 1
```

**Expected Output:** Any `a` such that `a[1] % a[0] == 2`, `a[2] % a[1] == 4`, and `a[3] % a[2] == 1`. For example, `3 5 9 10` or `4 6 10 11` are valid outputs.

**Actual Output from the code:**
```
3 5 4 9
```

This output is incorrect because `4 % 5` is not equal to `4`. The correct value for `ans[2]` should be `9` (since `9 % 5 == 4`), and then `ans[3]` should be `10` (since `10 % 9 == 1`).

Thus, the code does not always produce the correct output for the given problem description, and therefore it is incorrect.
