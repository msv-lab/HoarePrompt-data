### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to determine if a list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. The program's logic has a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program only checks if the current element is greater than the next element and greater than 10 before splitting it. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the list can be sorted by only splitting elements in this manner. For example, in the case of `[12, 28, 5]`, the program would not split `12` because `12` is not greater than `28`. Instead, it should attempt to split any element that is at least 10 and see if the resulting list can be sorted.

2. **Lack of Comprehensive Checking**: After attempting a split, the program immediately checks if the list is sorted. However, it should continue attempting to split elements until no more splits can be made or the list is sorted. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if the list is sorted. However, it is only called after the program attempts to make a single split, which is insufficient.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the list can be sorted by splitting elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
