Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array `a`; `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array `a`; `bodya_score` is the value returned by `calculate_score(PB)`; `sasha_score` is the value returned by `calculate_score(PS)`. Additionally, `bodya_score` is less than or equal to `sasha_score`, and `sasha_score` is not greater than `bodya_score`.**
