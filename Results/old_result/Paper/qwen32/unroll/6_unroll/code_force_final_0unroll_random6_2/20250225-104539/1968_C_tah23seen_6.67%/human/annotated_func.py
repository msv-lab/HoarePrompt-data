#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the number of elements in the array a (where a_2, a_3, ..., a_n are the elements of arr). The function is called for each test case, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and each subsequent `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]` if necessary.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i + 1]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` of integers, each between 1 and 500, and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in `arr`. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i + 1]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
