### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to understand if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid Representation**: The river is represented as a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns, where `a_{i,j}` is the depth of the cell at row `i` and column `j`.
2. **Bridge Construction**: Rudolf needs to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows. Each bridge is built on a single row, and supports must be installed according to the rules:
   - A support must be installed in the first and last columns (i.e., at `(i,1)` and `(i,m)`).
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i,j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
3. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Compute the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row with the given constraints.
   - **Logic**:
     - Initialize the first `d` elements of the row.
     - Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to the current position.
     - For each cell beyond the `d`-th position, find the minimum cost within the last `d+1` positions, add the current cell's cost plus one, and push the new cost into the heap.
     - Return the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost for the entire row.
   - **State**: The function processes each row individually and returns the minimum cost for that row.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Compute the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Logic**:
     - Read input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - Read the grid of depths.
     - Compute the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - Calculate the sum of costs for every possible `k`-sized contiguous sublist within the list of row costs.
     - Print the minimum sum of these costs.
   - **State**: The function processes the entire grid, computes row costs, and finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Correctness:
- **Function `func_1`**: The logic for computing the minimum cost for a single row seems correct. It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost within the last `d+1` positions and correctly updates the cost for each cell.
- **Function `func_2`**: The logic for computing the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is also correct. It computes the cost for each row and then finds the minimum sum of `k` consecutive row costs.

Given the provided test cases and the logic of the program, it appears that the program correctly computes the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
