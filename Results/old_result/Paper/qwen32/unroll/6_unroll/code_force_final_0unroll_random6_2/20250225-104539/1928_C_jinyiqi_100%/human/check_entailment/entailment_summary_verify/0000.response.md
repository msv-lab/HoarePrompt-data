Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or incorrect.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of valid `k` values such that, given a position `n` and a number `x`, `x` appears at position `n` in the sequence defined by the "first-k-th" settlement pattern.

### Key Points:
1. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. The pattern is: `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2`.
3. For a given `n` and `x`, we need to determine if `x` appears at position `n` for some `k`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program uses a helper function `func_1` to find the divisors of a number. It then checks certain conditions involving the divisors to determine valid `k` values.

### Function Summary:
- `func_1(x)`: Returns a list of divisors of `x`, sorted such that larger divisors come first, followed by smaller divisors in reverse order.

### Provided Program Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
```

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Divisor Usage**: The divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are used, but the logic to determine valid `k` values from these divisors is not clear or correct.
2. **Conditions**: The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` do not directly relate to finding valid `k` values.
3. **Logic for `k`**: The logic to check if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` and if it is greater than or equal to `x` is not correct.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves iterating over possible `k` values and checking if `x` appears at position `n` in the sequence defined by `k`.

### Example of a Correct Implementation:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for k in range(x, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k:
            if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 1 - (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == x:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid `k` values for the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
