Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it is correct based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - The list is split into a list of strings and then converted to integers.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Maximum Score:**
   - The program aims to calculate the maximum score by performing the move `n` times.
   - In each move, it selects two integers, adds the minimum of the two to the score, and removes these two integers from the list.
   - The program uses a loop to perform the move `n` times.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the length of the list is not equal to 2, but this check is incorrect. The loop should run exactly `n` times, and the list should be reduced by 2 elements in each iteration.
   - The removal of elements is also incorrect. The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` does not correctly remove the first two elements. Instead, it should use `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)` to remove the first two elements in each iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - The program stores the score for each test case in the list `ans_f` and prints each score after all test cases are processed.

**Key Issues:**
- The loop for performing the moves should ensure that it runs exactly `n` times.
- The removal of elements from the list should be done correctly to ensure that the first two elements are always removed in each iteration.
- The condition `if len(lst) != 2` is unnecessary and incorrect for the logic of the problem.

**Correctness:**
Given the issues with the logic and the way elements are removed from the list, the program is not correct. The program does not guarantee that it will always select the optimal pairs to maximize the score.

Correctness: **False**
