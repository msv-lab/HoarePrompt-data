The code snippet `n, m, x = func_3()` assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `x`. The initial state of `n`, `m`, and `x` is overridden by the values returned from `func_3()`. The precondition for the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` is no longer relevant because they are reassigned.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.**
