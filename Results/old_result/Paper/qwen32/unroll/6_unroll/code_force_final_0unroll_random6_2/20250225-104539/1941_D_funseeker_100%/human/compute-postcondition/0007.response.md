Postcondition: **`ans` is a set of values generated by applying the transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations, based on `r` and `c` from `func_1()`. If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` includes the value `n` and excludes the value `0`. Otherwise, `0` is not in `ans`. `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.**
