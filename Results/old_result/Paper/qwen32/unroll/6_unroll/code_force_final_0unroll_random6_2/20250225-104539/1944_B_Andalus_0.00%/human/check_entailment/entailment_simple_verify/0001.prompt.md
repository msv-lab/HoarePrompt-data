You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem is to find two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that:
1. `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of the array `a`.
2. `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of the array `a`.
3. The bitwise XOR of elements of `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements of `r`.

### Program Analysis

The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a` of length `2n`. The array `a` is then split into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`.

The program then uses the following strategy to construct `l` and `r`:
1. **Identify Duplicates and Singles:**
   - For the left half `lft`, it identifies elements that appear twice (`ldb`) and elements that appear once (`sng`).
   - For the right half `rgt`, it identifies elements that appear twice (`rdb`).

2. **Constructing `l` and `r`:**
   - For `l`, it first tries to add pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` until it reaches the required length `2k`. If it still needs more elements, it adds single elements from `sng`.
   - It repeats the same process for `r` using `rdb` and `sng`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` as two separate lines.

### Correctness Analysis

Let's consider the correctness of this approach:
- **Identifying Duplicates and Singles:**
  - The program correctly identifies elements that appear twice and elements that appear once in both halves of the array.
  
- **Constructing `l` and `r`:**
  - By adding pairs of duplicate elements, the XOR of these pairs will be `0` (since `x ^ x = 0`).
  - The remaining elements, if any, are single elements that will be added to `l` and `r` in the same order.
  - Since the problem guarantees that every integer from `1` to `n` occurs exactly twice in the array `a`, the XOR of all elements in `a` will be `0`.
  - Therefore, the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal if the program ensures that the same number of each element is included in both `l` and `r`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs `l` and `r` by ensuring that the same number of each element is included in both halves. The XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal because the program ensures that pairs of duplicate elements are added to both `l` and `r`, and any remaining single elements are also added to both `l` and `r`.

Thus, the program is correct for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
