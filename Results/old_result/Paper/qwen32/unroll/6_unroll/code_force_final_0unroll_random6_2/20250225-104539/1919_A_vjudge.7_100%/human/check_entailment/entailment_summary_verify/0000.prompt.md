You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5
    
    11 9
    
    83 91
    
    1032 9307
    
    839204 7281
    
    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, and prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description. The key part of the problem revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of coins in both wallets. If the sum of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially boils down to who will be the last to make a move, which depends on the parity of the total number of coins.

Let's break down the logic of the provided code:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. **Sum Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the sum of coins in both wallets (`a + b`).
3. **Parity Check**: It checks if the sum is even using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1 == 0`). If the result is 0, the sum is even, and it prints "Bob". If the result is 1, the sum is odd, and it prints "Alice".

### Analysis:
- **Even Sum**: If the sum of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob wins. This is correctly handled by the code.
- **Odd Sum**: If the sum of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice wins. This is also correctly handled by the code.

### Testing with Example Cases:
Let's verify the code with the provided example cases:

1. **Input**: `1 1`
   - Sum: `1 + 1 = 2` (Even)
   - Output: `Bob`

4. **Input**: `4 5`
   - Sum: `4 + 5 = 9` (Odd)
   - Output: `Alice`
   - Expected: `Alice` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `11 9`
   - Sum: `11 + 9 = 20` (Even)
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

6. **Input**: `83 91`
   - Sum: `83 + 91 = 174` (Even)
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

7. **Input**: `1032 9307`
   - Sum: `1032 + 9307 = 10339` (Odd)
   - Output: `Alice`
   - Expected: `Alice` (Correct)

8. **Input**: `839204 7281`
   - Sum: `839204 + 7281 = 846485` (Odd)
   - Output: `Alice`
   - Expected: `Alice` (Correct)

9. **Input**: `1000000000 1000000000`
   - Sum: `1000000000 + 1000000000 = 2000000000` (Even)
   - Output: `Bob`
   - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

10. **Input**: `53110 2024`
    - Sum: `53110 + 2024 = 55134` (Even)
    - Output: `Bob`
    - Expected: `Bob` (Correct)

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets. It handles all the given example cases correctly and does not seem to have any logical errors for the provided problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
