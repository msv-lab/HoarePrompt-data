The only variable in the loop head is `T`, which is the loop variable used in `range(t)`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variables `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 <= `k_i` <= 20**
