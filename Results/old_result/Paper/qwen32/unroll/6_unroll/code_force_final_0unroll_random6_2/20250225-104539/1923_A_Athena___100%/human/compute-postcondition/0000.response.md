Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. There is at least one `a_i` equal to 1 in each test case.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, and it remains within the range of 1 to 1000. The other variables and conditions provided in the initial state remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
