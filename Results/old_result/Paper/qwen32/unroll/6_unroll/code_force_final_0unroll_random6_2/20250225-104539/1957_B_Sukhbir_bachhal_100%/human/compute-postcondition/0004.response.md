The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `n` is not equal to 0, which means the loop can already execute. No adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `n` is not equal to 0, `position` is 0**
