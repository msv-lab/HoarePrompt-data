To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code within the loop for each test case. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - For each test case, the values of `n` and `k` are read.
   - A list `lst` of `2n` integers is read, where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice.

2. **List Splitting and Sorting:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted.

3. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles:**
   - `ldb` and `rdb` are lists that store the elements that appear twice in `lft` and `rgt`, respectively.
   - `sng` is a list that stores the elements that appear only once in `lft`.

4. **Printing Output for Left and Right Halves:**
   - For each half (`lft` and `rgt`), the code prints elements from `ldb` and `sng` until `k` elements have been printed.
   - Elements from `ldb` are printed in pairs.
   - Elements from `sng` are printed individually.

5. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The above steps are repeated for each of the `T` test cases.

Since the code does not modify the initial values of `T`, `t`, or `n` (except for the loop variable `_`), and since the lists `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are recalculated for each test case, the final output state will be the printed results for all test cases.

The output state can be described as the sequence of printed elements for each test case, which are determined by the values of `n`, `k`, and the contents of `lst`.

Given that the code only prints elements and does not modify the input values or any other global state variables, the output state is simply the printed results. Therefore, the output state is best described as the sequence of printed elements for all test cases.

Output State: **The sequence of printed elements for all test cases, as determined by the values of `n`, `k`, and the contents of `lst` for each test case.**
