### Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to determine whether a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the list, `n`, and the list of integers, `list1`.

2. **Processing the List:**
   - The program iterates through the list starting from the second element (index 1).
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one (`list1[p - 1] > list1[p]`) and the previous element is greater than or equal to 10 (`list1[p - 1] > 10`), the program attempts to split the previous element into its digits.
   - The previous element is removed from the list and replaced by its digits (using integer division and modulo operations).

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing the list, the program calls the function `func_1(lst)` to check if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The `func_1(lst)` function sorts the list and compares it with the original list. If they are the same, the list is sorted, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the result from `func_1(lst)`, the program prints "Yes" if the list can be sorted, otherwise it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
- The main issue with the program is that it only considers splitting elements when the current element is smaller than the previous one, and the previous one is greater than or equal to 10. This approach is too restrictive and may miss cases where splitting other elements is necessary to achieve a sorted list.
- The program does not guarantee that all elements greater than or equal to 10 are split in a way that results in a sorted list. It only attempts to split the first element that violates the sorted order, which may not be sufficient.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the list can be sorted by splitting elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
