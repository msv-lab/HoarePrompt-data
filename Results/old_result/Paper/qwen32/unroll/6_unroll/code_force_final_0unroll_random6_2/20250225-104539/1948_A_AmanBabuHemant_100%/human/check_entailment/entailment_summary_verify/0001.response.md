Let's carefully analyze the given problem description, the program code, and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters.
- A special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The output should be "NO" if no such string exists, or "YES" followed by the string if it does.

### Key Observations:
- The pattern "AAB" can be used to create special characters. In "AAB":
  - The first 'A' is special.
  - The second 'A' is not special.
  - The 'B' is special.
- Therefore, each "AAB" contributes 2 special characters.
- This means `n` must be even to have exactly `n` special characters.

### Program Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
- If `n` is even and less than or equal to 100, it outputs 'YES' followed by a string of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
- If `n` is odd or the resulting string would be longer than 200 characters, it outputs 'NO'.

### Program Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Check for Even `n`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters because each "AAB" contributes 2 special characters.
   - This is correctly implemented with the condition `if n % 2:`.

2. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program constructs the string using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - This ensures that the number of special characters is exactly `n` when `n` is even.

3. **String Length Constraint:**
   - The program checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200.
   - Since `n` is at most 50, and each "AAB" is 3 characters long, the maximum length of the string is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the 200-character limit.
   - Therefore, the condition `if len(s) < 200:` is always true for valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It correctly identifies when no valid string can be constructed and constructs a valid string when possible, ensuring the number of special characters is exactly `n` and the string length is within the required limit.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
