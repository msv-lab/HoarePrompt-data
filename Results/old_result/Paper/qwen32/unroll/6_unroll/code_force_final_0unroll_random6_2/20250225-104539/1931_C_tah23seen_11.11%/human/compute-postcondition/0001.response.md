Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= n, and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1.**

In natural language: The list `arr` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` is still 0. The variable `j` has been assigned the value of the length of `arr` minus 1.
