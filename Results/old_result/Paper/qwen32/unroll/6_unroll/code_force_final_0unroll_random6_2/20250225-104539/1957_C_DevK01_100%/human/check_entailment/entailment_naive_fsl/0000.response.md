Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
Upon reviewing the provided program, there are a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `n` Reduction:**
   - The code reduces `n` by 2 when `a != b` and by 1 when `a == b`. This is not entirely correct because each rook placed reduces the number of available rows and columns for future placements, but the logic does not accurately reflect the problem's constraints.
   - For example, if you place a rook at (1, 2), it blocks row 1 and column 2. The next move should consider the reduction in both dimensions, but the code only reduces `n` by 2 or 1, which is not sufficient to handle all cases correctly.

2. **Incorrect Implementation of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the number of possible final configurations based on the remaining `n`. However, the dynamic programming logic does not correctly account for the problem's constraints.
   - The problem involves placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, and the configurations need to be calculated based on the remaining rows and columns, which is not accurately handled by the current implementation.

3. **Lack of Proper Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` becomes very small after several moves, or when `k` is equal to `n`, meaning no more moves can be made.

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:

```
1
4 2
1 2
2 3
```

- Initially, `n = 4`.
- After the first move (1, 2), `n` should be reduced by 2 (since row 1 and column 2 are blocked), so `n = 2`.
- After the second move (2, 3), `n` should be reduced by 2 again (since row 2 and column 3 are blocked), so `n = 0`.

However, the code will incorrectly reduce `n` by 2 each time, leading to an incorrect final value of `n` and therefore an incorrect calculation of the number of configurations.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
