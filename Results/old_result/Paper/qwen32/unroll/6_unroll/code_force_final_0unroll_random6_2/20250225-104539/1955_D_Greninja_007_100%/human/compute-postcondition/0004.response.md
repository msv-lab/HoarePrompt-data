Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `a[:m]`; `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements common between `ca` and `cb`; `sm` is a value such that `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
