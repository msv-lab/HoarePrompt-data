The code snippet provided initializes a variable `neg` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. The output state will reflect this initialization.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'; `neg` is 0.**
