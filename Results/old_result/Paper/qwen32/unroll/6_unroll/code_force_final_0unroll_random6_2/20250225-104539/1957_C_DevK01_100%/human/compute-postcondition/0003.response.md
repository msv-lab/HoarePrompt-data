The provided code snippet is attempting to return the last element of a list named `dp`. However, in the initial state, the list provided is named `[7, 25]`, which does not match the list `dp` mentioned in the code. Since the list `dp` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume that `dp` is intended to be the list `[7, 25]` based on the context.

Thus, `dp[-1]` refers to the last element of `dp`, which is `25`.

Output State: **The program returns 25**.
