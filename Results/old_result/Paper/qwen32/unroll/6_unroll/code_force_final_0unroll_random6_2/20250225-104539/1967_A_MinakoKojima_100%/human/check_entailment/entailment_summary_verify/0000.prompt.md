You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = a[0]
        res = n - 1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        ans += res
        ans_list.append(ans)
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `a`, and prints this result. The final state of the program is that it has printed the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score by rearranging the cards to form permutations of [1, 2, ..., n]. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans` and `res`:** 
   - `ans` is initialized with the smallest number of cards (`a[0]`), which is not correct. The goal is to maximize the number of complete permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].
   - `res` is initialized with `n - 1`, which is also not clear why this is the initial value for the remaining cards needed to form permutations.

2. **Logic for Distributing Coins (`k`):**
   - The logic for distributing coins to make all counts of cards equal is flawed. The program attempts to make all counts equal by distributing coins, but the way it does this does not ensure the maximum number of permutations.
   - The program does not correctly account for the number of permutations that can be formed after distributing the coins.

3. **Final Calculation of Score:**
   - The final calculation of the score (`ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`) is incorrect. This formula does not correctly compute the number of valid permutations that can be formed after distributing the coins.

4. **Handling of Remaining Coins:**
   - The handling of remaining coins (`k != 0`) after making all counts equal is also incorrect. The program does not correctly distribute these remaining coins to maximize the number of permutations.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 5
1 2 3
```
The correct output should be `5`. Here's why:
- We start with counts [1, 2, 3].
- We can buy 2 more cards of type 1 and 3 more cards of type 2 to make the counts [3, 5, 3].
- Now, we can form the following permutations of length 3: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].
- However, since we only need to count contiguous subarrays of length 3 that are permutations, and we have enough cards to form these permutations, the maximum score is 5.

The provided program will not correctly compute this score.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] that can be formed by rearranging the cards after buying additional cards with the given coins. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
