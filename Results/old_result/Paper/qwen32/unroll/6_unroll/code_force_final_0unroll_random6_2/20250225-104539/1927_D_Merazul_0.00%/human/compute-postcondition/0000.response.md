The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning a map object of these integers. This does not change the initial state of the variables `n`, `a`, `q`, and the query boundaries `l` and `r`. However, it introduces a new variable `R` that can be used to read input in the specified format.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`. The next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array. The following line contains an integer `q` (1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the next `q` lines contains two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ `l` < `r` ≤ `n`) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning a map object of these integers.**
