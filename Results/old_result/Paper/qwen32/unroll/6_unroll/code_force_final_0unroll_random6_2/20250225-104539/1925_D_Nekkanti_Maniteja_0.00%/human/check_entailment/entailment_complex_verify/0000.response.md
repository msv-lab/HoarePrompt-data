### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Calculation of `c`:**
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs (`n * (n - 1) // 2`), modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The code incorrectly uses `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` instead of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This results in `c` being equal to `1` instead of the correct modular inverse.

3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums up the initial friendship values of all pairs into `a`.

4. **Summation Logic:**
   - The program attempts to compute the expected value `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` in a loop that runs `k` times.
   - This formula is incorrect for the problem's expected value calculation. The expected value for each pair should be calculated based on the probability of selecting that pair and the expected increase in its friendship value over `k` excursions.

**Issues Identified:**
- **Incorrect Calculation of Probability:**
  - The probability of selecting any specific pair is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`. The code incorrectly uses `1` instead of `n * (n - 1) // 2` in the `pow` function, making `c` equal to `1`.

- **Incorrect Summation Logic:**
  - The formula used in the summation loop (`s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`) does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.

- **Handling of Friendship Values:**
  - The code sums up the initial friendship values in `a` but does not correctly incorporate the expected increase in these values over the `k` excursions.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Calculate the Probability:**
   - The probability of selecting any specific pair is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
   - Compute the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Compute Expected Increase:**
   - For each pair of friends, compute the expected increase in its friendship value over `k` excursions.
   - The expected increase for a pair with initial friendship value `f_i` is `f_i * k + (k * (k - 1) // 2) * (1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2))`.

3. **Sum Up Expected Values:**
   - Sum up the expected values for all pairs and compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions due to incorrect calculation of probability and summation logic.

**Final: False**
