### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotated version of the code and the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It reads each throw's distance `r` and direction `c` using `func_1()`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it processes the distance `r` and direction `c`:
     - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new player number by adding `r` to the current player number `q` and taking modulo `n`.
     - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new player number by subtracting `r` from the current player number `q` and taking modulo `n`.
   - These new player numbers are added to a temporary set `temp`.

3. **Handling Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly handles the circular nature of the players.
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if necessary. This is because player numbers are from `1` to `n`, and `0` should be mapped to `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all throws, the program outputs the number of possible players with the ball and their numbers in increasing order.
   - The use of a set ensures that there are no duplicate player numbers.

#### Verification Against the Problem Requirements:

- **Direction Handling:** The program correctly handles all possible directions ('0', '1', '?') for each throw.
- **Set Usage:** The use of a set to track possible players ensures that no duplicates are counted.
- **Modulo Operation:** The modulo operation correctly handles circular movement in the game.
- **Special Case Handling:** The special case where the modulo operation results in `0` is handled correctly by replacing it with `n`.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each throw, and outputs the correct number of possible players with the ball and their numbers in increasing order.

**Final: True**
