You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` such that 0 <= bit < 30. It recursively processes the list to determine a maximum length based on specific bit conditions. If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. Otherwise, it filters `cur_arr` to create `new_arr` based on the `bit`-th bit and recursively calculates the maximum length, considering the length of `new_arr` and the results of further recursive calls.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The program is supposed to find the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to `x`.

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(arr, x)`: This function calls `find_max(cur_arr, bit)` with `bit` set to 31 (the highest bit position for a 32-bit integer).
2. `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`: This function recursively tries to split the array `cur_arr` into segments based on the current bit position `bit`. It checks if the XOR of the segments satisfies the condition with respect to `x`.

Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem statement:

- The function `find_max` uses a divide-and-conquer approach to split the array based on the current bit position.
- It checks if the XOR of the current segment (up to the current bit) is zero or not. If it is zero, it means that the segment can be considered as a valid segment.
- The function recursively checks the next lower bit position to see if further segments can be formed.
- The function returns the maximum number of valid segments that can be formed.

However, there are a few issues with the provided code:

1. **Bitwise Operations**: The function `find_max` uses bitwise operations to determine the segments, but it does not properly handle the condition that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment should be less than or equal to `x`.
2. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is 0 or when the array contains only one element.
3. **Recursive Depth**: The function uses recursion depth of up to 31, which might not be necessary and could be optimized.

Let's consider a specific test case to see if the program works correctly:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The segments [1] and [2, 3] are valid because (1) | (2 ^ 3) = 1, which is less than or equal to 1.

Let's check if the provided code gives the correct output for this test case:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    return find_max(arr, 31)

def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1

# Test case
arr = [1, 2, 3]
x = 1
print(func_1(arr, x))  # Expected output: 2
```

Running the test case, we get the output `2`, which is correct.

However, let's consider another test case to ensure the code handles all edge cases correctly:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 2
1 3 3 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- The segments [1], [3], and [3, 7] are valid because (1) | (3) | (3 ^ 7) = 2, which is less than or equal to 2.

Let's check if the provided code gives the correct output for this test case:

```python
# Test case
arr = [1, 3, 3, 7]
x = 2
print(func_1(arr, x))  # Expected output: 3
```

Running the test case, we get the output `2`, which is incorrect.

Based on this analysis, the provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly and does not always produce the expected output.

Correctness: **False**.
