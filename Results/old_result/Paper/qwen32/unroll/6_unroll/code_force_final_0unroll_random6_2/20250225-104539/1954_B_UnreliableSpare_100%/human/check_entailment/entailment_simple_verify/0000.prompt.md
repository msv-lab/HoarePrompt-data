You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #Output State:

    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum of its original value and cnt)
    #State: `flag` is `False`; `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the count of consecutive `val` elements at the end of the array. The `flag` remains `False` regardless of the initial value.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and find a potential case where it fails.

The program works as follows:
1. It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because the array cannot stop being beautiful.
2. If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements and prints that value as the answer.

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of breaking the "beautiful" property by removing elements in a way that does not necessarily involve removing the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements.

### Potential Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6
1 2 3 2 1 1
```
For this array, the program will find the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements, which is `1` (e.g., the last element). However, removing just one `1` does not make the array stop being beautiful. We need to remove at least two `1`s to break the beautiful property.

The correct output for this test case should be `2` (remove the last two `1`s to get `1 2 3 2` which is not beautiful).

### Why the Program Fails:
The program does not account for the need to break the "beautiful" property by potentially removing more elements than just the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements. It only considers the shortest subarray, which is insufficient to determine the minimum number of removals required in all cases.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
