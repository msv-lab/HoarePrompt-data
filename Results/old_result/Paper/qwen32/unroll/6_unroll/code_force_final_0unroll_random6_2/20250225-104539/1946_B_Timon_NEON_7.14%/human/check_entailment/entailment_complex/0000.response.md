### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic of the functions and the overall flow of the program to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

#### Key Points:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, where each operation involves inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array.
2. **Key Operation**: Since inserting the sum of a subarray into the array can be done multiple times, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the sum of the maximum positive-sum subarray.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The final answer must be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Analysis of the Functions:
- **func_1**: This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given integer.
- **func_2**: This function aims to find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum. It uses a variation of Kadane's algorithm to track the maximum sum subarray. However, there are some issues in its implementation:
  - The `max_segment` and `new_segment` are not correctly updated.
  - The logic for handling negative numbers and transitioning between segments is flawed.
  - The final check `if (len(total_max_segment) == 1): total_max_segment = [-1]` is incorrect. It should not reset `total_max_segment` to `[-1]` if no positive sum subarray is found; instead, it should handle the case where all elements are negative.
- **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code snippet and seems incomplete.

#### Correctness of the Program:
The main issue lies in `func_2`. The logic to find the maximum sum subarray is not correctly implemented, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if all elements in the array are negative, the function should return `0` as the maximum sum, but it might incorrectly return `[-1]`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in `func_2`, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
