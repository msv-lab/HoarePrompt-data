### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to determine if the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid Representation**: The river is represented as a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns. Each cell `(i, j)` contains a depth `a_{i,j}`.
2. **Bridge Construction**: For each row, Rudolf can build a bridge by installing supports at specific cells. The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
3. **Support Placement Rules**:
   - A support must be installed in cell `(i, 1)`.
   - A support must be installed in cell `(i, m)`.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
4. **Objective**: Rudolf needs to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows and minimize the total cost of installing supports.

#### Function Breakdown:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum cost of building a bridge on a single row.
   - **Logic**:
     - The first element of the row is set to 1.
     - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2.
     - For each subsequent element, the function uses a min-heap to find the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d` and updates the current element based on this minimum value.
     - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost for that row.
   - **Output Hint**: The function modifies the row based on specific rules and returns the last element of the modified row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate and print the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - **Logic**:
     - Reads the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - Reads the grid of depths.
     - Computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - Evaluates all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and computes the total cost for each set.
     - Outputs the minimum of these total costs.
   - **Output Hint**: The function calculates the minimum cost for each row, evaluates all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows, and prints the minimum total cost.

#### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for building a bridge on a single row by considering the constraints on support placement.
- The function `func_2` correctly evaluates all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and computes the total cost for each set, ensuring that the minimum total cost is found.

However, there seems to be an issue with the logic in `func_1`. The function does not correctly implement the sliding window logic for finding the minimum cost within the constraints. Specifically, the while loop that pops elements from the heap does not correctly ensure that the minimum value within the window is used. This could lead to incorrect cost calculations.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the program is not entirely correct due to the potential issue in the sliding window logic within `func_1`.

**Correctness: False**
