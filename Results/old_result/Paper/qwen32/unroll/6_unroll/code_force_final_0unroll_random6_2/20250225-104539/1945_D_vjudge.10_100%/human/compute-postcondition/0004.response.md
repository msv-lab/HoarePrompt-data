Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `pergunta` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), `n` (an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill), and `m` (an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill). For each test case, the function evaluates the lists `a` and `b` along with `n` and `m`, and returns a result indicating whether Kirill can achieve a final position within the limit `m` based on the conditions defined by the lists `a` and `b`.**
