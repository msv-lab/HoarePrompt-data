You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        bullets_used = 0
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of monsters `n`, a bullet range multiplier `k`, a list `a` of monster health values, and a list `x` of monster positions. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the given constraints and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the monsters based on their absolute distance from the player's position (point 0). This sorting strategy is intended to ensure that the closest monsters are dealt with first, which is a logical approach to prevent any of the monsters from reaching the player.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to determine if the player can survive and kill all the monsters. The program calculates the total bullets needed to kill each monster and checks if this number is less than or equal to the product of the monster's distance from the player and the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second (k). This check is performed cumulatively, which is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the number of bullets available each second is limited to k.

To illustrate, consider the following example from the problem statement:

```
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

The program would sort the monsters by their absolute distance from the player, resulting in the following order: (-1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3). It then calculates the total bullets needed for each monster and checks if this is less than or equal to the product of the monster's distance and k. However, this check does not account for the fact that the player can only fire up to k bullets per second.

In the first second, the player can fire 2 bullets, which can be used to kill the first monster. In the second second, the player can fire 2 bullets, which can be used to kill the second monster. In the third second, the player can fire 2 bullets, which can be used to kill the third monster. Therefore, the player should be able to survive and kill all the monsters.

However, the program will incorrectly determine that the player cannot survive because it does not account for the fact that the number of bullets available each second is limited to k.

The correct approach would be to simulate the process of firing bullets and moving the monsters, ensuring that the player does not run out of bullets and that no monsters reach the player's position.
