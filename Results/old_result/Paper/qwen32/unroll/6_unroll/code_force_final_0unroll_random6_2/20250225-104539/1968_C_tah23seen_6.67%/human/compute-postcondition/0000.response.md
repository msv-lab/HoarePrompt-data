The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers and `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in `arr`. After executing the code, the list `ans` is created with `n` elements, all set to 0, while `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
