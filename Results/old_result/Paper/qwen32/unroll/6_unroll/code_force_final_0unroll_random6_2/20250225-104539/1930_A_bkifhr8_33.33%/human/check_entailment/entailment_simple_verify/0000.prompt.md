You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum final score. The issue lies in how the program selects pairs of numbers to add the minimum of to the score.

In the program, the pairs are chosen without any specific strategy to maximize the score. It simply takes the first two elements from the list, removes them, and adds the minimum of the two to the score. This does not guarantee that the score will be maximized.

To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to sort the list of numbers and then pair the smallest number with the next smallest number, the third smallest with the fourth smallest, and so on. This ensures that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible, leading to the highest possible score.

Here is an example where the provided program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 3 2 4 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- After sorting the list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- Pair the numbers as follows: (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)
- The score is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`

**Actual Output of the Program:**
- The program will likely take the first two numbers (1, 3) and add 1 to the score.
- Then it might take the next two numbers (2, 4) and add 2 to the score.
- Finally, it will take the last two numbers (5, 6) and add 5 to the score.
- The score will be `1 + 2 + 5 = 8`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum final score in all cases.
