Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer from 0 to `n-1` that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once, with the condition that if multiple such integers exist, the smallest one that appears exactly once is printed only if there is no integer that does not appear at all.**
