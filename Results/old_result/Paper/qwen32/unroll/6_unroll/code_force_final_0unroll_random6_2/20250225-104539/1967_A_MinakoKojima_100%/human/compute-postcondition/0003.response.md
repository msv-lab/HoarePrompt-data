In the given task, the for loop iterates over `ans_list`. Therefore, the state of `ans_list` is the only one that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. 

To ensure the loop executes, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`ans_list` must contain at least one element, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` retain their values from the last test case**
