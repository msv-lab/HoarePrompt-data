Correctness: **False**

The given program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function and the way it is used to determine the output. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if so, it returns `True` and the program prints `0`, which is incorrect. The beauty of the array is maximized by arranging the elements in non-decreasing order, but the program should calculate the beauty of the sorted array regardless of the initial order.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

In this corrected version, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty without checking the initial order. This ensures the maximum beauty is always calculated.
