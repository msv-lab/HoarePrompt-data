The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676. After executing this code, the value of `t` will be the integer provided by the user, which still satisfies the condition 1 <= t <= 676. The values of `n` and `k` for each test case are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26.**
