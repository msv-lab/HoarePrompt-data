To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the provided state.

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(1, num2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `num2`. The loop will execute if `num2` is greater than 1 because `range(1, num2)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `num2`. If `num2` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given state before the for loop:
- `a` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` (i.e., `num2` == `n`).
- `order` is 0.

Since `num2` is defined as the length of the list `a` and `n` is guaranteed to be between 2 and 100, `num2` will always be greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `num2` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `i` is the loop variable and gets initialized automatically by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` (i.e., `num2` == `n`), and `order` is 0**.
