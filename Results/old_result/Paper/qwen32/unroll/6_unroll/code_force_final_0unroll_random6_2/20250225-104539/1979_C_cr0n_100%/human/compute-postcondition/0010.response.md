Postcondition: **`N` is the integer value provided by the user input, `vals` is a list of integers where each integer \( k_i \) represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that \( 2 \leq k_i \leq 20 \), and the length of `vals` is equal to `N`, with `vals` now holding the specific integers read from the input; `den` is the product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`; `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`; `den` is greater than 0.**
