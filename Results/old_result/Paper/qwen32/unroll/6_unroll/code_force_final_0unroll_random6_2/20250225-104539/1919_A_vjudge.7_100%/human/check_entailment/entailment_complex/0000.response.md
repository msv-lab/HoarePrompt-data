### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key observation is that if the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because:

- If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always face a situation where Bob can mirror her moves, ensuring that Alice eventually runs out of moves first.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make the first move and then mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that Bob eventually runs out of moves first.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` using the bitwise AND operation with 1 (`a + b & 1`). If the result is 0, it means the sum is even, and the program prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

### Correctness:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins. It handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement and outputs the correct result for each case.

**Correctness: True**
