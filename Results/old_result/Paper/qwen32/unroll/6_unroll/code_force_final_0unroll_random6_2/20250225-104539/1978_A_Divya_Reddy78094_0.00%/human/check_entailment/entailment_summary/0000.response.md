Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. For each test case, the program reads the number of books `n` and the number of pages in each book. It then sorts the list of page numbers in descending order. Since Alice reads the book with the highest number of pages from each pile, the optimal strategy is to take the two largest books and consider them as the highest from two different piles. The program correctly computes the sum of the two largest numbers in the sorted list, which represents the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

Execution Summary:  
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then sorts the list in reverse order and outputs the sum of the first two elements, which are the largest and second largest numbers in the list.

Given this understanding, the program behaves as expected according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
