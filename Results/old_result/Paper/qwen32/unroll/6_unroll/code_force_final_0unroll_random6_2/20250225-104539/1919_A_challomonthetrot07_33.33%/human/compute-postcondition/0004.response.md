Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively. It then prints "Alice" or "Bob" based on specific conditions related to the values of `a` and `b`. The final state of the program is that it outputs `t` lines, each indicating the winner ("Alice" or "Bob") for the corresponding test case.**
