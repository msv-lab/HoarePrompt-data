Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` which is the number of test cases (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, it accepts `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and `s` (a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input string `s` for each test case.**
