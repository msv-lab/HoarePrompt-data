You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, the number of moves, and the moves themselves. A correct function definition would be `def func_1(test_cases)`, where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, and a list of `k` moves. Each move is a tuple of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. The precondition is that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, for each test case `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= n`, and each move `(r_i, c_i)` satisfies `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: [7, 25]
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns 25
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is an integer. Despite the incorrect function definition provided, the function always returns the value 25 regardless of the input `n`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 25


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
