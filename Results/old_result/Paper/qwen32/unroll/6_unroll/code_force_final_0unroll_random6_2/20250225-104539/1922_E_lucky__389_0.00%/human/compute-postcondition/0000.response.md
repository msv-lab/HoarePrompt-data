The code provided assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `x`. This means that `x` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. The value of `t` and the constraints on `X` for the test cases remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer.**
