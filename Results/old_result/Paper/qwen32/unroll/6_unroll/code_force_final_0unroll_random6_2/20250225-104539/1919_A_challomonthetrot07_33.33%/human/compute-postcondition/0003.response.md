Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function returns the result for each test case, which is "Alice" if `a` is greater than `b`, "Bob" if `b` is greater than `a`, and "Tie" if `a` is equal to `b`.**
