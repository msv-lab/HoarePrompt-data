### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the winner of the game between Sasha and Anna based on the conditions described in the problem. Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements the logic to determine the winner.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `total_digits` is initialized to accumulate the total number of digits in the list of integers.
   - `zeros` is a list that stores the count of trailing zeros for each integer in the list after reversing its digits. This is done using the function `func_1(num)`, which counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string representation of a number.
   - The `zeros` list is then sorted in descending order.
   - The program calculates `subtract_zero` by summing up the counts of trailing zeros at even indices in the sorted `zeros` list. This is because Sasha can strategically concatenate numbers in a way that minimizes the impact of trailing zeros, and Anna's moves (reversing digits) can introduce trailing zeros.
   - The program then checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Function `func_1(num)`:**
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of a number. It iterates from the end of the string towards the beginning, counting zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

### Analysis:

- **Logic of the Game:**
  - The key to determining the winner lies in the number of digits in the final number formed after all moves.
  - Anna's moves (reversing digits) can introduce trailing zeros, which can reduce the number of digits in the final number.
  - Sasha's moves (concatenating numbers) can help in forming a larger number by strategically avoiding the impact of trailing zeros introduced by Anna.

- **Implementation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the total number of digits.
  - It tracks the impact of Anna's moves by counting trailing zeros introduced.
  - The strategy of summing up trailing zeros at even indices in the sorted list is a reasonable approach to simulate Sasha's optimal play.
  - The final comparison checks if the resulting number of digits is sufficient for Sasha to win.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
