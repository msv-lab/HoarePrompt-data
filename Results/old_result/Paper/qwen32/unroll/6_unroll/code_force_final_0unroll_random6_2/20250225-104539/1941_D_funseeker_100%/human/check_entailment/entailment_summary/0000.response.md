### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws, given the initial player, the number of players, and the details of each throw (distance and direction). The solution involves reading multiple test cases, processing each throw for each test case, and then outputting the results.

The provided code is structured into four functions:
1. **func_1**: Reads a line of input and returns it as a string.
2. **func_2**: Converts the string returned by `func_1` to an integer. This is used to read the number of test cases.
3. **func_3**: Reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.
4. **func_4**: This is the main function that processes each test case. It initializes the set of possible players with the starting player `x`. For each throw, it updates the set of possible players based on the throw distance and direction. Finally, it handles the case where the result might include `0` (which should be replaced by `n`), and then prints the number of possible players and their sorted list.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly handle the input reading and parsing as per the problem description.
- **Processing Each Throw**: In `func_4`, the logic for updating the set of possible players is correct. It considers both clockwise and counterclockwise directions when the direction is unknown (`'?'`), and only the specified direction otherwise. The modulo operation ensures that the player numbers wrap around correctly within the range `[1, n]`.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles the edge case where the result might include `0` by replacing it with `n`. This is a valid approach because in a circle, player `0` is equivalent to player `n`.
- **Output**: The function correctly outputs the number of possible players and their sorted list.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles multiple test cases, processes each throw correctly, and outputs the results in the required format.

**Correctness: True**
