You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one a_i equal to 1 in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: For each test case, the number of zeros between the first and last 1 in the list `a` after removing any leading and trailing zeros is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the program step by step and analyze if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:

The goal is to move chips such that they form a single block with no free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required is the number of free cells within the range of the chips' positions.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the list `a` which represents the cells (0 for free, 1 for a chip).

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
   - The program removes leading and trailing free cells from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()` respectively. This step is correct because these free cells do not contribute to the number of moves needed to consolidate the chips into a single block.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program then iterates over the remaining cells in `a` and counts the number of free cells (cells with value `0`).
   - This count is stored in `res` and represents the number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

- **Handling Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
  - By removing leading and trailing free cells, the program effectively focuses only on the range of cells that contain chips or free cells that need to be filled by moving chips.

- **Counting Free Cells:**
  - The number of free cells within the range of the chips is the correct measure of the minimum number of moves required to consolidate the chips into a single block.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to consolidate the chips into a single block. It handles all edge cases, including when all chips are already in a single block or when there are no chips at all (though the problem specifies at least one chip per test case).

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
