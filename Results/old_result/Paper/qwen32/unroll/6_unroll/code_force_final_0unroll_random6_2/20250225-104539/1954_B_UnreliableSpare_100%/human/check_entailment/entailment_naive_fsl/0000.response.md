Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and find a potential case where it fails.

The program works as follows:
1. It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because the array cannot stop being beautiful.
2. If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same elements and prints that value as the answer.

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of breaking the "beautiful" property by removing elements in a way that does not necessarily involve removing the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements.

### Potential Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6
1 2 3 2 1 1
```
For this array, the program will find the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements, which is `1` (e.g., the last element). However, removing just one `1` does not make the array stop being beautiful. We need to remove at least two `1`s to break the beautiful property.

The correct output for this test case should be `2` (remove the last two `1`s to get `1 2 3 2` which is not beautiful).

### Why the Program Fails:
The program does not account for the need to break the "beautiful" property by potentially removing more elements than just the shortest contiguous subarray of the same elements. It only considers the shortest subarray, which is insufficient to determine the minimum number of removals required in all cases.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
