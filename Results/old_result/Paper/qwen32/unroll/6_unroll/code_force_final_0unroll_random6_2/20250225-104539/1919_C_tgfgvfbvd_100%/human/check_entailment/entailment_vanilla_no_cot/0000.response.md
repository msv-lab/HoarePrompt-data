Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program seems to be trying to find a way to minimize the penalty but does not follow the optimal strategy for this problem.

The optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty involves recognizing that the penalty is essentially counting the number of increasing subsequences minus the number of "jumps" or discontinuities in the sequence. The correct approach is to use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that minimizes the number of such jumps.

The current program does not correctly implement this strategy and instead seems to be trying to maintain two variables `a` and `b` to track some form of minimum values, which does not directly relate to the problem's requirements.

Here is a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. For each element in the array, consider it as a potential split point.
2. Calculate the penalty for the left and right subsequences if split at that point.
3. Track the minimum penalty encountered.

However, a more efficient approach involves recognizing that the minimum penalty is equivalent to the number of increasing subsequences minus the number of "jumps" or discontinuities, which can be computed in a single pass through the array. The correct solution would involve counting the number of times the sequence stops increasing, which is equivalent to the number of "jumps" or discontinuities.

Given the complexity and constraints of the problem, a linear scan approach is likely the most efficient solution.
