### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution using the annotated code and the original assessment.

**Problem Analysis:**
We need to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
1. Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

**Template Matching Conditions:**
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be the same as the i-th letter of the template `t`.
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template `t`.

**Solution Analysis:**
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function checks if there exists at least one position `i` where the i-th characters of `a` and `b` are different from the i-th character of `c`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases, reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

**Correctness of the Solution:**
Let's consider the logic of `func_1`:
- The function iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.

**Key Insight:**
- If `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, it means that we can choose the i-th character of the template `t` to be the uppercase version of `c[i]` (i.e., `C[i] = c[i].upper()`). This ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` (both different from `c[i]`) will match the template `t` because they are different from the lowercase version of `C[i]`, while `c[i]` will not match the template `t` because `c[i]` is the same as the lowercase version of `C[i]`.

**Original Assessment:**
The original assessment states that the logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not. The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

**Validation Using Annotations:**
- The annotations confirm that `func_1` iterates through each character position and checks the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]`.
- If such a position is found, the function returns 'YES', which is correct based on the problem's requirements.
- If no such position is found, the function returns 'NO', which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements. The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **True**
