To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given code snippet. 

The code consists of a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x`, computes `y` as `x - 1`, and prints `y`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Input**: The first line of input is an integer `t`, which indicates the number of test cases. Following this, there are `t` lines, each containing a single integer `x`.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each of the `t` test cases:
   - The integer `x` is read.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.
   - The value of `y` is printed.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final state of the variables `x` and `y` after the loop completes is not retained. The only output of the loop is the series of printed values of `y` for each test case.

Therefore, the output state can be described as the series of printed values of `y` for each test case. However, since we need to adhere to the given format and describe the output state in terms of the variables involved, we can say that after the loop finishes, the variables `x` and `y` do not retain any specific values as they are reassigned in each iteration. The only persistent output is the printed values.

Given the format requirement, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **The output consists of `t` lines, each containing an integer which is one less than the corresponding input integer `x`.**

However, if we need to strictly follow the format provided in the question and describe the state of variables `x` and `y` after the loop, we can say:

Output State: **Variables `x` and `y` do not retain specific values after the loop, but the output consists of `t` lines, each being `x - 1` from the corresponding input.**

To match the required format exactly:

Output State: **The output consists of `t` lines, each being the value of `x - 1` from the corresponding input.**
