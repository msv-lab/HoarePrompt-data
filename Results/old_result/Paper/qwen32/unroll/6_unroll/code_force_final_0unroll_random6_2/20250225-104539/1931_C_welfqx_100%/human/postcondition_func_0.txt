The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints an integer value based on the list `a`. The printed value is the result of subtracting the maximum length of consecutive identical elements from the start or end of the list from `n`.
