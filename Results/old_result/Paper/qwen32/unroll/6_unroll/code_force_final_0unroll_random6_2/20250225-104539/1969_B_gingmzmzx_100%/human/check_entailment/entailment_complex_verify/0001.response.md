### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The logic in the program is flawed because it counts the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and vice versa rather than calculating the actual cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

To sort the binary string with the minimum cost, a more appropriate approach would be to consider the cost of moving all `1`s to the right of all `0`s. The provided program, however, does not account for the cost of these shifts but instead performs a different calculation that does not yield the correct result.

Let's re-evaluate the logic with an example:

For the string `11000`:
- The correct approach would involve moving the `1`s to the right of the `0`s. The optimal operations would be:
  1. Shift the substring `[1, 3]` to get `01100` (cost = 3).
  2. Shift the substring `[2, 4]` to get `00110` (cost = 3).
  3. Shift the substring `[3, 5]` to get `00011` (cost = 3).
- Total cost = 9.

However, the provided program calculates the cost as follows:
- `cnt[0] = 0`, `cnt[1] = 0`, `ans = 0`
- `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 1`, `ans = 0`
- `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 2`, `ans = 0`
- `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 1`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
- `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 2`, `ans = 2`
- `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 3`, `ans = 2`
- Final `ans = 2`, which is incorrect.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct in stating that the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
