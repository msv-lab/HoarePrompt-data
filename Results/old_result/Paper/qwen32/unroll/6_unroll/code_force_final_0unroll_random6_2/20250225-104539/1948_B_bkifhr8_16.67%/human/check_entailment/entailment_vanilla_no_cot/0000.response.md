Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, it only attempts to split the number at the first occurrence where the order is violated and does not continue to check if further splits are needed to achieve a sorted array. Additionally, the logic for splitting the numbers needs to be more robust to handle cases where multiple splits are necessary.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. **Single Pass Issue:** The current implementation only makes one pass through the list and attempts to fix the first occurrence of an unordered pair. This is insufficient because additional splits might be required after the first split to maintain or achieve a sorted order.

2. **Splitting Logic:** The current logic splits a number into two digits only if the previous number is greater than the current one and is at least 10. However, this does not guarantee that the resulting array will be sorted. The split might introduce new unordered pairs that need to be addressed.

3. **Recursive or Repeated Splitting:** The problem requires a more comprehensive approach, such as repeatedly checking the array and splitting numbers until no more splits are needed or it is determined that the array cannot be sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    while True:
        modified = False
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 1:
            if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
                if a[i] >= 10:
                    # Split the number
                    digits = [int(d) for d in str(a[i])]
                    a = a[:i] + digits + a[i+1:]
                    modified = True
                    break
                else:
                    return False
            i += 1
        if not modified:
            break
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This version repeatedly checks the array and splits numbers as needed until no more splits are possible, ensuring that the array is fully processed before checking if it is sorted.
