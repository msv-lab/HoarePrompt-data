#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers, r and l are integers that will be used to store the indices of the subarray to be modified, and over_sum is an integer representing the sum of the elements in lst before any modifications.
def func_1(lst):

    #State: - `lst` remains unchanged.
    #- `r` and `l` will be the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximizes `sm`.
    #- `over_sum` will be the maximum value of `sm` found.
    #
    #Since the specific values of `lst` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `r`, `l`, and the final `over_sum`. However, we can describe the state in a general form.
    #
    #Output State:
    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum `sm` of a subarray in `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and returns the indices `r` and `l` that define the subarray within the list whose modified sum is maximized. The modification involves replacing the subarray with a sum of its elements outside the subarray plus the square of the subarray's length.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `r` and `l`, which are integers satisfying the condition 0 <= l <= r, and `ops`, which is a list. The function modifies the list `ops` by appending lists of two integers to it. The function does not return any value.

    #The program returns a list `lst` where the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are all equal to `n`, and `n` is `l - r + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies a list `lst` by setting all elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the specified range (`l - r + 1`). It also appends operations to the list `ops`. The function returns the modified list `lst`.
