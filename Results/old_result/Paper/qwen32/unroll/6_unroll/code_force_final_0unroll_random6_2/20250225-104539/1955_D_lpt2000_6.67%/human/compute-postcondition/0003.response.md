Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= k <= m <= n`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^6. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
