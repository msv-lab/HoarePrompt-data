To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to ensure that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's go through the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players (`n`), the number of throws (`m`), and the starting player (`x`) using `func_3()`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance (`r`) and the direction (`c`) using `func_1()`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set of possible players who could have the ball (`ans`) based on the direction of the throw:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the player who would be reached by moving `r` positions clockwise.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the player who would be reached by moving `r` positions counterclockwise.
   - It ensures that the modulo operation correctly wraps around the circle.

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the number of possible players who could have the ball after all throws.
   - It prints the sorted list of these players.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the modulo operation results in `0` by converting it to `n` (since player numbers start from `1`).

The program appears to correctly implement the required logic. It efficiently handles the unknown directions by considering both possibilities and uses a set to keep track of all possible players who could have the ball. It also correctly handles the circular nature of the players using modulo arithmetic.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
