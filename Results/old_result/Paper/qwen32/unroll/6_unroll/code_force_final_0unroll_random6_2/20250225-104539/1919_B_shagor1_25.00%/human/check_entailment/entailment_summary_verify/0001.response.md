### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not always compute the minimum penalty for all test cases and that the formula `n - 2 * neg` is not sufficient to achieve the optimal splitting strategy. Let's break down the reasoning in detail:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The goal is to split the string `s` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is `|sum(subarray)| * len(subarray)`.
   - To minimize the penalty, we need to find subarrays where the sum is `0` whenever possible.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The optimal strategy involves balancing the counts of `+` and `-` in subarrays.
   - Simply counting the number of `-` characters and using the formula `n - 2 * neg` does not guarantee the minimum penalty for all cases.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the `func_1` function.
   - `func_1` counts the number of `-` characters (`neg`) and calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - The first two test cases are correctly handled.
   - The third test case is also correctly handled, as the string can be split into subarrays with a sum of `0`.
   - The fourth and fifth test cases demonstrate that the formula does not yield the correct minimum penalty.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is insufficient because it does not consider the optimal way to split the string into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The optimal solution requires a more complex approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the best possible subarray splits.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. The formula used does not always yield the minimum penalty, and a more sophisticated approach is needed.

**Final: False**
