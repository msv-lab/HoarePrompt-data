The code snippet initializes a list `sum_values` with zeros, where the length of the list is `max(numbers) + 1`. This means that `sum_values` will have a length equal to the largest number in the `numbers` list plus one, and all elements in this list will be initialized to 0.

The variables `t` and `numbers` remain unchanged. The `values` list is also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the input representing the number of test cases; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each read from the input during the loop iterations; `values` is a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`; `sum_values` is a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`.**
