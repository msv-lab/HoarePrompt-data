### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by replacing subarrays with their MEX values.
- The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
- The operations are constrained to be no more than \(5 \times 10^5\).

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To find the subarray `[r, l]` that, when replaced by its MEX value, maximizes the sum.
   - **Implementation**: The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a new sum `sm` based on the length of the subarray squared. It then updates `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.
   - **Issue**: The function does not compute the MEX value of the subarray. Instead, it uses the length of the subarray squared, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to compute the MEX value and calculate the potential new sum based on this MEX value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To generate the operations for replacing subarrays.
   - **Implementation**: The function recursively generates operations in a manner that does not align with the problem requirements. It does not generate operations based on the MEX value.
   - **Issue**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not generate the operations in a way that maximizes the sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Purpose**: To perform the operations and update the list.
   - **Implementation**: The function attempts to perform the operations and update the list, but it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray. It also does not generate the operations in a way that maximizes the sum.
   - **Issue**: Similar to `func_1` and `func_2`, the function does not compute the MEX value and does not generate the operations correctly.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not address the core issue of computing the MEX value correctly.
- The annotations do not provide any evidence that the program is correctly implementing the logic to maximize the sum of the array.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Compute the MEX**: For each subarray, compute the MEX value correctly.
- **Update the Sum**: Replace the subarray with the MEX value and update the sum if it increases.
- **Generate Operations**: Generate the operations to achieve the replacement in a way that maximizes the sum.

#### Example Case:
For the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
Explanation:
- Replace the subarray `[3, 3]` with `0` (MEX value of `[2]` is `0`), resulting in `[1, 100, 0, 1]`.
- Replace the subarray `[3, 4]` with `2` (MEX value of `[0, 1]` is `2`), resulting in `[1, 100, 2, 2]`.
- The sum is `1 + 100 + 2 + 2 = 105`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. The issues in the code are significant and cannot be resolved by the current implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
