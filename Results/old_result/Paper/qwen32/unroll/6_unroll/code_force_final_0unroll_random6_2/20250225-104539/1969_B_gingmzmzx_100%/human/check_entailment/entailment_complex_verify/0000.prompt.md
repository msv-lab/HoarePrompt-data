You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a binary string s (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}) which needs to be sorted in non-descending order.

    #State: a series of integers, each representing the number of inversions for each binary string in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It calculates and prints the number of inversions in each binary string, where an inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and s[i] > s[j].


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed cyclic shifts. The logic in the code does not account for the actual cost of the cyclic shifts but rather seems to be counting certain transitions that do not directly translate to the minimum cost required.

Let's take a closer look at the logic and a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

### Provided Program Logic:
- The program counts the number of `0`s and `1`s in the string.
- It then iterates through the string and keeps track of the count of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far.
- For each character, it seems to calculate some sort of "cost" based on the counts of `0`s and `1`s, but this does not align with the required cost calculation for cyclic shifts.

### Problem Description:
- The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` is `r - l + 1`.
- The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue:
Consider the input string `101011`:

- The correct minimum cost to sort this string is `5` (as per the example provided in the problem description).
- However, the provided program calculates a different value for this input.

Let's run the program with the example input:

```
5
10
0000
11000
101011
01101001
```

The output of the program will be:
```
2
0
9
5
11
```

The output for the string `101011` is `5`, which seems correct in this case, but this is not a general proof of correctness. Let's consider another test case:

### Another Test Case:
Consider the string `110011`:

- The minimum cost to sort this string is `6` (one possible way is to shift the substring `1100` to `0011` with cost `4` and then shift the substring `00111` to `000111` with cost `2`).
- The provided program will output a different value for this input.

Let's run the program with this test case:

```
1
110011
```

The output of the program will be:
```
6
```

In this case, the output seems correct, but it is not a general proof. The logic in the provided program does not seem to be correctly calculating the minimum cost for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all possible binary strings. The logic used in the program does not align with the problem's requirement of calculating the cost of cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
