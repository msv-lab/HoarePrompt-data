Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it performs an unspecified computation and returns a result based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. The constraints are that `k` is between 2 and 30, `x` is between 1 and 100, and `a` is between 1 and 10^9. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000.**
