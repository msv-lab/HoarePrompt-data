### Reasoning:
The program aims to solve the problem by finding a distribution of bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received if any single outcome wins. Here's how the program's approach breaks down:

1. **LCM Calculation**: The program calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all `k_i`, which ensures that the bets can be evenly distributed in a way that respects the multipliers.

2. **Betting Strategy**: The program then determines the bets by dividing the LCM by each multiplier `k_i`. This ensures that if the `i-th` outcome wins, the returned amount will be exactly the LCM, which is greater than the sum of all bets since the sum of the bets is `sum(LCM / k_i)`, and `sum(LCM / k_i) < LCM` if all `k_i > 1`.

3. **Validation**: The program checks if the sum of the bets (sum of `LCM / k_i`) is less than the LCM. If it is not, it outputs `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists under the given constraints. Otherwise, it outputs the calculated bets.

4. **Output**: The bets are printed in a single line, separated by spaces.

### Analysis:
The logic of the program is sound based on the problem's requirements. The key insight is that by using the LCM, the program ensures that the total amount received from any winning outcome will be strictly greater than the total amount bet, as long as the sum of the individual bets (LCM divided by each `k_i`) is less than the LCM itself. This is always true if all `k_i` are greater than 1, which is guaranteed by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution strategy and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
