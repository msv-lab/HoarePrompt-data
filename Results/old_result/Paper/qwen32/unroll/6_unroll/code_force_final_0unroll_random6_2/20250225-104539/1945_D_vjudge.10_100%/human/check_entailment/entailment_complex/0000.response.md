### Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be incomplete and incorrectly structured, primarily because it relies on a function `func_1` that is supposed to compute the solution for each test case, but it is not correctly defined to do so based on the problem description. Let's break down the issues and the intended logic:

1. **Function Signature and Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `pergunta, a, b, n, m`. However, `pergunta` is initialized as `float('inf')`, which is correct for finding the minimum, but it is not passed correctly as a parameter. Instead, it should be initialized within the function or passed as a different variable. The function should be designed to return a value, not modify an external variable.

2. **Logic Inside `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `x` to 0 and iterates over the lists `a` and `b` in reverse order.
   - It updates `pergunta` (which should be renamed for clarity, perhaps to `min_cost`) with the minimum value between the current `pergunta` and `x + a[i]` when `i < m`.
   - It increments `x` by the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i`.
   - Finally, it prints `pergunta`, which should be the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

3. **Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is not defined to return a value, but instead prints the result directly. This is not ideal for a function that should be reusable and tested in different contexts.
   - The variable `pergunta` is incorrectly named and used as both the minimum cost accumulator and an input parameter.
   - The function does not handle the case when `m` is 0 or 1 correctly, as it should return 0 if Kirill is already among the first `m` people without any swaps.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` should be redesigned to return the minimum cost, and the logic should be correctly implemented to handle all edge cases.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to improper function design and logic implementation.
