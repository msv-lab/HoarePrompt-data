### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements:

**Problem Understanding:**
- Kirill wants to be among the first `m` people in a queue of `n` people.
- He can bribe people to switch positions.
- Switching positions with person `j` costs `a[j]` coins, plus `b[k]` coins for each `k` between `j` and `i` (the current position of Kirill).
- The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to achieve his goal.

**Program Analysis:**
The provided program reads the input for multiple test cases and processes each one using the function `func_1`. The function iterates over the lists `a` and `b` in reverse order, maintaining a cumulative sum `x` of the minimums of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`. It then tries to find the minimum value of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`.

However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the requirement to pay `b[k]` coins for each person `k` between `j` and `i` when switching positions with person `j`. The program only considers the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each position `i` and does not account for the additional `b[k]` costs when `j < k < i`.

**Correct Implementation:**
A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly using a priority queue or dynamic programming, to account for the additional `b[k]` costs. The current implementation is too simplistic and does not handle the problem constraints fully.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program is not correct because it does not accurately account for the additional `b[k]` costs when switching positions with a person `j`.

**Correctness: False**
