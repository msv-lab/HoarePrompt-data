Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization and Loop Logic**: The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. The loop increments `count` up to `m` and calculates `g` as `n / count`. However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

2. **Condition for Valid Pairs**: The problem requires that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The program does not properly implement this condition. It incorrectly calculates `g` and uses it in a way that does not match the problem's constraints.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The program attempts to count valid pairs by incrementing `ans` based on a calculation involving `g` and `count`. This calculation does not correctly determine the number of pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. Here is an outline of a correct approach:

- For each test case, iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
- For each \(a\), iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- Calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of pairs that satisfy this condition and print the result.

Given the constraints, an efficient implementation might involve using mathematical observations or optimizations to avoid checking all pairs explicitly, but the provided program does not follow this approach.
