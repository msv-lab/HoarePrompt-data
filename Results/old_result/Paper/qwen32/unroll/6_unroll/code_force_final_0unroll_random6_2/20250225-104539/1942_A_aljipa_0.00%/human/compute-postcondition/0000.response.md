Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be an input integer, while the conditions and constraints for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are described for each test case that will follow.
