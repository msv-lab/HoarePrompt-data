Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
- `n` is 0.
- `ans` is 9.

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print(ans)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the value of `ans` as it is the only variable referenced in the `print` statement.

From the initial state, we know that `ans` is explicitly set to 9.

Thus, when the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will output the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:
Output: **9**
