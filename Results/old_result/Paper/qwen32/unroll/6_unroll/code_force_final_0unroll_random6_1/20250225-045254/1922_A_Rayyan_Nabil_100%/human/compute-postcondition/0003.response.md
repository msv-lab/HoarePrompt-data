To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the given loop and its effect on the variables.

The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it:
1. Updates the value of `n` by reading a new integer input.
2. Updates the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` by reading new string inputs.
3. Calls a function `func_1` with the updated values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and appends the result to the `results` list.

After the loop finishes, the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values they had in the last iteration of the loop. The `results` list will contain all the results returned by `func_1` during each iteration.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:
- `n` will be the integer value read in the last iteration.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the strings read in the last iteration.
- `t` will remain unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `results` will be a list containing the results of `func_1` from each iteration.

Let's assume the last iteration read `n = 5`, `a = "abcde"`, `b = "fghij"`, `c = "klmno"`, and `func_1` returned some value `res_last` in the last iteration.

The output state will be:
Output State: **n is 5, a is "abcde", b is "fghij", c is "klmno", t is the same as the initial value, results is a list of results from each func_1 call.**

However, without knowing the exact values read in the last iteration and the results of `func_1`, we can only describe the state in terms of the last iteration's inputs and the final state of `results`.

Output State: **n is the integer value read in the last iteration, a is the string read in the last iteration, b is the string read in the last iteration, c is the string read in the last iteration, t is the same as the initial value, results is a list of results from each func_1 call.**
