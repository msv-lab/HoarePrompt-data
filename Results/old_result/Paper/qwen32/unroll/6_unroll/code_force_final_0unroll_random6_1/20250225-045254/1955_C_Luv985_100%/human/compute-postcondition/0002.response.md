The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute. Since `T` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `T` is not zero for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state, `T` is an input integer. To guarantee that the loop executes at least once, `T` must be a non-zero integer. Since the problem statement does not specify any other constraints on `T` other than it being an integer, we simply need to ensure `T` is not zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` must be a non-zero integer**
