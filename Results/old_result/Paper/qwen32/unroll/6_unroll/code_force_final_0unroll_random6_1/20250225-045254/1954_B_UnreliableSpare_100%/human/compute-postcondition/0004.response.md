To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and how it affects the `flag` variable based on the values in the `arr` list. The loop iterates from index 1 to `n-1` (since the range is `range(1, n)`) and checks if the current element `arr[i]` is different from the previous element `arr[i-1]`. If a difference is found, `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.

If the loop completes without finding any differences (i.e., all elements in `arr` are the same), `flag` remains `True`.

Given the initial state, `flag` starts as `True`.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios for the output state:

1. If all elements in `arr` are the same, the loop will not break, and `flag` will remain `True`.
2. If there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are different, the loop will break, and `flag` will be set to `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False.**
