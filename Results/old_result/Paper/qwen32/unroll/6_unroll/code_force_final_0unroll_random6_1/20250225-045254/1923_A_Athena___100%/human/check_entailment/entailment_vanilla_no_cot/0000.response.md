Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The current implementation simply counts the number of free cells within the trimmed sequence of chips, but it does not account for the actual distance each chip needs to be moved.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the position of each chip and calculate the total number of moves required to bring all chips together into a contiguous block. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == 1]
        median_position = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
        res = sum(abs(pos - median_position) for pos in chip_positions)
        print(res)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
1. We first identify the positions of all chips.
2. We determine the median position of these chips. Moving all chips to the median minimizes the total number of moves.
3. We calculate the sum of the distances from each chip's current position to the median position. This sum represents the minimum number of moves required.
