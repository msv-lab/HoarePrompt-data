In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the number of test cases, which is read from the input. The loop head only contains the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and the result of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Here, the state is described by the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop will execute if and only if `t` is greater than 0.

The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned in the context of each test case, but they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we do not need to adjust their states for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4**
