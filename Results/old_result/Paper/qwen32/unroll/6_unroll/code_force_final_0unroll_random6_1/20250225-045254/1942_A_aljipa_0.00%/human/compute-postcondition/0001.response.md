In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is determined by the variable `t`. The loop will execute `t` times. To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10³.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10³.

The variables `n` and `k` do not affect the execution of the loop itself since they are not part of the loop's range condition. The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Since `t` is already defined to be in the range 1 to 1000, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10³, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10³**
