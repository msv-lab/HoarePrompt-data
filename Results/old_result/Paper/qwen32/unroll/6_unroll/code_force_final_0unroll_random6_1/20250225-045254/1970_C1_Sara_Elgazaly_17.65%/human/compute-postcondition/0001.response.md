The code snippet provided initializes a `defaultdict` named `lst` with a default factory of `list`. This means that any key that does not exist in `lst` will automatically be initialized with an empty list when accessed. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer and t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, and there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node of the stone; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `list`.**
