Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The provided code does not implement this logic correctly. Instead, it seems to focus on finding a subarray that maximizes a certain sum calculation and then performs a series of operations that do not necessarily achieve the goal of maximizing the sum based on the MEX rule.

Here are some issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding MEX**: The program does not calculate the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it calculates a different sum and tries to maximize it, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

2. **Incorrect Operations**: The operations performed by `func_2` and `func_3` do not align with the problem's requirements. They do not set subarrays to their MEX values.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The output does not guarantee the maximum possible sum of the array based on the allowed operations.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
- Calculate the MEX of each possible subarray.
- Perform operations to set subarrays to their MEX values.
- Ensure that the number of operations does not exceed the allowed limit (5 * 10^5).

A correct solution would involve more sophisticated algorithms, such as dynamic programming or greedy approaches, to efficiently find and perform the optimal operations.
