Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. Let's break down the issues step by step:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This seems to be an attempt to find the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. However, the calculation is incorrect because it should be `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` instead of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. The `// 1` is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `s`**:
   - The variable `s` is supposed to accumulate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The current implementation of the loop `for i in range(k):` is incorrect. It is supposed to consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the increase in their friendship value over `k` excursions, but the current formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly reflect this logic.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of choosing each pair of friends and the fact that their friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen. The correct approach involves calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair over `k` excursions and summing these contributions.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Modular Arithmetic**:
   - While the program does use modular arithmetic (`% M` at the end), the intermediate calculations are incorrect, so the final result is not correct even if the modular arithmetic were applied correctly.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Summing Contributions**:
   - The program does not correctly sum the contributions of each friend pair. It should calculate the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen and then sum the expected friendship values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
