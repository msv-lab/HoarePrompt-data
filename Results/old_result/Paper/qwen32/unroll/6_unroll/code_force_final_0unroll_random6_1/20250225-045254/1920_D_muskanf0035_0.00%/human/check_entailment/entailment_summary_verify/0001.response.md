### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1**: Append an integer `x` to the array.
   - **Type 2**: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.

2. **Queries**:
   - For each query `k`, return the `k`-th element of the final array.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operation Type 2**:
   - The current implementation of operation type 2 in `func_1` is incorrect. Instead of appending `x` copies of the current array, it appends the current array to itself exactly once.
   - **Correct Behavior**: The correct implementation should extend the array by repeating it `x` times. This means if the current array is `a` and `x` is the number of copies, the new array should be `[a, a, ..., a]` repeated `x` times.

2. **Complexity Concerns**:
   - The provided implementation does not consider the constraints efficiently. Specifically, appending `x` copies of the array (where `x` can be up to \(10^9\)) would result in a very large array, which is impractical to handle within the given constraints.
   - **Correct Approach**: Instead of constructing the full array, we need to track the lengths of the array after each operation and use this information to answer the queries efficiently.

3. **Modulo Operation for Queries**:
   - The modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` is used to handle queries, which is correct if the array is not excessively large. However, given the large potential size of the array due to operation type 2, we need to ensure that we do not actually construct the full array.
   - **Correct Approach**: Use a method that avoids constructing the full array, such as tracking the lengths and using binary search to determine the correct element for each query.

#### Correctness of the Given Program:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly implement the required operations and is therefore incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle operation type 2 and does not efficiently manage the large potential size of the array, making it incorrect for the given problem constraints.
