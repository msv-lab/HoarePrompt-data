Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key idea is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.

Here are some issues with the provided solution:

1. **Maximal Subarray Sum**: The solution attempts to find the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) using a modified version of Kadane's algorithm. However, this is not sufficient for the problem at hand. The goal is to maximize the sum after `k` operations, which involves strategically choosing subarrays to insert their sums.

2. **Operation Utilization**: The solution does not effectively utilize the `k` operations. It incorrectly multiplies the `maxi` by `2 ** k`, which does not represent the correct strategy for inserting subarray sums.

3. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The solution does not fully account for the impact of negative numbers in the array. The strategy should consider how to best incorporate negative numbers into the subarray sums to maximize the overall array sum.

4. **Modulo Operation**: While the solution correctly applies the modulo operation at the end, the logic leading up to this point is flawed, making the final result incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, a more strategic approach is needed, such as:

- Calculating the total sum of the array.
- Identifying the maximum subarray sum.
- Deciding how to best use the `k` operations to maximize the sum, possibly by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum to the total sum.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(a)
        
        # Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        max_subarray_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for num in a:
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, current_sum)
        
        # If total_sum is positive, we can use the operations to maximize the sum
        if total_sum > 0:
            result = (total_sum + max_subarray_sum * k) % MOD
        else:
            result = total_sum % MOD
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations by leveraging the maximum subarray sum and the total sum of the array, while also correctly applying the modulo operation.
