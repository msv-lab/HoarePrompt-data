You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is 2, it outputs the minimum of the two integers. Otherwise, it finds and outputs the maximum median value of all contiguous subarrays of length 3 in the array `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum possible value of the number after performing the described operations. The program only considers subarrays of length 3 to find the median and then updates the maximum median value found. However, the problem requires finding the maximum median value that can be achieved by performing the operations on any subarray, not just subarrays of length 3.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will consider subarrays of length 3:
- [1, 2, 3] -> Median = 2
- [2, 3, 4] -> Median = 3
- [3, 4, 5] -> Median = 4

The program will output `4`, but the correct output should be `4` as well. However, the program does not consider the subarray [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] where the median is `3`, but it can perform operations to reach `4` by first making the subarray [1, 2, 3, 4, 4] and then [1, 2, 4, 4, 4] and finally [4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

Another example where the program fails:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```
The program will consider subarrays of length 3:
- [1, 3, 2] -> Median = 2
- [3, 2, 4] -> Median = 3

The program will output `3`, but the correct output should be `3`. However, the program does not consider the subarray [1, 3, 2, 4] where the median is `2`, but it can perform operations to reach `3` by first making the subarray [1, 3, 3, 4] and then [3, 3, 3, 4] and finally [3, 3, 3, 3].

The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible subarrays to find the maximum median value that can be achieved. It only considers subarrays of length 3, which is not sufficient to guarantee the correct result for all cases.
