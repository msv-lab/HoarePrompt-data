The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` was originally a list of `n` integers. After executing this code, `a` is updated to the new list of integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the input, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**
