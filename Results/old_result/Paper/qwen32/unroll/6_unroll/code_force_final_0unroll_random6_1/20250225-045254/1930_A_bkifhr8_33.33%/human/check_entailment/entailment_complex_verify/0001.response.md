### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the given program using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0 for each test case.
   - It reads the integers into a list `lst` by splitting the input string.

3. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program aims to calculate the maximum score by always choosing pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - The loop iterates `n * 2` times, which is incorrect. Since pairs are being removed, the loop should iterate `n` times.
     - The removal of elements from the list is incorrect. The program attempts to remove elements at indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`, which are always `0` and `2` respectively. This leads to incorrect behavior.
     - The condition `if len(lst) != 2` is unnecessary and incorrectly implemented. The loop should simply iterate `n` times, removing pairs each time.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the scores for each test case.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **Issue in Loop**:
  ```python
  for i in range(n * 2):
      if len(lst) != 2:
          ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
          lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
          lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
      else:
          ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
          break
  ```
  - The loop iterates `n * 2` times, which is incorrect. It should iterate `n` times.
  - The removal of elements using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` is incorrect. The indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always `0` and `2` respectively, leading to incorrect element removal.

### Correct Implementation:

To achieve the correct result, the program should:
- Sort the list of integers.
- Pair the smallest integers together to maximize the sum of the minimums.
- Iterate `n` times, adding the minimum of each pair to the score.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for j in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[j]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis and the annotated code, the original program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum score. The removal of elements from the list is incorrect, and the loop logic is flawed.

**Final: False**
