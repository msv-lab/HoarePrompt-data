The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `x`. If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1. If `x` is found in the list `a`, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the list `a` plus 1. Otherwise, it returns the result of `bl(a, x)`, which is an index where the element is not equal to `x`.
