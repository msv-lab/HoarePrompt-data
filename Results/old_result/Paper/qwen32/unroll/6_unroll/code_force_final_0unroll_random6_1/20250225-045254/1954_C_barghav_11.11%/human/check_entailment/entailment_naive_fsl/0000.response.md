Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) by swapping their digits optimally. The current logic in the function `func_1` simply swaps the digits of the first half of the numbers with the corresponding digits of the second half, and leaves the second half unchanged. This is not a strategy that guarantees the maximum product.

To maximize the product, we should aim to maximize the most significant digits first, as they have a larger impact on the product. A better strategy would be to use a greedy algorithm that iterates through the digits of both numbers and swaps them if it results in a higher product.

Here is an example where the current code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
19
91
```

**Expected Output:**
```
91
19
```

**Actual Output:**
```
19
91
```

In this example, the code does not perform any swaps because it only considers swapping the first half of the digits, and since the numbers are of length 2, it considers the whole number as the first half. However, swapping the digits of both numbers would result in a higher product (91 * 19 > 19 * 91).

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the problem description correctly for all potential cases.
