n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), operations is a list of n tuples where each tuple (b, x) represents an operation (b is either 1 or 2, and x is a positive integer with constraints 1 ≤ x ≤ n if b=1, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 if b=2), and queries is a list of q integers (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) where each integer k_i satisfies 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) with c being the size of the array after all n operations. The sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 10^5.
