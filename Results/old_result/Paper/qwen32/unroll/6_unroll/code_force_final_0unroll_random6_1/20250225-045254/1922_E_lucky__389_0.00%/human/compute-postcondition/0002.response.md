The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `subseq_lens`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `X`, or `x`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the integer value provided by the user input minus 1; `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**
