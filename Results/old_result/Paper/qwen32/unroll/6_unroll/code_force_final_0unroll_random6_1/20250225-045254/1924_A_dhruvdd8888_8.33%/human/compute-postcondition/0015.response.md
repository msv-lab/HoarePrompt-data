Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` disjoint sets of `k` unique characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If such sets are found, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and then prints additional strings based on the characters not found in the sets.**
