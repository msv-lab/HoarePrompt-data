Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of elements that can be removed from the list while ensuring that the first and last elements of the remaining list are not the same, unless the entire list consists of the same element.**
