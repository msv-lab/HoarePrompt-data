Functionality: **The function reads a grid configuration defined by the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`). It calculates a cost for each row using `func_1` and then determines the minimum total cost of selecting `k` consecutive rows' costs. The final output is this minimum total cost.**
