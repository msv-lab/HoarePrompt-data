### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires us to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of the array and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Maximal Subarray Sum:** The key to maximizing the sum of the array after `k` operations is to identify the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the original array. This is because inserting the sum of the maximal subarray will always increase the total sum of the array the most.
2. **Doubling the Maximal Sum:** Each operation can potentially double the contribution of the maximal subarray sum to the total sum. This is because you can insert the sum of the maximal subarray at the end of the array, and then insert the sum of the new array (which now includes the previously inserted sum) again, and so on.
3. **Formula Derivation:** After `k` operations, the contribution of the maximal subarray sum to the total sum can be expressed as `maxi * (2^k - 1)`, where `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. This accounts for the fact that the maximal sum is inserted and re-inserted `k` times, effectively doubling its contribution each time.
4. **Final Sum Calculation:** The final sum of the array after `k` operations is the sum of the original array plus the contribution of the maximal subarray sum after `k` operations. This is expressed as `sum(l) + maxi * (2^k - 1)`.
5. **Modulo Operation:** Since the result can be very large, we take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using a variation of Kadane's algorithm.
- The formula `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` simplifies to `sum(l) + maxi * (2**k - 1)`, which is the correct formula for the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
- The result is correctly taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the above reasoning.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
