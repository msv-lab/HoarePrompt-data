### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided code, the annotations, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Operation Type 1**: Append an integer `x` to the end of array `a`.
- **Operation Type 2**: Append `x` copies of the entire array `a` to the end of array `a`.

The key point here is that when performing Operation Type 2, the entire array `a` should be appended `x` times.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code has a critical issue in handling Operation Type 2. Specifically, the line:
```python
array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```
only doubles the array, regardless of the value of `x`. This is incorrect because it should append the array `x` times, not just double it.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the state of the program but do not address the core issue with the logic for Operation Type 2. The annotations state:
- After the loop finishes, `result` will contain elements from `array` at positions determined by the indices calculated from `queries`.
- The state of `n`, `operations`, `queries`, and `array` remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop after the operations are performed.

These annotations are accurate in terms of the program's state but do not highlight the logical error in handling Operation Type 2.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the code. It points out that the code only doubles the array instead of appending it `x` times. The provided test cases illustrate this issue clearly.

The proposed fix in the original assessment is correct:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))  # Repeat the array x-1 times
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```
This change ensures that the array is appended `x` times, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not handle Operation Type 2 correctly, and the proposed fix resolves this issue.

**Final: False**
