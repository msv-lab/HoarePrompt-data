Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it is given an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard, and a list of `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function processes these test cases and returns the results accordingly.**
