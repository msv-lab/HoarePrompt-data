# Problem:
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

denote possible throw directions. Players who could have the ball after the
throw are highlighted in gray.

# Annotated Program:
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
t = func_2()
for i in range(t):
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. It seems to be a placeholder function that reads a line from standard input.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is the line read from standard input, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No relevant variables are present in the function signature for `func_2`. The function does not have any parameters and thus there are no preconditions related to its input variables.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters. It relies on the output of `func_1()` which is expected to return a string that can be split into a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were originally part of a string returned by `func_1()`, where the string was split into parts and each part was converted to an integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), and x is an integer representing the initial player with the ball (1 <= x <= n).
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)

        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':

    #State: ans is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `ans` is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws. If 0 was originally in `ans`, it is excluded, and `n` is included in `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: The code prints the length of the set `ans` after the modifications. The length is the number of players who have held the ball after all throws, excluding `0` if it was originally included, and including `n`.
    #
    #Output:
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted players (excluding 0 if originally present, including n) in ascending order
