The only variable in the loop head is `a`, and it iterates over `ans_list`. For the loop to execute, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. The state of `a` is determined by the elements in `ans_list`, so we only need to ensure that `ans_list` has at least one element.

State: **`ans_list` is a list that must have at least one element, `a` is the first element of `ans_list`**
