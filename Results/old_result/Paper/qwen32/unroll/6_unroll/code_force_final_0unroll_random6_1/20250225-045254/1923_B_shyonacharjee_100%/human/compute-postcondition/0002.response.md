Output State: **For each test case, the program will output either 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether it is possible to defeat all monsters with the given constraints. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` will retain their input values as they are not modified within the loop body. The variable `bullets_used` will be reset to 0 at the start of each test case iteration, and `can_survive` will be set to True. The list `monsters` is a sorted version of the zipped `x` and `a` lists based on the absolute value of `x`, and it will be recalculated for each test case.**
