The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the element `0` from the set `ans` if it is present. Given the initial state, `ans` is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws, and `0` is in `ans`. After executing the code, `0` will be removed from `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws, excluding 0.**
