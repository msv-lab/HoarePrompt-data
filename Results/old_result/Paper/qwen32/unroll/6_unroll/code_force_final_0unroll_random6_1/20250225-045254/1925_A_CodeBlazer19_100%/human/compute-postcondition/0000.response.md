The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state, `t` was already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676. After executing the code, `t` will hold the specific integer value provided by the input, which is still within the range 1 to 676. The other variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26.**
