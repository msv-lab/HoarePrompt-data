You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        arr = []

        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:

            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:

                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

    #State: For each test case, a list `ans` of `n` integers where the first `n-1` elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, and the last element is chosen such that the sum of all elements in `ans` equals `k`. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` from the initial conditions remain unchanged except that they have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of `n` integers where the first `n-1` elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, and the last element is chosen such that the sum of all elements in `ans` equals `k`. The function prints this list for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the sequence of integers sums up to \( k \) and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Sum of the sequence**:
   - The program constructs a sequence based on the binary representation of \( k \). However, it does not ensure that the sum of the constructed sequence equals \( k \). For example, consider the test case `2 5`:
     - The binary representation of 5 is `101`.
     - The program constructs the sequence `[1, 4]` (which corresponds to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of 5).
     - However, the sum of `[1, 4]` is 5, which is correct, but the program does not handle the case where \( n \) is greater than the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( k \) correctly.
     - For `2 5`, the program should output `5 0` or `4 1`, but it outputs `1 4`, which is not optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

2. **Maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR**:
   - The program does not ensure that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. For example, consider the test case `6 51`:
     - The binary representation of 51 is `110011`.
     - The program constructs the sequence `[1, 2, 5]` (which corresponds to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of 51).
     - However, the program does not distribute the remaining sum optimally to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
     - A better sequence could be `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]` as provided in the example, but the program does not guarantee this optimal distribution for all cases.

3. **Handling edge cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where \( n \) is equal to 1 correctly. For example, for the test case `1 5`, the program should output `5`, which it does correctly. However, the logic for handling larger \( n \) is flawed.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the sequence sums up to \( k \) and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. One possible approach is to distribute the remaining sum after constructing the initial sequence based on the binary representation of \( k \) in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

Given the identified issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
