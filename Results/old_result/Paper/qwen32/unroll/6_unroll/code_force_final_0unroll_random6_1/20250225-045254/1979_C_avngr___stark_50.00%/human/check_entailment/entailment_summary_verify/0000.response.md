### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness using the provided problem description, code, and function summaries.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Specifically, for each multiplier `k_i`, the bet `x_i` should satisfy:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
for all `i`.

#### Code Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Calculate the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the multipliers `k`:**
   - The LCM is calculated as the product of all `k_i` because the multipliers are integers between 2 and 20, and their product will be a common multiple.
2. **Determine the bets `x_i` as `m / k_i`:**
   - Here, `m` is the LCM.
   - This ensures that `x_i` are integers.
3. **Simplify the bets by dividing them by their GCD:**
   - The GCD of the bets is calculated using the `func_1` function.
   - Simplifying the bets ensures that the bets are in their simplest form.
4. **Check if the sum of the simplified bets is less than the simplified LCM:**
   - If `sum(c) >= m / hcf`, it means the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, so the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the simplified bets.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1(numbers)`: This function calculates the GCD of the numbers in the list `numbers`.

#### Verification with Example Inputs:
Let's verify the code with the provided example inputs:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```
   3
   3 2 7
   ```
   - LCM of 3, 2, 7 is 42.
   - Bets are `42/3`, `42/2`, `42/7` which are 14, 21, 6.
   - Simplified by GCD (which is 1) results in 14, 21, 6.
   - Sum of bets is 41, which is less than 42.
   - Output: `14 21 6` (Note: The code outputs `27 41 12`, which is also correct as it satisfies the condition).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```
   2
   3 3
   ```
   - LCM of 3, 3 is 3.
   - Bets are `3/3`, `3/3` which are 1, 1.
   - Simplified by GCD (which is 1) results in 1, 1.
   - Sum of bets is 2, which is less than 3.
   - Output: `1 1` (Matches the example).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   ```
   5
   5 5 5 5 5
   ```
   - LCM of 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 is 5.
   - Bets are `5/5`, `5/5`, `5/5`, `5/5`, `5/5` which are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.
   - Simplified by GCD (which is 1) results in 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.
   - Sum of bets is 5, which is not less than 5.
   - Output: `-1` (Matches the example).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   ```
   6
   7 9 3 17 9 13
   ```
   - LCM of 7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13 is 4389.
   - Bets are `4389/7`, `4389/9`, `4389/3`, `4389/17`, `4389/9`, `4389/13` which are 627, 487, 1463, 258, 487, 337.
   - Simplified by GCD (which is 1) results in 627, 487, 1463, 258, 487, 337.
   - Sum of bets is 3649, which is less than 4389.
   - Output: `627 487 1463 258 487 337` (Note: The code outputs `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071`, which is also correct as it satisfies the condition).

5. **Test Case 5:**
   ```
   3
   6 3 2
   ```
   - LCM of 6, 3, 2 is 6.
   - Bets are `6/6`, `6/3`, `6/2` which are 1, 2, 3.
   - Simplified by GCD (which is 1) results in 1, 2, 3.
   - Sum of bets is 6, which is not less than 6.
   - Output: `-1` (Matches the example).

6. **Test Case 6:**
   ```
   5
   9 4 6 8 3
   ```
   - LCM of 9, 4, 6, 8, 3 is 72.
   - Bets are `72/9`, `72/4`, `72/6`, `72/8`, `72/3` which are 8, 18, 12, 9, 24.
   - Simplified by GCD (which is 1) results in 8, 18, 12, 9, 24.
   - Sum of bets is 71, which is less than 72.
   - Output: `8 18 12 9 24` (Matches the example).

#### Conclusion:
The code correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The code handles all the test cases correctly and produces the expected results.

**Final: True**
