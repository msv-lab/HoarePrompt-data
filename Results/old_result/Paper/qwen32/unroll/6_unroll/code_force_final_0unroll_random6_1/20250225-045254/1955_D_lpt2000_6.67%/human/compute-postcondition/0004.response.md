Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates how many times a certain condition (the number of common elements between a sliding window of size `m` in list `a` and list `b` is at least `k`) is met and prints the result for each test case.**
