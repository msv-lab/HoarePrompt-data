You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= n, `p_i` != i for all i in [1, n]; `v` is a list of integers where `v[0]` is 0 and `v[1]` to `v[n]` are the integers read from the input.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. It checks if there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i]] == i`. If such an index exists, it prints `2` and terminates. Otherwise, it prints `3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least two friends attend the party. A friend will attend if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` where `p[i]` is the best friend of the i-th friend.

2. **Logic for Determining Minimum Invitations**:
   - The program initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros and then populates it with the input values for `p`.
   - It then iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - For each friend `i`, it checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition checks if friend `i` and their best friend `v[i]` are best friends of each other (i.e., they form a mutual best friend relationship).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that only two invitations are needed to ensure both friends attend.
   - If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Mutual Best Friend Pair**: If a mutual best friend pair exists (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`), then sending invitations to these two friends guarantees that both will attend. This is correct as per the problem statement.
- **No Mutual Best Friend Pair**: If no such pair exists, the program assumes that at least three invitations are needed. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, consider a scenario where there are three friends and their best friends are arranged in a cycle (e.g., `p = [2, 3, 1]`). In this case, sending invitations to any two friends will ensure that at least two friends attend. Therefore, the program's assumption that three invitations are needed in the absence of a mutual pair is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly assumes that three invitations are needed whenever there is no mutual best friend pair. This is not always true, as demonstrated by the counterexample above. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
