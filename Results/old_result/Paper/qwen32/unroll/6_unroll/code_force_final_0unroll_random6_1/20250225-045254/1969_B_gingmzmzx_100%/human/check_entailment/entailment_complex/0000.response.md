### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to calculate the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each binary string one by one.
2. **Counting Zeros**: For each binary string, it counts the total number of zeros.
3. **Count Array**: It initializes a count array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It iterates through each character in the string.
   - If the character is a 0, it checks if there have been any 1s encountered before it (`cnt[1] > 0`). If so, it increments the cost `ans` by 1 because moving this 0 past a 1 will require a shift.
   - If the character is a 1, it adds the number of remaining zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost `ans`. This is because moving this 1 past all remaining zeros will require a shift for each of those zeros.
5. **Output**: After processing each string, it prints the calculated cost `ans`.

### Analysis:
The logic of the program is based on the fact that the minimum cost to sort a binary string is determined by the number of inversions (0s that appear after 1s). Each inversion can be resolved by performing a cyclic shift, and the cost of each shift is effectively the number of elements being shifted. The program efficiently calculates this by keeping track of the number of 1s encountered before each 0 and the number of 0s remaining after each 1.

The provided example outputs match the expected results based on this logic, indicating that the program correctly computes the minimum cost for sorting each binary string.

### Conclusion:
Given the reasoning and the matching example outputs, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
