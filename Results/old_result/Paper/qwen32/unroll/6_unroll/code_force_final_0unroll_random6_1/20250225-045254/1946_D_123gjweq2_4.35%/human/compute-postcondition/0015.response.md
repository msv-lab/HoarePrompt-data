Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` that were appended during the loop, `xor` is 0. The `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0. `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`**
