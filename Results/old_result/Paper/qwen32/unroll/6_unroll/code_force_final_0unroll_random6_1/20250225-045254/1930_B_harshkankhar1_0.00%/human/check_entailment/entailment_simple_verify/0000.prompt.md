You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #This is printed: a (where a is the list of integers from 1 to n with elements at even indices reversed)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation that satisfies the given conditions. Let's analyze the problem and the code:

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)
```

The function `func_1` generates a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices. However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated permutation will satisfy the given condition.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `n = 4`. The code will generate the permutation `[1, 2, 4, 3]` (by reversing the elements at even indices `[1, 3]` to `[3, 1]`).

Let's verify this permutation:
- \( p_1 = 1 \), \( p_2 = 2 \), \( p_3 = 4 \), \( p_4 = 3 \)
- Here, \( p_1 = 1 \) divides \( p_3 = 4 \) and \( p_2 = 2 \) divides \( p_4 = 3 \) is not true, but we need to check for all pairs.
- However, \( p_1 = 1 \) divides \( p_2 = 2 \) and \( p_2 = 2 \) divides \( p_4 = 2 \) is not true, but \( p_2 = 2 \) divides \( p_3 = 4 \) and \( p_3 = 4 \) divides \( p_4 = 3 \) is not true.
- But, let's check another pair: \( p_2 = 2 \) divides \( p_4 = 2 \) is not true, but \( p_3 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \), but we need to check other pairs properly.

However, let's consider another example `n = 6`:
- The code will generate the permutation `[1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6]` (by reversing the elements at even indices `[1, 3, 5]` to `[5, 3, 1]`).
- Here, \( p_1 = 1 \), \( p_2 = 2 \), \( p_3 = 5 \), \( p_4 = 4 \), \( p_5 = 3 \), \( p_6 = 6 \)
- \( p_2 = 2 \) divides \( p_4 = 4 \) and \( p_3 = 5 \) does not divide \( p_5 = 3 \), but \( p_4 = 4 \) divides \( p_6 = 6 \).

Thus, the permutation `[1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6]` fails the condition because \( p_2 = 2 \) divides \( p_4 = 4 \) and \( p_4 = 4 \) divides \( p_6 = 6 \).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not guarantee a valid permutation for all possible values of \( n \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
