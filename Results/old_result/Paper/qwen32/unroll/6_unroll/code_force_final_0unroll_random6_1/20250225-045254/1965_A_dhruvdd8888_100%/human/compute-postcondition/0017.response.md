Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. It processes each test case to determine the winner of a game (either Alice or Bob) based on the differences between the sorted number of stones in the piles, and prints the winner for each test case.**
