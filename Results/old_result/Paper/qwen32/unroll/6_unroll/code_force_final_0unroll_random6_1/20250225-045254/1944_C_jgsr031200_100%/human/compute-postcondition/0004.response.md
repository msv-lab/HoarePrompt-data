To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range function depends on `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is set appropriately to allow the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n` inclusive.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 0. However, based on the initial state provided, `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`, with `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
- `freq` is a list where the i-th element represents the number of times the integer `i-1` appears in `arr`.
- `cou` is 0.

Since `n` is already specified to be in the range `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, it satisfies the requirement for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust its state.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the variables in the loop head.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`, with `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`; `freq` is a list where the i-th element represents the number of times the integer `i-1` appears in `arr`; `cou` is 0; `n` is in the range `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`**
