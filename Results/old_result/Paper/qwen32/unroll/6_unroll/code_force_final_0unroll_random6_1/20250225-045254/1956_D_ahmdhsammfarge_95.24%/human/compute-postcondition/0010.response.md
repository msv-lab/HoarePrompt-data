Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r` and `l` which are integers representing a range within the list `lst`, and `lst` which is a list of integers. It also accepts `ops` which is a list that will store the operations performed. The function modifies the list `lst` by setting all elements from index `r` to `l` to the value `n` (where `n` is `l - r + 1`) and returns the modified list `lst`.**
