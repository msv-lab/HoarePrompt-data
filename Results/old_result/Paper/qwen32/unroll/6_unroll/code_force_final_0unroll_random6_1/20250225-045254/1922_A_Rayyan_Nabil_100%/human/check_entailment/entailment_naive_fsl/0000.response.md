Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only checks if there is at least one position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not ensure that for all positions, the conditions of the template are satisfied.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
2
ab
ba
aa
```
In this case, the program will return "YES" because at position 0, `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`. However, this does not mean there exists a valid template for the entire string. For the second position, `a[1] == c[1]` and `b[1] == c[1]`, which means there is no valid template that can satisfy the conditions for both positions simultaneously.

A correct approach would involve checking each position to ensure that there exists a template character that satisfies the conditions for both `a` and `b` while not satisfying the conditions for `c`.
