### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis

Kirill wants to be among the first `m` people in the queue with the minimum cost. He can bribe people to swap positions with him, paying `a[j]` coins to swap with the person at position `j` and `b[k]` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position `i`.

#### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem with the following logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lists `a` and `b`.
3. It then calls `func_1` with the initial `pergunta` set to infinity, the lists `a` and `b`, and the values `n` and `m`.
4. In `func_1`, it initializes `x` to 0.
5. It iterates through the list `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
6. If the current index `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
7. It adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.
8. Finally, it prints `pergunta`.

#### Correctness Evaluation

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

- **Ignoring `b_k` Costs**: The program does not account for the cost `b[k]` for each person `k` between `j` and `i` when Kirill swaps positions with the person at position `j`. The cost of a swap should include the sum of `a[j]` and all `b[k]` for `j < k < i`.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_1` does not account for the fact that Kirill can perform multiple swaps to reach a position among the first `m` people with the minimum cost. The current approach only considers single swaps and does not explore all possible swap sequences.
- **Lack of Dynamic Programming or Priority Queue**: The program does not use a dynamic programming approach or a priority queue to efficiently keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Given these issues, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect as it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
