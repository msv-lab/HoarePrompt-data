The provided code snippet initializes the variable `neg` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or `s`. The variable `n` still represents the length of the string `s`, and `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.

Output State: **`n` is a single integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'; `neg` is 0.**
