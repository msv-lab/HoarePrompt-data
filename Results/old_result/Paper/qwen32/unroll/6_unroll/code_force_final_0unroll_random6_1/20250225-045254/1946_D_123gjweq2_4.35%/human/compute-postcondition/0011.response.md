To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables. The code snippet is:

```python
thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30.
- `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` that were appended during the loop.
- `xor` is 0.
- `thing1` is 0.
- The `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0.

The function `find_max` is called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. The function `find_max` presumably returns the maximum value from `new_arr` considering the `bit - 1` position. However, the exact implementation of `find_max` is not provided, so we can only assume it returns a value based on the specified criteria.

Thus, after the execution of the code snippet, the value of `thing1` will be the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` that were appended during the loop, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0.**
