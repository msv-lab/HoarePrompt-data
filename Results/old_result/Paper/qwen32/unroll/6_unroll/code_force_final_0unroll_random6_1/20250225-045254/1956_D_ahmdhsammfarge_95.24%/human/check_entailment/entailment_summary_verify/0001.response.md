### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- **Purpose**: The function aims to find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` to replace with its MEX to maximize the sum.
- **Implementation Issue**: The function attempts to compute the new sum if a subarray were replaced by its MEX, but it does this incorrectly. Instead of calculating the MEX, it calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray. This is fundamentally flawed because the MEX is not necessarily related to the length of the subarray but to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
- **Conclusion**: This function does not correctly identify the optimal subarray to replace.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: The function seems intended to generate a sequence of operations to set all elements in a subarray to a specific value.
- **Implementation Issue**: The function's implementation is recursive and repetitive, and it does not correctly generate the sequence of operations needed to set all elements in the subarray to a specific value. The operations it generates are not aligned with the problem's requirements.
- **Conclusion**: This function does not correctly generate the required operations.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: The function is supposed to perform the actual replacement of the subarray `[r, l]` with its MEX and update the list and operations accordingly.
- **Implementation Issue**: Similar to `func_1`, it does not compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it sets all elements in the subarray to the length of the subarray. This is incorrect because the MEX is not the length of the subarray but the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
- **Conclusion**: This function does not correctly perform the replacement with the MEX.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The code does not correctly compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it uses the length of the subarray to replace its elements.
2. **Incorrect Operation Generation**: The operations generated by `func_2` and `func_3` are not correct and do not correspond to the intended MEX replacement.
3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in `func_1` for finding the optimal subarray to replace is flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX.

### Final Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not properly compute the MEX of subarrays and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array. The original assessment accurately identifies these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
