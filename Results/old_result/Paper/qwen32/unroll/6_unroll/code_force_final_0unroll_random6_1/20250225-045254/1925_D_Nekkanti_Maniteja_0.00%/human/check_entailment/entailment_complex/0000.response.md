Let's analyze the given program and determine whether it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires us to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Key Points:

1. **Initial Friendship Values**: We are given `m` pairs of friends with their initial friendship values.
2. **Random Selection**: In each excursion, a pair of children is chosen randomly, and if they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.

### Program Analysis:

The program processes each test case separately. For each test case, it initializes some variables and reads the input values. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: This is the modulus value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`: This calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)`. However, the calculation `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` is incorrect because it should be `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.
   - `s = 0`: This will store the sum of expected friendship values.
   - `a = 0`: This will accumulate the initial sum of friendship values.

2. **Reading Friendships**:
   - For each of the `m` friendships, the program reads the pair `(u, v)` and their friendship value `f`, and adds `f` to `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Value**:
   - For each of the `k` excursions, the program updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula seems incorrect and does not correctly compute the expected value.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` instead of `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is incorrect and will lead to wrong results.

2. **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used to update `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation involves more complex probability and summation, which is not correctly implemented in the program.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the program, it is clear that the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
