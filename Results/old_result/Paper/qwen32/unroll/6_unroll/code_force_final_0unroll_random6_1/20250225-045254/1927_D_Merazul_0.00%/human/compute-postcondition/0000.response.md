The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is typically used to read multiple integers from a single line of input.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, and `r` are described, but none of these are directly affected by the provided code snippet. The only change introduced by the code is the definition of the lambda function `R`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a tuple of integers.**
