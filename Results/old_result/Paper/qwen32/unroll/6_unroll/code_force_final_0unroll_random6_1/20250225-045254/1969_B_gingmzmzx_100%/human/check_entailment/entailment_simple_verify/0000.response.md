### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations. The logic in the function `func_1` does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts accurately.

Let's analyze the code and the provided example in detail:

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `zeroes` is the count of `0`s in the string.
   - `cnt` is an array to keep track of the count of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far.
   - `ans` is initialized to `0` to accumulate the cost.

2. **Iteration through the string:**
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - Increment the count of `c` in `cnt`.
     - If `c` is `0` and there have been any `1`s encountered (`cnt[1] > 0`), increment `ans` by `1`.
     - If `c` is `1`, add the number of remaining `0`s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the input string `101011`:
- Initialize `zeroes` to `3`.
- Initialize `cnt` to `[0, 0]`.
- Initialize `ans` to `0`.

Iterate through the string:
- **First character `1`:**
  - Increment `cnt[1]` to `1`.
  - Since `c` is `1`, add `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`. Here, `zeroes` is `3` and `cnt[0]` is `0`, so `ans` becomes `3`.
  
- **Second character `0`:**
  - Increment `cnt[0]` to `1`.
  - Since `c` is `0` and `cnt[1]` is `1`, increment `ans` by `1`. So, `ans` becomes `4`.
  
- **Third character `1`:**
  - Increment `cnt[1]` to `2`.
  - Since `c` is `1`, add `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`. Here, `zeroes` is `3` and `cnt[0]` is `1`, so `ans` becomes `6`.
  
- **Fourth character `0`:**
  - Increment `cnt[0]` to `2`.
  - Since `c` is `0` and `cnt[1]` is `2`, increment `ans` by `1`. So, `ans` becomes `7`.
  
- **Fifth character `1`:**
  - Increment `cnt[1]` to `3`.
  - Since `c` is `1`, add `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`. Here, `zeroes` is `3` and `cnt[0]` is `2`, so `ans` becomes `8`.
  
- **Sixth character `1`:**
  - Increment `cnt[1]` to `4`.
  - Since `c` is `1`, add `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`. Here, `zeroes` is `3` and `cnt[0]` is `2`, so `ans` becomes `11`.

The final value of `ans` is `11`, which is not the correct minimum cost of `5`.

#### Correctness:
The provided code does not accurately compute the minimum cost for cyclic shifts required to sort the string. The logic for calculating the cost is flawed, as it does not correctly simulate the cost of the operations described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
