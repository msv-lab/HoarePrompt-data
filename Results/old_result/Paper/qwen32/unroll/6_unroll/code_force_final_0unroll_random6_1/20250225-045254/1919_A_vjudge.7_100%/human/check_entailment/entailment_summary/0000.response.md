### Reasoning:
The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have, with the outcome depending on whether the sum of the coins is even or odd. Specifically:

- If the sum of the coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins.
- If the sum of the coins (a + b) is odd, Alice wins.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by reading multiple test cases, calculating the sum of coins for each case, and then determining the winner based on the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum. The use of the bitwise AND operation (`& 1`) is an efficient way to check if a number is odd, as any odd number will have its least significant bit set to 1, resulting in `(a + b) & 1` being 1 for odd sums and 0 for even sums.

### Correctness:
The program accurately follows the rules of the game and correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the sum of the coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
