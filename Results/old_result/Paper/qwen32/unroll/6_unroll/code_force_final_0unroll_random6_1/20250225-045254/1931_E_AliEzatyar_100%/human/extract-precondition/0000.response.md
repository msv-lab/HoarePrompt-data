Precondition: **num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the number of integers in the list, the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and the list of integers given to Anna, respectively. The constraints are 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each integer in the list. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
