You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these integers and prints the result minus two.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem description for all possible inputs within the given constraints. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution:

### Problem Description
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

### Analysis
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Loop through each test case**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. **Loop through each possible value of \(b\)**: For each test case, it loops through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. **Calculate \(x\)**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = \left(\frac{a - i(i-1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\).
4. **Check if \(x\) is positive**: If \(x\) is positive, it adds \(x\) to the sum.
5. **Check additional condition**: If \((a - i(i-1)) \mod i^2 = 0\) and \(i(i-1) \mod i^2 = 0\), it adds 1 more to the sum.
6. **Print the result**: Finally, it prints the sum minus 2.

### Issues and Edge Cases
1. **Incorrect Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` is used in the calculation of `x`, but it should be `b` instead.
2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The conditions to add 1 more to the sum are incorrect and do not align with the problem description.
3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program incorrectly uses `i` instead of `b` in the calculation of `x`. Additionally, the conditions to add 1 more to the sum are incorrect and do not align with the problem description. The sum calculation does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To fix the program, the logic needs to be revised to correctly count the valid pairs based on the problem description.
