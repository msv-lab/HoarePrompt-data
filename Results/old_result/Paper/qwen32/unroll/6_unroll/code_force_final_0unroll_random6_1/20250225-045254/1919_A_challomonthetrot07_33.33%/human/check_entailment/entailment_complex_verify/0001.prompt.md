You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

    #State: A series of printed results ('Alice' or 'Bob') corresponding to each test case. The variables `T`, `a`, and `b` will be in their final state, with `T` unchanged and `a` and `b` holding the values from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions related to the values of `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around two players, Alice and Bob, who have a certain number of coins in their wallets. They take turns, with Alice going first. Each turn consists of two steps:
1. The player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
2. The player must remove one coin from their current wallet.

The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty when it's their turn) loses. Both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- If both players have the same number of coins, Bob wins because Alice will always be the one to make the last move (since she starts first).
- If Alice starts with only one coin, she will lose because no matter what she does, she'll be the one to empty her wallet first.
- If Bob starts with only one coin, he will lose for the same reason.
- If the number of coins in Alice's wallet is odd, Bob will win. This is because Alice can always force Bob to face an even number of coins, and Bob will eventually be forced to face 1 coin and lose.
- If the number of coins in Alice's wallet is even and the number of coins in Bob's wallet is odd, Alice will win. This is because Alice can always force Bob to face an odd number of coins, and Bob will eventually be forced to face 1 coin and lose.
- If Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by always maintaining an even number of coins for Alice and an odd number of coins for himself.
- If Bob has more coins than Alice, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by always maintaining an odd number of coins for Bob and an even number of coins for herself.

### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the program's logic:
- If `a == b`, it correctly prints "Bob".
- If `a == 1`, it correctly prints "Alice".
- If `b == 1`, it correctly prints "Bob".
- If `a % 2 == 1`, it correctly prints "Bob".
- If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`, it correctly prints "Alice".
- The remaining conditions (`a > b` and `else`) don't correctly cover all scenarios. For example, if `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`, the program doesn't handle this case correctly. It should consider the total parity of coins and the starting player's advantage.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when both `a` and `b` are even. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 2`, the program would incorrectly print "Alice" when the correct answer is "Bob". Therefore, the program is not correct for all scenarios described in the problem.
