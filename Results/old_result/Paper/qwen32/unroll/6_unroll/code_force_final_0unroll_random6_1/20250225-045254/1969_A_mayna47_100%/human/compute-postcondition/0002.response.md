The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and then creates a new list `v` by prepending a `0` to this list of integers. The initial state specifies that `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to `0`. This list is then overwritten by the new list created in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= n, `p_i` != i for all i in [1, n]; `v` is a list of integers where `v[0]` is 0 and `v[1]` to `v[n]` are the integers read from the input.**
