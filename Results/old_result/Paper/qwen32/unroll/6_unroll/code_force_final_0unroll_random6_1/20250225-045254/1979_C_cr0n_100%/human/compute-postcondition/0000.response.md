The code snippet `N = int(input().strip())` reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts the input to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `N`. This affects the value of `N` but does not change the description of `vals` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value input by the user, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the corresponding outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20.**
