Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` satisfies `1 <= p_i <= n` and `p_i != i` for all `i` in the range `[1, n]`. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the given constraints, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
