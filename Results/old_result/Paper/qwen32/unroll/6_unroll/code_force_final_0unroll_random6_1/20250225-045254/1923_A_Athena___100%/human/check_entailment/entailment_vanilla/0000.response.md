Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to move chips in such a way that they form a single block without any free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required to achieve this should be calculated for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Initial Cleaning**:
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is correct because leading and trailing zeros do not affect the relative positions of the chips within the block.

3. **Counting Operations**:
   - The program then iterates through the cleaned list `a` and counts the number of zeros. This count represents the number of free cells within the block of chips, which directly translates to the number of operations needed to move the chips to form a contiguous block. This is because each free cell within the block needs to be filled by moving a chip from the right.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of operations for each test case.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After cleaning: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Count of zeros: `1`
   - Expected Output: `1`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After cleaning: `1`
   - Count of zeros: `0`
   - Expected Output: `0`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After cleaning: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Count of zeros: `0`
   - Expected Output: `0`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
   - After cleaning: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Count of zeros: `2`
   - Expected Output: `2`

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After cleaning: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Count of zeros: `3`
   - Expected Output: `3`

The program produces the expected output for all test cases, indicating that it correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
