You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code:

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the strings a, b, and c, and a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: the function returns None.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` where `n` is a positive integer, and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there is any position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. If no such position exists after checking all positions, it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 20), a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: n is the integer value read in the last iteration, a is the string read in the last iteration, b is the string read in the last iteration, c is the string read in the last iteration, t is the same as the initial value, results is a list of results from each func_1 call.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: n is the integer value read in the last iteration, a is the string read in the last iteration, b is the string read in the last iteration, c is the string read in the last iteration, t is the same as the initial value, results is a list of results from each func_1 call.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20 inclusive. It processes these strings using the function `func_1` and collects the results. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program in detail to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:

- We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
  - Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - String `c` does not match the template `t`.

- For a string to match a template:
  - If the template character is lowercase, the corresponding string character must be the same.
  - If the template character is uppercase, the corresponding string character must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**:
   - This function iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It checks if `a[i]` is different from `c[i]` and `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position is found, it returns `'YES'`, indicating that a template exists where `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not.
   - If no such position is found after the loop, it returns `'NO'`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness of the Provided Program:

The provided program is incorrect. Here's why:

- The logic inside `func_1` is flawed. The function checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient to determine if a template exists where `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.
- The template can have uppercase letters, which would mean that `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character at position `i`.
- The provided logic does not consider the possibility of using uppercase letters in the template to ensure `a` and `b` match while `c` does not.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to construct a template `t` such that:
- For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), ensuring `c[i]` does not match.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), ensuring both `a` and `b` match while `c` does not if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine the existence of such a template. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
