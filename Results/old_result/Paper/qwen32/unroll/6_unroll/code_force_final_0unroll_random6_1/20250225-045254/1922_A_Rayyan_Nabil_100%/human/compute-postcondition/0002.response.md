The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The state of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `results` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
