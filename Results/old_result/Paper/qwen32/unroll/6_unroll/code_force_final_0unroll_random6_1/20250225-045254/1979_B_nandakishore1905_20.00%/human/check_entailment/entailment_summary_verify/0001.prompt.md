You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the difference between `n` and `m` and prints this value. The printed value is determined by specific conditions related to the difference being a power of two, or whether one of the integers is zero and the other is odd or even.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the length of the longest common subsegment of two infinite sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) defined as:
- \(a_n = n \oplus x\)
- \(b_n = n \oplus y\)

Where \(\oplus\) denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

The key insight is to recognize that the sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) are essentially shifted versions of each other due to the XOR operation. The length of the longest common subsegment can be derived from the properties of the XOR operation.

### Observations

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\)
   - The difference \(a_n - b_n = (n \oplus x) - (n \oplus y) = x \oplus y\)
   - The value of \(x \oplus y\) determines the periodicity and structure of the sequences.

2. **Longest Common Subsegment**:
   - The longest common subsegment length is related to the highest power of 2 that divides \(x \oplus y\).
   - If \(k = x \oplus y\), then the length of the longest common subsegment is \(2^p\) where \(p\) is the highest power of 2 in the binary representation of \(k\).

### Program Analysis

The program provided attempts to solve the problem based on the following logic:
- It calculates \(k = |x - y|\), which is incorrect. It should be \(k = x \oplus y\).
- It then checks if \(k\) is a power of 2 using the condition \(k \& (k - 1) == 0\). If true, it prints \(k\).
- It handles special cases where \(n = 0\) and \(m\) is odd or even, which is not generally correct.
- It calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and prints \(k - q\), which is also incorrect.

### Correctness

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the longest common subsegment. Here are the issues:
- It uses the absolute difference instead of XOR.
- It incorrectly handles special cases.
- It does not correctly compute the longest common subsegment length based on the highest power of 2 in the XOR result.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x ^ y  # Correctly compute the XOR
        # Find the highest power of 2 that divides k
        if k == 0:
            print(0)  # This case should not occur as x != y
        else:
            p = 1
            while (k & 1) == 0:
                k >>= 1
                p <<= 1
            print(p)

func()
```

The provided program is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
