You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = a[0]
        res = n - 1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        ans += res
        ans_list.append(ans)
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the given inputs. The final state of the program is that it outputs the calculated `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score based on the problem description. The core issue is that the program does not correctly handle the logic for forming permutations of length `n` after purchasing additional cards.

Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The program calculates `ans` as the sum of the minimum card counts plus the distributed additional cards. However, this does not directly translate to the number of valid permutations of length `n`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Coins (`k`)**:
   - The program attempts to distribute the remaining coins evenly among the card types, but this does not guarantee that the resulting arrangement will maximize the number of valid permutations.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`**:
   - This line seems to be an incorrect attempt to calculate the number of valid permutations, but it does not correctly account for the distribution of cards or the constraints of forming permutations.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans += res`**:
   - The variable `res` is used to keep track of some form of count but is not correctly integrated into the final score calculation.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we are maximizing the number of valid permutations of length `n` by optimally distributing the additional cards. This involves more complex logic than what is currently implemented in the program.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation:**
- With 3 cards of each type (1, 2, 3) and 3 additional coins, we can buy 1 more card of each type, resulting in 4 cards of each type.
- We can arrange the cards in 4! / (4! / (4!)) = 6 different permutations of length 3.

**Program Output:**
- The program might output a different value because it does not correctly handle the distribution of additional cards to maximize permutations.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
