You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1

    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. x is a list of n integers where each element x_i satisfies -n <= x_i <= n, x_i != 0, and the elements are strictly increasing (x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n).

    #State: For each test case, the program will output either 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether it is possible to defeat all monsters with the given constraints. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` will retain their input values as they are not modified within the loop body. The variable `bullets_used` will be reset to 0 at the start of each test case iteration, and `can_survive` will be set to True. The list `monsters` is a sorted version of the zipped `x` and `a` lists based on the absolute value of `x`, and it will be recalculated for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of monsters `n`, a bullet limit `k`, a list of monster health values `a`, and a list of monster positions `x`. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters using the given constraints and outputs 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the monsters move towards the character every second after taking damage. The logic in the program incorrectly assumes that the bullets used can be accumulated and compared against the distance times `k` without considering the movement of the monsters.

Here is a specific case where the program will fail:

### Test Case:
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

### Explanation of the Test Case:
- There are 3 monsters with health `[1, 2, 3]` at positions `[-1, 2, 3]`.
- The player can fire up to 2 bullets per second.

### Correct Execution:
1. **First Second:**
   - Fire 1 bullet at the monster at position -1 (health 1 -> 0, dies).
   - Fire 1 bullet at the monster at position 3 (health 3 -> 2).
   - Monsters move: Position -1 monster dies, position 2 monster moves to 1, position 3 monster moves to 2.
   - Monsters now at positions `[1, 2]` with health `[2, 2]`.

2. **Second Second:**
   - Fire 2 bullets at the monster at position 1 (health 2 -> 0, dies).
   - Monsters move: Position 2 monster moves to 1.
   - Monsters now at positions `[1]` with health `[2]`.

3. **Third Second:**
   - Fire 2 bullets at the monster at position 1 (health 2 -> 0, dies).
   - Monsters move: No monsters left.
   - Result: `YES`.

### Incorrect Execution by the Program:
- The program calculates the total bullets needed as `1 + 2 + 3 = 6` and compares it against `distance * k = (1 + 2 + 3) * 2 = 12`.
- Since `6 < 12`, the program incorrectly concludes that the player can survive and kill all monsters, resulting in `YES`.

### Correct Output:
The correct output for this test case should be `YES`, but the program might fail in other scenarios where the cumulative bullets needed exceed the available bullets due to monster movement.

### Another Failing Test Case:
```
1
2 1
2 2
-1 1
```

### Explanation of the Second Test Case:
- There are 2 monsters with health `[2, 2]` at positions `[-1, 1]`.
- The player can fire only 1 bullet per second.

### Correct Execution:
1. **First Second:**
   - Fire 1 bullet at the monster at position -1 (health 2 -> 1).
   - Fire 1 bullet at the monster at position 1 (health 2 -> 1).
   - Monsters move: Position -1 monster moves to 0, position 1 monster moves to 0.
   - Result: `NO` (both monsters reach the player).

### Incorrect Execution by the Program:
- The program calculates the total bullets needed as `2 + 2 = 4` and compares it against `distance * k = (1 + 1) * 1 = 2`.
- Since `4 > 2`, the program correctly concludes that the player cannot survive, resulting in `NO`.

However, the logic flaw in handling cumulative bullets and monster movement can lead to incorrect results in other scenarios.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling monster movement and cumulative bullets.
