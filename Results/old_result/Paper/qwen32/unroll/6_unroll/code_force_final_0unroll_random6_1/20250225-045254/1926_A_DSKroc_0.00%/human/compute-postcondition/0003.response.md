Postcondition: **After the loop executes all the iterations, for each of the `t` test cases, the variables `ac` and `bc` hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the string `s` of that test case. The variable `s` holds the last input string processed, and `q` holds the value `t-1`. The initial value of `t` and the distinct strings provided as input remain unchanged. The current value of `ac` is greater than the current value of `bc`.**
