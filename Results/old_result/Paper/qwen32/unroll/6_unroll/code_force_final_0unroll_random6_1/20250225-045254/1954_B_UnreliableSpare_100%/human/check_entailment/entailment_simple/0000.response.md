### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Initial Check for Uniformity**: The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because a uniform array remains beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.

2. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Sequence Length**:
   - The program then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the first element (`arr[0]`).
   - It keeps track of the count of consecutive occurrences of `arr[0]` and updates the minimum count (`ans`) whenever it encounters a different element.
   - Finally, it compares the last counted sequence of `arr[0]` with the current minimum and updates `ans` accordingly.

3. **Output**:
   - If all elements are the same, it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the first element.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Minimum Consecutive Sequence Length**: The program only considers the first element and its consecutive occurrences. This is insufficient because the array can have multiple segments of different elements, and the minimum consecutive sequence length needed to break the beauty might not be related to the first element.
- **General Case Handling**: The program does not handle the general case where the array has multiple segments of different elements and requires a more sophisticated approach to determine the minimum removals.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program is not correctly handling the general case of finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The logic needs to be more comprehensive to cover all possible scenarios.

**Correctness: False**

The program fails to correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove for arrays that have multiple segments of different elements. It only considers the first element and its consecutive occurrences, which is not sufficient for the problem's requirements.
