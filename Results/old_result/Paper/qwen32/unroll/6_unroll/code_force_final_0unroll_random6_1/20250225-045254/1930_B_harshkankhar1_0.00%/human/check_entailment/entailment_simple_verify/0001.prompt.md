You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)
    #This is printed: a (where a is the list of integers from 1 to n with elements at even indices reversed)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to generate a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

### Program Analysis

The provided program does the following:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
3. Inside `func_1`, it generates a list of numbers from 1 to n.
4. It reverses the elements at even indices of the list.
5. It prints the modified list.

Let's consider how this approach might work for different values of n:

#### Example 1: n = 4
- Initial list: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- After reversing elements at even indices (0, 2, ...): [4, 2, 3, 1]
- This results in the permutation: [4, 2, 3, 1]

Let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- There are no pairs (i, j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

#### Example 2: n = 3
- Initial list: [1, 2, 3]
- After reversing elements at even indices (0, 2, ...): [3, 2, 1]
- This results in the permutation: [3, 2, 1]

Let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- There are no pairs (i, j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

### General Case Analysis

The provided program's approach of reversing the elements at even indices does not guarantee that the condition will always be satisfied for all possible values of n. To prove this, let's consider a larger example:

#### Example 3: n = 6
- Initial list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- After reversing elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...): [6, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1]
- This results in the permutation: [6, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1]

However, this list is not a valid permutation because it contains duplicate elements (4 appears twice). This violates the requirement that the permutation must consist of distinct integers from 1 to n.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation for all values of n due to the following reasons:
1. It does not guarantee that the condition of no two distinct indices i and j satisfying p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} will always be met.
2. It can produce invalid permutations with duplicate elements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
