Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, representing the size of the array, Polycarp's favorite integers, and the elements of the array, respectively. The constraints are 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in the lists a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged. A new variable `results` is initialized as an empty list.
