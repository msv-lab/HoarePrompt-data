In the provided task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The state before the loop starts includes:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- Each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99)

However, the loop variable `n` is not defined in the state before the loop starts, and there is no direct relationship provided between `n` and the other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`).

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to define `n` such that the range function will generate at least one iteration. This means `n` must be greater than 0.

The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized by the `range` function, so we do not need to set it before the loop starts.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `n`. We should set `n` to a value greater than 0. Since no specific relationship between `n` and the other variables is given, we can choose any positive integer for `n`. For simplicity, let's choose `n` to be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99); `n` is 1**
