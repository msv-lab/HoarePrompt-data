Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine if a given list can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation on the list. Here's an analysis of the program logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the length of the list and the list itself.

2. **Operation Attempt**: The program then iterates over the list to check if a number is greater than the next number and greater than or equal to 10. If both conditions are met, it attempts to split the number into its digits and insert them back into the list at the same position. However, there are a few issues with this approach:
   - The operation is only performed if the current element is greater than the next element and is greater than or equal to 10. This means that the program does not handle cases where the array needs to be rearranged in a more complex way.
   - The operation is only attempted once per pair of elements, which is not sufficient to guarantee that the list can be sorted by repeatedly splitting numbers.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**: After attempting to perform the operation, the program checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. If the list is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, the program's approach to sorting the list by splitting numbers is flawed. It does not guarantee that the list will be sorted after performing the operations, and it does not handle all possible cases where the list can be sorted by splitting numbers.

For example, consider the test case `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will not be able to sort this list because it only attempts to split numbers when the current number is greater than the next number and greater than or equal to 10. In this case, it will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is still not sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
