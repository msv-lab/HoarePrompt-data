Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list and checking if an element is greater than the next one and greater than 10. If so, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the list. However, this logic is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Single Pass Limitation**: The program only makes a single pass through the list and only splits an element if it is greater than the next one and greater than 10. This means it might not handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where splits need to occur earlier in the list to allow subsequent elements to be split correctly.

2. **No Re-checking**: After splitting an element, the program does not re-check the order of the list or the newly inserted elements. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about whether the list is sorted.

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Splitting**: The program does not ensure that all elements that need to be split are split. It only splits elements when they are greater than the next element, which might not be the only condition that requires splitting.

4. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The splitting logic (`a // 10` and `a % 10`) is only suitable for two-digit numbers. If the number is a single digit or more than two digits, this logic will not work correctly.

5. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called after the loop, but it does not guarantee that the list is in a state where no more splits are needed. It simply checks if the current state of the list is sorted.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as repeatedly checking and splitting elements until no more splits are possible, and then checking if the list is sorted.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
