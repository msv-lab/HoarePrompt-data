The provided code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. However, the provided code does not affect `t`, `x`, or `y`. It only introduces a new variable `n` with the value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
