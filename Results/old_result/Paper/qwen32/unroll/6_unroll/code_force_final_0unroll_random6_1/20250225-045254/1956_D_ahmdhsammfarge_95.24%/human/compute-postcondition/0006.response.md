The code snippet appends a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the existing list `ops`. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)` still holds. The only change is that `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]` at the end.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that includes the operations `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it.**
