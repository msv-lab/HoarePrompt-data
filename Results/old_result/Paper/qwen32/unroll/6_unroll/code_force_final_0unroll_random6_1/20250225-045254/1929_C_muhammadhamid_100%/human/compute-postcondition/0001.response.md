To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code within the loop. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are read.
3. The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
4. An inner loop runs `x` times, updating `s` using the formula: `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
5. After the inner loop, the code checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The output state will consist of the results ('Yes' or 'No') for each of the `t` test cases. Since the output is printed directly within the loop and not stored in any variable, the only state we can describe after the loop finishes is the sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' outputs.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the output state can be described as a sequence of `t` results, each being either 'Yes' or 'No'. Since we don't have the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case, we can't determine the exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No'. However, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **a sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' for each of the t test cases.**
