Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers: `k` (where 2 <= k <= 30), `x` (where 1 <= x <= 100), and `a` (where 1 <= a <= 10^9). The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a specific output based on the given constraints.**
