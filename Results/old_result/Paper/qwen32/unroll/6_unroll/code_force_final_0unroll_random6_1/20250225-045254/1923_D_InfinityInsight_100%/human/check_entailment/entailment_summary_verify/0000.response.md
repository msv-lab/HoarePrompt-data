### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its function summaries to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- Slimes eat their neighbors if they are strictly bigger.
- Calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or determine if it is impossible.
- Output the results for each test case.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **`func_1(a, x)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the position where `x` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - It returns the position or -1 if `x` is less than 0.
   - **Issue**: This function seems to be used for finding positions in a prefix sum array, which is not directly related to simulating the slimes eating process.

2. **`func_2(a, n)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - It uses prefix sums (`left`) and keeps track of the last index where the slime size changes (`last`).
   - It iterates through the list of slime sizes and updates the `ans` array with the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - **Issue**: The logic in `func_2` seems to be attempting to use prefix sums and binary search to determine the minimum number of seconds, which does not align with the problem requirements. The problem requires simulating the process of slimes eating each other, not calculating prefix sums.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` states that it returns a list `ans` based on the sizes of the slimes and their relative positions through prefix sums and indices of changes in slime sizes. This summary does not match the problem requirements, which involve simulating the process of slimes eating each other.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:
```
Input:
4
4
3 2 4 2
3
1 2 3
5
2 2 3 1 1
7
4 2 3 6 1 1 8

Expected Output:
2 1 2 1
1 1 -1
2 1 -1 1 2
2 1 1 3 1 1 4
```

The provided code does not correctly simulate the process of slimes eating each other. For instance, in the first test case `[3, 2, 4, 2]`, the expected output is `2 1 2 1`, but the code does not produce this output due to its incorrect approach.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It uses an incorrect approach and does not handle the problem requirements properly. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
