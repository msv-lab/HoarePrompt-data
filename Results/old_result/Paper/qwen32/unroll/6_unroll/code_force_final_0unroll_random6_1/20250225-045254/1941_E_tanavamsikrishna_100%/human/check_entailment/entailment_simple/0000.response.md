### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`), the number of bridges (`k`), and the maximum distance between supports (`d`). It also reads the grid itself.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**: For each row in the grid, the program calculates the minimum cost to place supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`. This is done by the `func_1` function.

3. **Dynamic Cost Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes the first `d` elements of the row by adding 1 to the first element and 2 to the next `d-1` elements.
   - It then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to place supports up to the current position, ensuring the distance constraint is met.
   - For each subsequent element in the row, it calculates the cost by adding the smallest cost from the heap (which represents the cost of placing a support within the allowed distance) plus the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - The function returns the cost of placing supports in the last column of the row.

4. **Summing Costs for Consecutive Rows**: The program calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs calculated by `func_1` for each row in the set.

5. **Finding the Minimum Cost**: Finally, the program finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and prints it.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Initialization**: The first `d` elements are correctly initialized to account for the starting cost of placing supports.
- **Heap Usage**: The min-heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports within the allowed distance `d`. This ensures that the distance constraint is respected.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost for each cell is calculated correctly by adding the smallest cost from the heap plus the current cell's depth plus 1.
- **Summing Costs**: The program correctly sums the costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
- **Finding Minimum**: The program correctly finds and prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and computes the minimum cost for placing supports with the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
