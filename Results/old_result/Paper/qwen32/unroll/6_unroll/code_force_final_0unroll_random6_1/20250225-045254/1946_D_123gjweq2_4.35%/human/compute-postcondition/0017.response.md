Functionality: **The function `find_max` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `bit`, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= bit < 30. The function returns the length of the list `cur_arr` if `bit` is 0. If `bit` is greater than 0, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`, where `new_arr` is presumably derived from `cur_arr` based on some criteria involving `bit`. Alternatively, if certain conditions are met, it returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` directly.**
