### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by calculating the bets for each outcome such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).

2. **Calculate the Product of Multipliers (`m`)**: It calculates the product of all the multipliers (`m`). This product represents the total amount of coins that would be returned if the outcome with the smallest multiplier wins, assuming that the bets are distributed in a way that each bet is a fraction of `m` divided by the respective multiplier.

3. **Calculate Bets (`c`)**: For each outcome `i`, it calculates the bet as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that for each outcome, the return (`k[i] * c[i]`) is exactly `m`.

4. **Find the GCD of Bets (`hcf`)**: It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the bets. This step is to normalize the bets to the smallest possible integers while preserving the ratio.

5. **Normalize Bets**: Each bet is divided by the GCD, ensuring that the bets are integers and minimized.

6. **Check Feasibility**: It checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. If the sum of the bets is not less than this value, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution of bets is possible. Otherwise, it prints the normalized bets.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of Bet Calculation**: The bets are calculated such that for each outcome `i`, the return is `k[i] * c[i] = m`, which is the same for all outcomes. This ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the return for any winning outcome is the same (`m`).

- **Normalization**: By dividing each bet by the GCD of all bets, the program ensures that the bets are minimized and are integers.

- **Feasibility Check**: The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If this condition is not met, it correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Output**: If a valid distribution is found, the program outputs the bets. If not, it outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
