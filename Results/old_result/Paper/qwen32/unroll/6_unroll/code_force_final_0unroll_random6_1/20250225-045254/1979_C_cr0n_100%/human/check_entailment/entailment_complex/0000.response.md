### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute a set of bets (x_i) on n outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each possible winning outcome. The return for a winning outcome i is given by k_i * x_i, where k_i is the multiplier for that outcome.

The given code attempts to solve this problem using the following approach:

1. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (N) and the list of multipliers (vals).
2. **Calculating Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers. This is done using the `func_1` function which computes the LCM of two numbers.
3. **Generating Bets**: It then generates a list of bets (vprod) where each bet is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier. This ensures that the total bet (sum of vprod) is less than the return for each outcome.
4. **Adjusting Total Bet**: It adjusts the total bet by subtracting the sum of vprod from the LCM. If the adjusted total bet (den) is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution of bets is possible. Otherwise, it prints the bets.

### Analysis:

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the total bet can be evenly distributed in a way that respects the multipliers.
- **Generating Bets**: By setting each bet to the LCM divided by the multiplier, the code ensures that the return for each outcome is strictly greater than the total bet.
- **Adjusting Total Bet**: The adjustment step is unnecessary and seems to be a mistake. The sum of vprod should already be less than the LCM, and subtracting it from the LCM should not be needed. The condition `if (den <= 0)` is checking if the adjusted total bet is valid, but given the way vprod is constructed, this condition should never be true unless the input is invalid (which is not the case here).

### Conclusion:

Despite the unnecessary adjustment step, the core logic of the code is correct. It correctly generates a set of bets that satisfy the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program works as intended.
