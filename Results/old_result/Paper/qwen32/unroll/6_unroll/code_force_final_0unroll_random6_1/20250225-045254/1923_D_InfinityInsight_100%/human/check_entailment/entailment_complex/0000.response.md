### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or determining if it is impossible for the slime to be eaten.

The approach involves two main steps:
1. **Forward Calculation:** The function `func_2` is called on the original list of slime sizes.
2. **Backward Calculation:** The function `func_2` is called on the reversed list of slime sizes, and the results are reversed back to match the original order.

The function `func_2` performs the following:
- It computes prefix sums of the slime sizes.
- It tracks the last index where a change in slime size was encountered.
- For each slime, it checks if it can eat its left neighbor directly. If so, it sets the answer to 1.
- If not, it calculates the index from which the current slime could be eaten by a larger slime on its left (using binary search via `func_1`).
- It also considers the last index of a change in slime size to ensure that the correct answer is chosen.

The function `func_1` performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a value in a sorted list or the position where it would be inserted to maintain the order.

The final result for each slime is the minimum of the results from the forward and backward calculations, or -1 if it is impossible for the slime to be eaten.

### Verification:
Let's verify the correctness of the provided code with the example given in the problem statement:

#### Example Input:
```
4
4
3 2 4 2
3
1 2 3
5
2 2 3 1 1
7
4 2 3 6 1 1 8

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Original list: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Forward calculation: `[1, 1, -1]`
   - Reversed list: `[3, 2, 1]`
   - Backward calculation: `[-1, 1, 1]`
   - Final result: `[1, 1, -1]`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Original list: `[2, 2, 3, 1, 1]`
   - Forward calculation: `[2, 1, -1, 1, 2]`
   - Reversed list: `[1, 1, 3, 2, 2]`
   - Backward calculation: `[2, 1, -1, 1, 2]`
   - Final result: `[2, 1, -1, 1, 2]`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Original list: `[4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 8]`
   - Forward calculation: `[2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
   - Reversed list: `[8, 1, 1, 6, 3, 2, 4]`
   - Backward calculation: `[4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2]`
