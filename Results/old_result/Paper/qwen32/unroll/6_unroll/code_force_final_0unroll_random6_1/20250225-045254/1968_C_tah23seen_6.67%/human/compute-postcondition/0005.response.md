Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, for each `i` from `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest number greater than `arr[i]` that is a multiple of `ans[i-1]` plus `arr[i-1]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**

This means the list `ans` is constructed based on the rules provided, with the first element being one more than the first element of `arr`, subsequent elements being calculated as specified, and the last element being the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.
