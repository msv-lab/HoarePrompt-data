Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the first element of `arr` before the last sequence of that element.**
