The code snippet creates a list `vis` of length `n` where each element is initialized to 0. The other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `mx`, `cur`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element in `p` is a distinct integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive); `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha; `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of turns; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
