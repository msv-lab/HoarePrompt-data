The code snippet provided reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. The initial state mentions that these variables already have specific meanings and values, but the code reassigns them based on the input. The variable `rows` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, and `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid with the first and last elements being 0 and the rest being non-negative integers.**
