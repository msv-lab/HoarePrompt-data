Correctness: **False**

The given program contains an indentation error and a logical mistake. The `if ac > bc` block should be inside the loop for each test case, so that it prints the result for each test case separately. As it is now, the program will only print the result for the last test case after processing all of them.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

func()
```

This corrected version will print the most frequent letter for each test case as required by the problem description.
