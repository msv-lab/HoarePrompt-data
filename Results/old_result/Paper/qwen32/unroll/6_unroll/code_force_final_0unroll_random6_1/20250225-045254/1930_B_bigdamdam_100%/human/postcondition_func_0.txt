The function reads multiple integers `n` from the input, each representing the length of a permutation `p`. For each `n`, it constructs a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n` where even indices are filled in descending order starting from `n` and odd indices are filled in ascending order starting from 1 or 2 depending on the parity of `n`. The function then prints each constructed permutation.
