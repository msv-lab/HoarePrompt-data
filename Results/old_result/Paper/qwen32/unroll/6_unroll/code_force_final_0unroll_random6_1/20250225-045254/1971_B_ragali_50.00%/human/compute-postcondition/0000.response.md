Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the input provided, but the constraints on `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) remain valid. The variable `s` and its constraints are still valid as they were not affected by the code snippet.
