The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of `n` integers where the first `n-1` elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, and the last element is chosen such that the sum of all elements in `ans` equals `k`. The function prints this list for each test case.
