To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to carefully analyze how the loop modifies the state variables based on the input list `arr`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop processes the input:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `arr`: List of integers.
   - `new_segment`: An empty list.
   - `max_segment`: `[0, 0]`.
   - `segments_variants`: An empty list.
   - `max_sum`: `-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using the index `i`.
   - If `new_segment` is not empty:
     - If the current element `arr[i]` is negative:
       - Compare `max_segment[0]` with `new_segment[0]`.
       - If `max_segment[0]` is greater, append `max_segment + [i - 1]` to `segments_variants`.
       - Otherwise, append `new_segment + [i - 1]` to `segments_variants` and update `max_segment` to `new_segment`.
       - Reset `new_segment` to an empty list.
       - Add `arr[i]` to `max_segment[0]`.
     - If the current element `arr[i]` is non-negative:
       - Add `arr[i]` to both `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]`.
   - If `new_segment` is empty:
     - If the current element `arr[i]` is non-negative:
       - Initialize `new_segment` to `[arr[i], i]`.
     - Add `arr[i]` to `max_segment[0]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop, `new_segment` will be empty if the last element in `arr` was negative, or it will contain the last non-negative segment.
   - `max_segment` will contain the maximum sum segment found so far along with its end index.
   - `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that were considered as `max_segment` during the loop.
   - `max_sum` remains unchanged as `-1` since it is not modified within the loop.

Given the loop logic, let's consider an example to illustrate the final state. Suppose `arr = [1, 2, -1, 3, 4, -2, 5]`:

- Iteration 1: `arr[0] = 1` → `new_segment = [1, 0]`, `max_segment = [1, 0]`.
- Iteration 2: `arr[1] = 2` → `new_segment = [3, 0]`, `max_segment = [3, 0]`.
- Iteration 3: `arr[2] = -1` → `segments_variants = [[3, 1]]`, `max_segment = [3, 1]`, reset `new_segment`.
- Iteration 4: `arr[3] = 3` → `new_segment = [3, 3]`, `max_segment = [2, 1]`.
- Iteration 5: `arr[4] = 4` → `new_segment = [7, 3]`, `max_segment = [6, 1]`.
- Iteration 6: `arr[5] = -2` → `segments_variants = [[3, 1], [7, 4]]`, `max_segment = [7, 4]`, reset `new_segment`.
- Iteration 7: `arr[6] = 5` → `new_segment = [5, 6]`, `max_segment = [5, 4]`.

Final Output State:
- `new_segment`: `[5, 6]` (since the last element is non-negative and not followed by a negative element).
- `max_segment`: `[7, 4]` (the maximum sum segment found during the loop).
- `segments_variants`: `[[3, 1], [7, 4]]` (all segments considered as `max_segment`).
- `max_sum`: `-1` (unchanged).

Output State: **arr is a list of integers; new_segment is [5, 6]; max_segment is [7, 4]; segments_variants is [[3, 1], [7, 4]]; max_sum is -1.**
