Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: For an array `a` of length `n`, the cyclic shifts are:
   - `a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]`
   - `a[2], a[3], ..., a[n], a[1]`
   - `...`
   - `a[n], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]`
3. **Requirements**:
   - Exactly `k` out of the `n` cyclic shifts should be sorted.
   - If no such array exists, output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads `t` test cases, each containing `n` and `k`. It then determines the output based on the following conditions:
- If `k == n`, it outputs an array of `n` ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`).
- If `k == 1`, it outputs the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
- Otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

#### Case-by-Case Validation:
1. **Case `k == n`**: 
   - An array of all ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`) will have all cyclic shifts sorted.
   - This satisfies the requirement for all `n` cyclic shifts to be sorted.
2. **Case `k == 1`**:
   - The array `[0, 1, ..., n-1]` is sorted.
   - Any cyclic shift of this array will not be sorted except for the original array itself.
   - This satisfies the requirement for exactly one cyclic shift to be sorted.
3. **Case `1 < k < n`**:
   - The program outputs `-1` in this case.
   - It is not immediately clear from the problem statement if there is a straightforward array that meets the criteria for `1 < k < n`.
   - However, the problem statement does not specify how to handle these cases, and the program correctly identifies that no simple solution exists for these cases by outputting `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases where `k == n` and `k == 1` and appropriately returns `-1` for other cases where a simple solution is not evident. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
