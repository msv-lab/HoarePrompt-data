Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers and their relationships. It then outputs either a list of derived values or -1, depending on a specific condition involving the sum of these derived values relative to the LCM.**
