### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Players take turns placing rooks: you place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
   - Rooks cannot attack each other, i.e., no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - After `k` moves, the game continues until no valid moves remain.
   - The task is to determine the number of different final configurations, given `n` and `k`.

2. **Game Dynamics:**
   - You start first.
   - For each move you make at `(r, c)`, the computer mirrors your move at `(c, r)`.
   - If `r == c`, the computer skips its turn.
   - The game continues until no valid moves are left.

3. **Counting Configurations:**
   - The number of valid configurations depends on the remaining available positions on the board after `k` moves.
   - Each move (yours and the computer's) reduces the number of available positions.
   - The function `func_1` seems to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

4. **Analysis of the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the size of the board) and `k` (the number of moves already made).
   - For each of the `k` moves, it reads `(r_i, c_i)`.
   - If `r_i != c_i`, it reduces `n` by 2 (since both `(r_i, c_i)` and `(c_i, r_i)` are occupied).
   - If `r_i == c_i`, it reduces `n` by 1 (since only `(r_i, c_i)` is occupied).
   - After processing the `k` moves, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of configurations.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining `n` positions.
   - It uses dynamic programming to compute the result based on a specific recursive formula.
   - The formula is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` with initial values `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`.
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Verification:**
   - The provided code and function seem to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.
   - The reduction of `n` based on the moves is accurate.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` appears to correctly compute the number of configurations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided reasoning and analysis, the code seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
