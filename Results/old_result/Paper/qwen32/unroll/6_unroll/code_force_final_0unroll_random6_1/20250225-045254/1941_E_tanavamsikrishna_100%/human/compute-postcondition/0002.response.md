The code snippet creates a list called `costs` by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the 2D list `rows`, with `d` as a second argument. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` remain unchanged, but a new list `costs` is generated.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row of `n` space-separated integers read from the input, `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.**
