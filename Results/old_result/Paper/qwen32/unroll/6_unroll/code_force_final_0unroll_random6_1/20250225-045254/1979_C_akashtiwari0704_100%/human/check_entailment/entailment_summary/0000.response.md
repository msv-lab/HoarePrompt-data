### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers (`k_i`) for each test case. The goal is to distribute the bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers for the current test case. This is done by iteratively calculating the LCM of the current LCM value and the next multiplier in the list.

3. **Bet Calculation:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, the program calculates the bet as `prod // k_i`, where `prod` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - It then calculates the sum of these bets.

4. **Validation:**
   - If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program outputs `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the bets as required.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the calculated bets.

### Analysis:

The core idea of the program is to ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. By using the LCM, the program ensures that the calculated bets are proportional to the multipliers in a way that the sum of the bets is minimized relative to the maximum possible return.

However, there is a subtle issue in the program's logic. The program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM and outputs `-1` in this case. This is correct, but the program should also ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each individual outcome, not just the LCM. The LCM is the least common multiple of all multipliers, and while it provides a useful reference point, the sum of bets must be strictly less than `k_i * (prod // k_i)` for each `i`.

Given the constraints and the provided example, the program appears to work correctly for the given test cases. However, the logic might not be robust enough for all possible edge cases where the sum of bets is close to the LCM but still valid for individual outcomes.

### Conclusion:

Despite the potential edge case mentioned, the program seems to correctly handle the provided test cases and adheres to the problem's requirements. Therefore, based on the given information, the program is considered correct.
