### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem description.

#### Problem Description:
The problem requires us to find a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

A template `t` consists of letters that can be either lowercase or uppercase. The conditions for matching are:
- If the `i-th` letter of the template is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
- If the `i-th` letter of the template is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
`func_1` checks if there exists at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', implying that we can construct a template where `a[i]` and `b[i]` match (by choosing an uppercase letter in the template) and `c[i]` does not match (by ensuring it's different from the lowercase version of the template letter).

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
`func_2` is the main function that reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then uses `func_1` to determine if a valid template exists and stores the result. Finally, it prints all the results.

#### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct because if there is at least one position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can construct a template where `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template (by using an uppercase letter in the template) and `c[i]` does not match (by ensuring it's different from the lowercase version of the template letter).
- `func_2` correctly handles the input/output requirements and uses `func_1` to process each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
