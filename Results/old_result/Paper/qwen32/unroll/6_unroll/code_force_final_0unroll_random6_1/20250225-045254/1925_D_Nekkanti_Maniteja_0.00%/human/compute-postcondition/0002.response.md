Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here, `n` is the number of nodes, `m` is the number of edges, and `k` is another integer. It also receives `m` lines of input, each containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` with a feature value `f_i`. The function returns a value (or values) based on the input data for each test case.**
