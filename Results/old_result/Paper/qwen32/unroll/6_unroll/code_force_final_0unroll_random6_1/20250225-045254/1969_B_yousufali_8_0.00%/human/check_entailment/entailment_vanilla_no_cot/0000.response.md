Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The issue lies in how the function `func_1` processes the input and calculates the minimum cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

Here is a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` assumes the input is a space-separated list of integers, which is not how the problem specifies the input. The input is a binary string (no spaces), and it needs to be read as such.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic to calculate the cost is incorrect. The program increments `n` for each '1' encountered and adds `n + 1` to `ans` whenever a '0' is encountered after at least one '1'. This does not correctly represent the cost of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.

3. **Cyclic Shift Cost**: The cost of performing a cyclic shift on a substring is the length of that substring. The program does not account for this correctly, especially when multiple shifts might be needed to sort the string.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    ones = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            ones += 1
        elif ones > 0:
            cost += ones
    
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This corrected program reads the binary string correctly, counts the number of '1's encountered, and calculates the cost based on the number of '1's that need to be shifted past each '0'. This approach ensures that the minimum cost to sort the string is calculated accurately.
