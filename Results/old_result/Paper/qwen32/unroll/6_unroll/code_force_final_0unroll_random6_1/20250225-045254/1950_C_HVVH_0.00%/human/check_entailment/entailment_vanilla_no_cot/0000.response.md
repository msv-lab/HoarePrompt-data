Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a small mistake in the handling of the hour 12. Specifically, the line `day = 'AM'` inside the `else` block is incorrect because it incorrectly sets the day to 'AM' when `h` is 12. This should only happen when `h` is 0. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

In the corrected version, the day is correctly set to 'PM' when `h` is 12, and to 'AM' when `h` is 0.
