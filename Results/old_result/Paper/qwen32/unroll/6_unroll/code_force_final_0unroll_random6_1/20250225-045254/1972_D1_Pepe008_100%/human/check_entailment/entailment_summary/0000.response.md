### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided code seems to have a different logic and does not directly implement the described problem. The code calculates a sum based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) and adjusts it based on certain conditions. It also subtracts 2 from the final sum for each test case.

The logic in the code does not align with the problem requirements, as it does not compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating through all possible pairs and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

Given the execution summary, it appears that the code is doing something else entirely and is not solving the intended problem. Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**False**
