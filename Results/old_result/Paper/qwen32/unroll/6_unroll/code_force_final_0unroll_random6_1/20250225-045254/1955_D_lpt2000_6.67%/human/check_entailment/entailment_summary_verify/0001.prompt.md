You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates how many times a certain condition (the number of common elements between a sliding window of size `m` in list `a` and list `b` is at least `k`) is met and prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the approach taken by the code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

### Approach Analysis
The code follows a sliding window technique to efficiently count the number of good subarrays:
1. **Initialization**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It initializes a `Counter` for the first `m` elements of `a` (denoted as `cnt_aa`) and for `b` (denoted as `cnt_bb`).

2. **Initial Matching Calculation**:
   - It calculates the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` (denoted as `D`), which contains elements common to both `a` and `b` within the first `m` elements.
   - It calculates the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` (denoted as `E`), which contains elements in `a` but not in `b`.
   - It calculates the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` (denoted as `C`), which contains elements in `b` but not in `a`.
   - It counts the total number of matching elements in the initial window (denoted as `tot`).

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - It slides the window from the second position to the end of `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`in_aa`) and each element removed from the window (`out_aa`), it updates `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
   - It recalculates the total number of matching elements (`tot`) and checks if it is at least `k`.
   - It increments the count of good subarrays (`fnd`) if `tot` is at least `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the count of good subarrays.

### Correctness Verification
- **Initialization and Matching Calculation**: The code correctly initializes the counters and calculates the initial number of matching elements.
- **Sliding Window**: The logic for updating the counters and recalculating the number of matching elements when the window slides is correct. It properly handles the addition and removal of elements from the window.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or `m` (i.e., all elements must match or none must match).

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subarrays for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
