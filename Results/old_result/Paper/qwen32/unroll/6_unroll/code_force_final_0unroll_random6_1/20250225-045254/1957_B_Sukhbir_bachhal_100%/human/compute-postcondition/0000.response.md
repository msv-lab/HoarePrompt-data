Postcondition: **The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. However, the function definition provided only includes `n` as a parameter. The correct function definition should include both `n` and `k`. Additionally, the function will be called multiple times (up to `t` times, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`), each with its own pair of `n` and `k` values. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases will not exceed `2 * 10^5`. The current value of `n` is 0.**
