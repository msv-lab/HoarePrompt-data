### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, where the chessboard's size is `n x n` and `k` moves have already been played. The program then needs to compute the number of valid configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard, `n`, and the number of moves already played, `k`. For each of the `k` moves, it checks whether the move is mirrored or not and adjusts `n` accordingly:
- If the move is not on the diagonal (`a != b`), it means both the player's and the computer's moves occupy two unique positions, reducing `n` by 2.
- If the move is on the diagonal (`a == b`), it means only the player's move occupies a unique position, reducing `n` by 1.

After adjusting `n` based on the `k` moves, the program calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining `n x n` board.

The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations:
- It initializes a list `dp` with the first two values as 1.
- It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` list based on the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.
- The list `dp` is maintained to hold only the last two computed values to save memory.
- Finally, it returns the last computed value in `dp`, which represents the number of configurations for an `n x n` board.

The provided program seems to correctly implement the described logic. However, there are a few points to consider:
1. The modulo operation in the dynamic programming formula is correct.
2. The dynamic programming formula itself seems to correctly compute the number of configurations based on the problem statement.
3. The logic for adjusting `n` based on the moves is correct.

The only potential issue is the assumption that the dynamic programming formula correctly computes the number of configurations for the remaining board. Given the problem constraints and the provided example, it appears that the formula is correct.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
