Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **N**: This is an integer value input by the user.
2. **vals**: This is a list of integers.
3. **den**: This is calculated as the product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`. However, the exact calculation of `den` is not directly relevant to the print statement.
4. **vprod**: This is a list where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. The calculation of `vprod` depends on the value of `den`.
5. **Condition**: The value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply prints the integer `-1`. The value of `-1` is explicitly given in the code and does not depend on the values of `N`, `vals`, `den`, or `vprod`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs `-1`, the output will be:

Output: **-1**
