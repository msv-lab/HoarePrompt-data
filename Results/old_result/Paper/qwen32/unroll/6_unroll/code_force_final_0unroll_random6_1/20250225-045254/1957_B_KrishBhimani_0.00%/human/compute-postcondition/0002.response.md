To understand the output state, let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the input consists of two integers `n` and `k`.
3. The binary representation of `k` is determined. The positions of the set bits (1s) in the binary representation are stored in the list `arr`.
4. The list `ans` is constructed based on the positions of these set bits. The first `n-1` elements of `ans` are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions in `arr`. If there are fewer than `n-1` set bits, the remaining elements are filled with zeros.
5. The last element of `ans` is calculated such that the sum of all elements in `ans` equals `k`.
6. The list `ans` is then printed with `n` elements.

Given the above steps, the output state after all test cases are processed will be a series of lists `ans` for each test case, each list having `n` elements.

Output State: **For each test case, a list `ans` of `n` integers where the first `n-1` elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, and the last element is chosen such that the sum of all elements in `ans` equals `k`. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` from the initial conditions remain unchanged except that they have been processed.**
