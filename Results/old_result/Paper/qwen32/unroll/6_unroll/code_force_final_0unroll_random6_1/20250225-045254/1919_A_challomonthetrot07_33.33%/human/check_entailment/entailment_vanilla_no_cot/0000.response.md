Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy. Let's analyze the game mechanics and the correct logic to determine the winner.

### Game Analysis
The game revolves around the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key points to consider are:
1. **Swapping Wallets:** Players can choose to swap wallets or not.
2. **Removing Coins:** Players must remove one coin from their current wallet in each turn.
3. **Winning Condition:** The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

### Optimal Strategy
The optimal strategy involves analyzing the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of coins in both wallets:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by maintaining even parity in both wallets after each of her turns. Bob will eventually be forced to face a situation where both wallets are empty.
- If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Alice can swap wallets and make `b` odd and `a` even. Bob will then face the same situation as above.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Alice can swap wallets to make `a` even and `b` odd, putting Bob in a losing position.
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can maintain even parity in her wallet and force Bob into a losing position.

### Correct Logic
Based on the above analysis, the correct logic to determine the winner is:
- If `a` and `b` are both even, Alice wins.
- If `a` and `b` are both odd, Alice wins.
- If one of `a` or `b` is even and the other is odd, Bob wins.

### Correct Implementation
Here is the corrected implementation of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0) or (a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1):
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy described. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
