Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the substrings "pie" or "map" overlap or are nested within each other. The current implementation only checks for these substrings in non-overlapping segments of three characters at a time, which can lead to incorrect results when the substrings overlap.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
1
7
piepiep
```

The string "piepiep" contains two overlapping occurrences of the substring "pie". The provided program will only detect the first "pie" and skip the second one, resulting in an incorrect answer.

The correct approach would be to use a more sophisticated method to find and remove the minimum number of characters required to eliminate all occurrences of "pie" and "map", such as dynamic programming or a sliding window technique that can handle overlapping substrings.

Here's a counterexample that shows the failure of the current implementation:

**Input:**
```
1
7
piepiep
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

The program fails to recognize the second "pie" in the string, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
