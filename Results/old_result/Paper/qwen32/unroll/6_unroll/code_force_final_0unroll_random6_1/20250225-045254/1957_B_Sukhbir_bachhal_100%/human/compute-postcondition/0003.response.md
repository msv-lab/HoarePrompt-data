The code snippet provided initializes a variable `position` to 0. This does not affect the initial state of the function parameters `n` and `k`, nor does it impact the number of times the function `func_1` will be called (`t`). The only change is the introduction of the `position` variable set to 0.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. The function will be called multiple times (up to `t` times, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`), each with its own pair of `n` and `k` values. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases will not exceed `2 * 10^5`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0. `position` is 0.**
