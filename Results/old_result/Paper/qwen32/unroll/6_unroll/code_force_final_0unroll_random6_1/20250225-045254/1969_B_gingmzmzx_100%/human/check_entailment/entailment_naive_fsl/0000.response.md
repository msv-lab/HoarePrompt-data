Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations. The logic in the function `func_1` seems to be attempting to count the number of inversions in the string, but it does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts.

Let's analyze the code with an example:

Consider the input string `101011`. The correct minimum cost to sort this string is `5`, as described in the problem statement. However, the provided code will not produce this result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's logic for the input `101011`:

1. Initialize `zeroes` to the count of `0`s in the string, which is `3`.
2. Initialize `cnt` to `[0, 0]` to keep track of the count of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far.
3. Initialize `ans` to `0` to accumulate the cost.

Now, iterate through the string:

- For the first character `1`:
  - Increment `cnt[1]` to `1`.
  - Since the character is `1`, add `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`. Here, `zeroes` is `3` and `cnt[0]` is `0`, so `ans` becomes `3`.
  
- For the second character `0`:
  - Increment `cnt[0]` to `1`.
  - Since the character is `0`, add `1` to `ans` if `cnt[1] > 0`. Here, `cnt[1]` is `1`, so `ans` becomes `4`.
  
- For the third character `1`:
  - Increment `cnt[1]` to `2`.
  - Since the character is `1`, add `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`. Here, `zeroes` is `3` and `cnt[0]` is `1`, so `ans` becomes `6`.
  
- For the fourth character `0`:
  - Increment `cnt[0]` to `2`.
  - Since the character is `0`, add `1` to `ans` if `cnt[1] > 0`. Here, `cnt[1]` is `2`, so `ans` becomes `7`.
  
- For the fifth character `1`:
  - Increment `cnt[1]` to `3`.
  - Since the character is `1`, add `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`. Here, `zeroes` is `3` and `cnt[0]` is `2`, so `ans` becomes `8`.
  
- For the sixth character `1`:
  - Increment `cnt[1]` to `4`.
  - Since the character is `1`, add `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`. Here, `zeroes` is `3` and `cnt[0]` is `2`, so `ans` becomes `11`.

The final value of `ans` is `11`, which is not the correct minimum cost of `5`.

The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for cyclic shifts to sort the string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
