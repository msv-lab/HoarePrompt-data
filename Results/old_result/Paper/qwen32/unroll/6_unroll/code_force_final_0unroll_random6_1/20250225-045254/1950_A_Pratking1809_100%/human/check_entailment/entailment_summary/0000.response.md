Reasoning:  
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three digits and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement. If the digits satisfy the condition `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR". If the digits satisfy the condition `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK". Otherwise, it prints "NONE". The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
