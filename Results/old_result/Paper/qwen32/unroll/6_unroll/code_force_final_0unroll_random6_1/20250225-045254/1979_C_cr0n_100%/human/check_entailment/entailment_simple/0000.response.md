### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of distributing bets across different outcomes in a game such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The program uses a mathematical approach involving the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the bets.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.

2. **Calculating LCM:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `k_i`. This is done using the `func_1` function, which computes the LCM of two numbers by dividing their product by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - The LCM of all the multipliers is stored in the variable `den`.

3. **Determining Bets:**
   - The program calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by each multiplier `k_i`. These bets are stored in the list `vprod`.
   - The program then adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of the bets in `vprod`. This adjusted `den` represents the remaining amount that could be distributed to ensure the total bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the adjusted `den` is less than or equal to zero, the program outputs `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the bets as required.
   - If the adjusted `den` is positive, the program outputs the bets stored in `vprod`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM of the multipliers is calculated correctly using the `func_1` function.
  - The LCM ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a common multiple of all the multipliers, which is necessary for the program to work correctly.

- **Correctness of Bet Calculation:**
  - The bets are calculated by dividing the LCM by each multiplier, ensuring that the total bet is a common multiple of all the multipliers.
  - The adjusted `den` is used to check if it's possible to distribute the bets such that the total bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - If the adjusted `den` is less than or equal to zero, the program correctly outputs `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the bets as required.
  - If the adjusted `den` is positive, the program outputs the bets stored in `vprod`, which are valid bets that satisfy the problem's conditions.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the bets using the LCM of the multipliers and checks if it's possible to distribute the bets as required. The program outputs the correct results based on the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
