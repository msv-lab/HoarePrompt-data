Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to Alice's array `c`, with Bob simply removing elements from `a`. The objective is to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` for Alice and minimize it for Bob, assuming both play optimally.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. To maximize the MEX, Alice should aim to include as many consecutive integers starting from 0 in `c` as possible. Since Bob's moves do not contribute to `c`, he can be seen as hindering Alice's goal by removing elements.

### Optimal Strategy

1. **Alice's Goal**: Include as many integers from 0 to n-1 in `c` as possible.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Prevent Alice from including integers in `c` by removing them.

The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick the smallest available integer that is not yet in `c` and that has an odd count in `a` (since she can pick it and Bob cannot counter it by picking the same number). If all numbers have even counts, Alice can only pick numbers that Bob also picks, and the MEX will be the smallest number not included in `c`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1 and checks the following:

1. If a number `i` is not in the `Counter` (i.e., it does not appear in `a`), it prints `i` as the MEX.
2. If a number `i` appears exactly once in `a` and it is the first such number, it prints `i` as the MEX.
3. If a number `i` appears exactly once in `a` and it is not the first such number, it prints `i` as the MEX.

This logic does not correctly determine the MEX when considering the optimal play by both Alice and Bob. Specifically:
- The program does not account for the fact that Alice can only effectively use numbers with odd counts.
- It does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, which is necessary to determine the final state of `c`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX of `c` when both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
