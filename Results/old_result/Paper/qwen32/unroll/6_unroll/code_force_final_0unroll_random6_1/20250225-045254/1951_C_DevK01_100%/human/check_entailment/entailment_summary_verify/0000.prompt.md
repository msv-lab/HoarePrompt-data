You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
        print(cost)
        continue



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and prints the minimum cost required to purchase a specified total number of tickets (`k`) over a given number of days (`n`), with a daily limit on the number of tickets that can be bought (`m`). The cost is determined based on the prices of tickets for each day, provided in a list. The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by its own set of `n`, `m`, `k`, and ticket prices.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints. The issue lies in the greedy approach taken by the program, which does not always yield the optimal solution.

Let's break down the problem and the program:

### Problem Breakdown:
- **n**: Number of days tickets are available.
- **m**: Maximum tickets that can be bought per day.
- **k**: Total tickets to be bought.
- **a_i**: Price of a ticket on day i.

### Program Logic:
The program sorts the list of ticket prices and then tries to buy tickets in a greedy manner. It calculates the number of days needed to buy the tickets and then computes the cost based on the sorted prices.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Greedy Approach**: The program assumes that buying tickets on the cheapest days first is optimal. However, this is not always true because buying tickets on a day increases the price for subsequent days.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic does not correctly account for the price increases due to previous purchases.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 4
2 3 1 4
```
**Expected Output:**
```
10
```
**Explanation:**
- Buy 2 tickets on day 3 for a cost of 2 * 1 = 2. Prices become [4, 5, 3, 6].
- Buy 2 tickets on day 1 for a cost of 2 * 4 = 8. Prices become [6, 7, 5, 8].
- Total cost = 2 + 8 = 10.

**Program Output:**
```
12
```
**Explanation:**
- The program might buy 2 tickets on day 3 for a cost of 2 * 1 = 2. Prices become [4, 5, 3, 6].
- Then it might buy 2 tickets on day 2 for a cost of 2 * 5 = 10. Prices become [6, 7, 5, 8].
- Total cost = 2 + 10 = 12.

This shows that the program does not always find the minimum cost because it does not consider the optimal days to buy tickets considering the price increases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correctness is False.
