You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives multiple test cases. For each test case, it is given an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) is provided at the start.

        ans = 0

                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: `ans_f` is a list containing the results of each test case, where each result is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs formed from the input list for that test case.

        print(i)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program against the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0 for each test case.
   - It reads the integers into a list `lst` by splitting the input string.

3. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program aims to calculate the maximum score by always choosing pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
   - However, there are issues in the loop:
     - The loop iterates `n * 2` times, which is not necessary. Since we are removing pairs, we only need to iterate `n` times.
     - The removal of elements from the list is incorrect. The program attempts to remove elements at indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`, which are always `0` and `2` respectively, leading to incorrect behavior.
     - The `if len(lst) != 2` condition is unnecessary and incorrectly implemented.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the scores for each test case.

### Correct Implementation:
To achieve the correct result, the program should:
- Sort the list of integers.
- Pair the smallest integers together to maximize the sum of the minimums.
- Iterate `n` times, adding the minimum of each pair to the score.

### Correctness of the Given Program:
The current implementation does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum score. The removal of elements from the list is incorrect, and the loop logic is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Correct Implementation Example:
Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for j in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[j]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

This implementation sorts the list and pairs the smallest elements together, ensuring the maximum score is achieved.
