Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error in Checking for Beautiful Array**: The program only checks if all elements are the same by iterating through the array once. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False`. However, this is not the correct way to determine if an array is beautiful based on the problem's definition. The array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. The provided program does not perform this check.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**: The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of elements to remove by finding the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. This is not the correct approach to determine the minimum removals to make the array stop being beautiful. The program should try to identify the smallest segment that, when removed, will break the beauty condition of the array.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by checking the `flag`. However, the logic used to calculate the minimum removals is flawed.

The correct approach should involve identifying the longest segments of the array that can be made uniform by the operation described and then determining the smallest segment to remove to break this uniformity. The provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
