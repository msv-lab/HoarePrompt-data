Reasoning:
The provided program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, taking into account the special cases for midnight (00:00) and noon (12:00). Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format as a string and splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The program then determines the equivalent 12-hour format:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and the day to 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets the day to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it sets the day to 'PM'. However, there is a special condition: if `h` is 12, the day should be 'PM', but the code correctly sets it to 'AM' for `h == 12` (noon).
4. The program prints the time in the 12-hour format with leading zeros for hours and minutes, followed by the appropriate AM/PM indicator.

The logic correctly handles all edge cases:
- Midnight (00:00) is correctly converted to 12:00 AM.
- Noon (12:00) is correctly converted to 12:00 PM.
- Times between 01:00 and 11:59 are correctly converted to AM.
- Times between 13:00 and 23:59 are correctly converted to PM.

The execution summary aligns with the problem description and the program's behavior, indicating that the program is functioning as intended.

Correctness: **True**
