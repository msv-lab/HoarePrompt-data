Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to an array `c` (with Alice starting first). The game ends when `a` is empty. The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` when both players play optimally.

- **Alice's Objective**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
- **Bob's Objective**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.

### Key Observations
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will try to add as many small integers as possible to `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to block Alice from adding small integers to `c` to minimize the MEX.

### Strategy
- The optimal strategy can be derived from the observation that Alice can always add the smallest missing integer to `c` if it is available, and Bob can block her by removing that integer if it appears more than once.
- If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, Alice can add it to `c` and Bob cannot block her. This is because Bob can only remove one instance of `i` per turn.
- If an integer `i` appears more than once, Bob can remove one instance of `i` to block Alice from adding it to `c`.
- The game's final MEX is the smallest integer `i` that is either not present in `a` at all or appears exactly once and is added to `c` by Alice.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above strategy:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
```

1. **Counting Elements**: The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
2. **Iterating Over Possible MEX Values**: It iterates over integers from `0` to `n-1` to determine the smallest integer that meets the criteria for being the MEX.
3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not present in `a`, so `i` is the MEX.
   - If `i` appears exactly once in `a` and `first` is `True`, it means `i` is the first integer that appears exactly once, so `i` is the MEX.
   - If `i` appears exactly once, `first` is set to `True` to indicate that we have encountered the first integer that appears exactly once.

### Issues in the Program
- The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the first integer appearing exactly once after any integer not present in `a` is the MEX. This is not necessarily true.
- The `first` flag is not used correctly. It should be used to track if any integer has been added to `c` by Alice, but the program uses it incorrectly to determine the MEX.

### Correctness
The provided program does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal strategy described above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
