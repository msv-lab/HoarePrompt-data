To determine the output state after the loop has executed, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over the `costs` list, taking sums of `k` consecutive elements, and appends these sums to the `total_costs` list.

Here's the breakdown:
1. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(costs) - k`.
2. For each iteration, it calculates the sum of `k` consecutive elements starting from index `i` in the `costs` list.
3. This sum is then appended to the `total_costs` list.

Given the initial state, we have:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` as integers.
- `rows` as a 2D list of integers.
- `costs` as a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.
- `total_costs` as an initially empty list.

After the loop, `total_costs` will contain the sums of every possible `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row of `n` space-separated integers read from the input, `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every possible `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.**
