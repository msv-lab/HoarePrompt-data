### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if it correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Inputs**:
   - Number of children \( n \).
   - Number of pairs of friends \( m \).
   - Number of excursions \( k \).
   - Initial friendship values for each pair of friends.

2. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - Return the result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It then reads the details of each friendship pair and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculation of Constants**:
   - \( M = 10^9 + 7 \) (correct).
   - \( c \) is intended to be the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends into variable `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value using a loop that iterates \( k \) times, adding values to `s`. The formula used inside the loop seems incorrect and does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( c \)**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of \( n \times (n-1) \) instead of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is a critical error because \( c \) should be the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, not the product \( n \times (n-1) \).

2. **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used inside the loop to calculate `s` does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not derived from the correct probabilistic model for this problem.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Correct Calculation of \( c \)**:
  - \( c \) should be the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This can be computed using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem.

- **Correct Expected Value Calculation**:
  - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting each pair and the cumulative effect of increased friendship values over \( k \) excursions.

Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect calculation of \( c \) and the incorrect expected value formula, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
