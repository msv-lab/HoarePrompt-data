Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to build `k` consecutive bridges on a river grid, where each bridge must have supports at the start and end of the row, and supports between them must be no more than `d` cells apart.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`

This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row with the given constraints. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `row[0]` is set to 1, indicating the cost of placing a support at the start of the row.
   - For the next `d-1` cells, the cost is incremented by 2, likely to ensure a higher cost for placing additional supports initially.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is created to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports within the last `d+1` positions.
   - The heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each cell from `d` to the end of the row, the function pops elements from the heap that are out of the range of the last `d+1` positions.
   - The cost at each position is updated based on the minimum cost from the heap plus the current cell's cost plus 1.
   - The updated cost is then pushed back into the heap.

The critical part of the function is the `while` loop that pops elements from the heap if they are out of the range of the last `d+1` positions. This ensures that the heap only contains relevant costs for the current window of `d+1` positions.

#### Function `func_2()`

This function processes each test case:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the river grid.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
   - It calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`

- The initialization and heap usage seem correct. The heap ensures that only the relevant costs for the last `d+1` positions are considered.
- The `while` loop that pops elements from the heap if they are out of the range of the last `d+1` positions is crucial for maintaining the correct heap state. This loop ensures that the heap only contains the minimum costs for the current window, which is necessary for the correct calculation of the cost.

#### Function `func_2()`

- The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
- It correctly calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
- It prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly identified the `while` loop in `func_1` as unnecessary and potentially leading to incorrect behavior. However, this loop is essential for maintaining the correct heap state and ensuring that the cost calculation is accurate.

Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

**Final: True**
