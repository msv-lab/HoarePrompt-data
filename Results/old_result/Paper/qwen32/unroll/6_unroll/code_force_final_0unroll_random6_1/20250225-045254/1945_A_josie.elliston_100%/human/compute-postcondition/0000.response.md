To determine the Output State, we need to consider the impact of the function call `ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)`. This line of code calls a function named `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and assigns the return value to the variable `ret`. The values of `introverts` remain unchanged as they are not mentioned in the function call.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact value that `ret` will hold. However, we can state that `ret` will hold whatever value is returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.

Output State: **introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively; `ret` holds the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.
