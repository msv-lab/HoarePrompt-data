Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`:** The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row. However, it incorrectly calculates the cost and does not consider the constraint that the distance between supports should not exceed `d`. Specifically:
   - The initialization of the first few elements of the row is incorrect.
   - The logic for maintaining a heap to find the minimum cost is flawed. The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` will not correctly filter out elements that are too far apart.
   - The way the heap is updated and the cost is calculated does not ensure that the constraints are respected.

2. **Simplification Needed:** The problem can be solved using dynamic programming or a sliding window approach to efficiently find the minimum cost for placing supports in each row, considering the constraints. The provided code does not use such an approach.

3. **Edge Cases:** The provided code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `d` is very small or when all rows are identical.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:
- Use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row while respecting the distance constraint `d`.
- Then, use a sliding window technique to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

Given these issues, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.
