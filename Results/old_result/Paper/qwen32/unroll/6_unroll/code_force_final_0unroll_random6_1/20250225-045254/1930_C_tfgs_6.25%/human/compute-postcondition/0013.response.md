To determine the output, let's break down the given information and understand the state of the variables before the `print` statement is executed.

### Given Information:
- `t`, `n`, `a`, `counter`, and `cnt` are unchanged.
- `ans` contains all elements from `a` plus `cnt` additional elements, each being one less than the previous element.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: This is a list of integers. Since it is unchanged, its value remains the same as it was initially.
2. **Variable `cnt`**: This is the number of additional elements to be added to `ans`.
3. **Variable `ans`**: This list is constructed by taking all elements from `a` and then adding `cnt` additional elements. Each of these additional elements is one less than the previous element.

### Construction of `ans`:
- Start with the list `a`.
- Add `cnt` additional elements:
  - The first additional element is `a[-1] - 1` (one less than the last element of `a`).
  - The second additional element is `a[-1] - 2` (one less than the previous additional element).
  - Continue this pattern until `cnt` additional elements are added.

### Example to Illustrate:
Let's say `a = [3, 5, 7]` and `cnt = 3`.

- Initial `ans` is `[3, 5, 7]`.
- Add `cnt` additional elements:
  - First additional element: `7 - 1 = 6`
  - Second additional element: `7 - 2 = 5`
  - Third additional element: `7 - 3 = 4`

So, `ans` becomes `[3, 5, 7, 6, 5, 4]`.

### General Case:
- If `a` has `m` elements, the first `m` elements of `ans` are the same as `a`.
- The next `cnt` elements of `ans` are generated by subtracting `1, 2, 3, ..., cnt` from the last element of `a`.

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **all elements of `a` followed by `cnt` additional elements, each being one less than the previous element (where the additional elements start from `a[-1] - 1` and decrement by 1 for each subsequent element)**
