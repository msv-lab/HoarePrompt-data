Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input values.
- `idx` is calculated as `1 + 2 * t`.
- `results` is a list of `t` strings representing the results of each test case.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation:
- `results` is a list of `t` strings. Each string represents the result of a test case.
- The `'\n'.join(results)` method concatenates all the strings in the `results` list into a single string, with each original string separated by a newline character (`\n`).

### Output:
Since `results` is a list of `t` strings, the output will be these `t` strings printed one per line.

### Final Output:
Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the strings in the results list)**

This means that the `print` statement will output each string in the `results` list, separated by newline characters.
