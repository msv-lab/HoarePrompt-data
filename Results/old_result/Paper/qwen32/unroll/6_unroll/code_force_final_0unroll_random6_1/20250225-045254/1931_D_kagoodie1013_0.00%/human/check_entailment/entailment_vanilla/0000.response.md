Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to count the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` of length `n`. A pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if:
1. `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one. For each test case, it initializes two dictionaries: `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. These dictionaries are used to keep track of the remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize `count` to zero and two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`.
2. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element `num` in the array:
     - Calculate `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
     - Increment `count` by the sum of the values in `mod_x_map` for `mod_x` and `mod_y_map` for `mod_y`.
     - Update `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the remainder of `num` when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
3. **Appending Results**: After processing all elements in the array, append the `count` to the `results` list.
4. **Output**: Finally, print the results for all test cases.

### Issues in the Program
The main issue in the program lies in the calculation of `mod_x`. The program uses `mod_x = -num % x`, which is not the correct approach to determine the remainder for the condition `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x`.

#### Correct Calculation
To correctly determine the remainder for `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x`, we should calculate `mod_x` as `num % x` and look for pairs `(a[i] % x, a[j] % x)` such that `(a[i] % x + a[j] % x) % x == 0`. This means we should be looking for pairs of remainders `(r1, r2)` such that `(r1 + r2) % x == 0`.

### Correct Approach
Instead of using `mod_x = -num % x`, we should use `mod_x = num % x` and check for pairs of remainders `(r1, r2)` such that `(r1 + r2) % x == 0`. We also need to correctly update the dictionaries and count the pairs accordingly.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `mod_x`.

Correctness: **False**
