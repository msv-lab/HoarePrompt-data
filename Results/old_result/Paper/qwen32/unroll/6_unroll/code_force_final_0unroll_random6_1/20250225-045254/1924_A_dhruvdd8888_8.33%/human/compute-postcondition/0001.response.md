The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the newly input string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
