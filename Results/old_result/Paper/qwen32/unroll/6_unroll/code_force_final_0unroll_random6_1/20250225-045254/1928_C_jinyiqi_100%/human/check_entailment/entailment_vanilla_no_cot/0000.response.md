Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is referenced but not defined in the provided code snippet. This will cause a `NameError` when the program tries to execute it.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `k` Values**: The logic for calculating the possible values of `k` is incorrect. The program uses the function `func_1` to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but the way it derives `k` from these divisors is flawed. Specifically, the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` does not correctly determine the valid `k` values based on the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling of `k` Values**: The problem requires `k > 1` and the sequence to repeat every `2k - 2` positions. The program does not correctly handle these constraints.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

- For each test case, iterate over possible values of `k` starting from 2 up to a reasonable limit (since `k` should be less than or equal to `n`).
- For each `k`, calculate the position in the repeating sequence and check if it matches the given `x`.
- Count the number of valid `k` values that satisfy the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

This program correctly calculates the number of valid `k` values for each test case by iterating through possible `k` values and checking the conditions specified in the problem.
