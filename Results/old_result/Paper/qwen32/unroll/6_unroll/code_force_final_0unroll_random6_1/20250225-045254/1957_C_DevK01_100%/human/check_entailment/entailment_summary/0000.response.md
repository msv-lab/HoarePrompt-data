Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine the correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game on an n x n chessboard where players place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. Players alternate turns, with the computer mirroring moves unless the move is on the diagonal. The task is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after k moves have already been made.

### Key Points
1. **Moves and Mirroring**: Each move by the player places a white rook, and the computer places a black rook at the mirrored position unless the move is on the diagonal (r = c), in which case the computer skips its turn.
2. **Valid Moves**: Moves must not place rooks in the same row or column as existing rooks.
3. **Final Configurations**: The goal is to find the number of different final configurations after all possible moves have been made, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution involves:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases, the size of the board, and the number of moves already made.
2. **Processing Moves**: For each move, it checks if the move is on the diagonal (`r = c`). If not, it reduces the board size by 2 (since both the player's and the computer's moves occupy two positions). If the move is on the diagonal, it reduces the board size by 1.
3. **Calculating Configurations**: After processing all moves, the function `func_1` is called with the remaining board size `n`. This function calculates the number of different final configurations using a dynamic programming approach.

### Dynamic Programming Function (`func_1`)

The function `func_1` calculates the number of configurations using the following recurrence relation:
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \]
with base cases:
\[ dp[0] = 1 \]
\[ dp[1] = 1 \]

The recurrence relation is derived from the fact that for a board of size `n`, the number of configurations can be built upon the configurations of smaller boards, considering the placement of the next rook.

### Execution Summary

The execution summary indicates that `func_1` computes the value based on the provided recursive formula, which seems to correctly model the problem of counting configurations.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly processes the moves and uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of final configurations, which aligns with the problem requirements. The dynamic programming formula appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
