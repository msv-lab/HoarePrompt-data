### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of operations required to move chips into a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. The program's approach is as follows:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of integers representing the cells, where `0` indicates a free cell and `1` indicates a cell with a chip.

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program removes all leading and trailing `0`s from the list `a`. This step ensures that the count of operations (which is the count of `0`s between the first and last `1`s) is accurate.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - After trimming, the program counts the number of `0`s in the modified list `a`. This count represents the number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the count of `0`s remaining in the list after trimming, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations required.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:** This step is necessary because the problem specifies that we need to consider the minimum number of operations to move chips into a single block, and any leading or trailing free cells do not contribute to the operations needed.
  
- **Counting Operations:** The count of `0`s between the first and last `1`s in the trimmed list directly corresponds to the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. It accurately handles the input constraints and provides the correct output for each test case as demonstrated in the example.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
