### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
Here's the given program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Variable Names**: The program uses `a` and `b` to read the input values for `n` and `m` respectively, which is confusing. However, the logic inside the loop uses `i` for `b` and `a` for `n`. This is not incorrect per se but can be confusing.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent conditions do not accurately check the required condition.
3. **Incorrect Output Adjustment**: The final output is adjusted by subtracting 2 (`suma - 2`), which does not logically follow from the given conditions.

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations describe the state of the program but do not validate the logic. The annotations state that the program processes multiple test cases and calculates a sum based on the given integers `n` and `m`. However, the annotations do not explain why the logic inside the loop is correct or incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true.

#### Correct Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the required condition, and the output adjustment by subtracting 2 is not logically justified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
