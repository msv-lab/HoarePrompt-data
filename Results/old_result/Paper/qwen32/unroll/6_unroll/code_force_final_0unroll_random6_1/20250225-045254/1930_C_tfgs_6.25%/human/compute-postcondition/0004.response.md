The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `a`. This `Counter` object, named `counter`, will hold the frequency of each element in the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the list `a` is modified such that each element `a_i` is the original `a_i` plus `i + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the original list `a` remain unchanged, but the new list `a` is used to populate the `counter`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the original `a_i` plus `i + 1`; `counter` is a Counter object that holds the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`.**
