### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:** The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x` because each 1x1 icon occupies one cell.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, because each 2x2 icon occupies four cells.

3. **Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `screen_require_for_y` is calculated to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `y` 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most two 2x2 icons (because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and a 5x3 screen has 15 cells), the calculation is:
     ```python
     if y % 2 == 0:
         screen_require_for_y = y // 2
     else:
         screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
     ```
   - This ensures that if `y` is odd, an extra screen is counted to accommodate the remaining 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells:**
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as the number of cells left in the screens allocated for 2x2 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. This is given by:
     ```python
     remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
     ```

5. **Placing 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` (the number of 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then all 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells of the screens allocated for 2x2 icons. The number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, then additional screens are required to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. The number of extra screens needed is calculated as:
     ```python
     if extra_space % 15 == 0:
         extra_screen = extra_space // 15
     else:
         extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
     ```
     Here, `extra_space` is the number of 1x1 icons that couldn't fit in the previously allocated screens, and `extra_screen` is the number of additional screens needed to place these icons.

6. **Result Compilation:**
   - The total number of screens required for each test case is appended to the `result` list, which is then printed after processing all test cases.

### Verification:

The logic correctly handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons across multiple screens. The calculations for the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining capacity for 1x1 icons are accurate. The program accounts for any leftover 1x1 icons that need additional screens, ensuring the minimal number of screens is used.
