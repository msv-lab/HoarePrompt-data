Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value of the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and the conditions related to them) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
