The code snippet provided initializes a new dictionary named `visited`. This does not affect the values of `start_pos`, `score`, `current_pos`, or `steps`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of the `visited` dictionary while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, where n is the length of the permutation p and the array a; `score` is 0; `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`; `steps` is 0; `visited` is an empty dictionary.**
