Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` that were appended during the loop, `xor` is 0, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1. Therefore, `thing1` is -1. Additionally, the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 1.**
