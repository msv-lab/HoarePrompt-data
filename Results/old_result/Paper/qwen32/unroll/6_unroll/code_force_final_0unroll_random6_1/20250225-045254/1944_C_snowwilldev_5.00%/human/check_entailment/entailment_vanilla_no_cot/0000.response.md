Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the final score of the game when both players play optimally. The logic in the program does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. 

Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be determined by simply counting the occurrences of each number and breaking when a number with a single occurrence is found or a number with zero occurrences is encountered.

To solve the problem correctly, one must consider the parity (odd or even) of the counts of each number and how Alice and Bob can strategically pick numbers to influence the MEX. A correct approach involves iterating through the numbers and determining the smallest index where the count of numbers up to that index is not sufficient to guarantee a higher MEX, considering the optimal play of both players.
