Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Program Analysis

Here is the provided program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        return print('YES')
    print('NO')
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Function Summary

The function `func_1`:
1. Reads the input values `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
2. Initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
3. Uses a set `win` to keep track of unique characters encountered in `s` that are in `us`.
4. Iterates through `s`, adding characters to `win` if they are in `us`.
5. If `win` reaches `k` unique characters, it adds the last character to `ans` and clears `win`.
6. If `ps` (the number of times `win` has reached `k` unique characters) is at least `n`, it prints 'YES'.
7. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Checking**:
   - The program does not correctly check for subsequences. It assumes that finding `k` unique characters consecutively forms a valid subsequence, which is incorrect. Subsequences do not need to be contiguous or unique in the sense that the program is using.

2. **Subsequence Construction**:
   - The construction of subsequences is flawed. The program does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked. Instead, it relies on finding `k` unique characters, which does not guarantee the existence of all subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - The logic for generating a string that is not a subsequence is incorrect. It does not ensure that the generated string is indeed not a subsequence of `s`.

### Counterexample

Consider the input:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
- The program incorrectly identifies `aa` as not being a subsequence of `abba`, which is not true. The string `abba` contains the subsequences `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`, so the correct output should be `YES`.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to accurately check for all possible subsequences of length `n` and incorrectly generates strings that are not subsequences.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
