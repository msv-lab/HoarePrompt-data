Functionality: **The function takes a list of integers called `number` and a non-negative integer called `quantity`. It returns a sublist of `number` containing the first `quantity` elements. If `quantity` is 0, it returns an empty list. If `quantity` is greater than the length of `number`, it returns the entire list `number`.**
