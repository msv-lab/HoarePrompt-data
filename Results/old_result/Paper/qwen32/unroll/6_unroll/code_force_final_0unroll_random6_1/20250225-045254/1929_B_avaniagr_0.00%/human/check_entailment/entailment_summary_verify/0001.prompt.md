You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells to color in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The grid has `4n - 2` diagonals in total.

- **Diagonals**: In an `n x n` grid, there are `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left, making a total of `4n - 2` diagonals.
- **Objective**: Color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

### Key Observations

1. **Minimum Coloring Requirement**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2n - 1`, you can cover `k` diagonals by coloring `k // 2 + k % 2` cells. This is because each cell can cover at most two diagonals (one from each direction), and you need to round up if `k` is odd.
   - If `k` is greater than `2n - 1` but less than `4n - 3`, you still need to cover `k` diagonals. The formula `(k // 2 + k % 2)` will generally give the correct number of cells, but it needs to be handled carefully for edge cases.
   - If `k` is equal to `4n - 3`, you need to cover all diagonals except one, which requires coloring `2n - 1` cells in a specific pattern.
   - If `k` is equal to `4n - 2`, you need to cover all diagonals, which requires coloring `2n` cells (one cell per diagonal).

2. **Special Cases**:
   - When `k == 4n - 2`, you need to color `2n` cells.
   - When `k == 4n - 3`, you need to color `2n - 1` cells.
   - When `k < 4n - 3`, you can use the formula `(k // 2 + k % 2)`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses the following logic:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

Let's break down the logic:

- `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This part calculates the number of cells needed if `k < 4n - 3` using the formula `(k // 2 + k % 2)`.
- `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part covers the case when `k` is `4n - 3` or `4n - 2` by setting the number of cells to `2n`.
- `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This part adds `1` if `k` is exactly `4n - 2`.

### Correctness Check

The logic in the program seems to handle the cases correctly:

- For `k < 4n - 3`, it uses `(k // 2 + k % 2)`, which is correct.
- For `k >= 4n - 3`, it uses `2 * n`, which is correct for `k == 4n - 3` and `k == 4n - 2` (since `(k == 4 * n - 2)` adds `1` to `2n - 1`).

However, there's a subtle issue: the expression `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)` will always be `2n` when `k >= 4n - 3`, and the additional `(k == 4 * n - 2)` will add `1` only when `k == 4n - 2`. This means the program will correctly output `2n` for `k == 4n - 2` and `2n - 1` for `k == 4n - 3`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
