The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and the list `test_cases` itself. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `test_cases`. If `test_cases` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple. The initial state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, and `test_cases` must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list**
