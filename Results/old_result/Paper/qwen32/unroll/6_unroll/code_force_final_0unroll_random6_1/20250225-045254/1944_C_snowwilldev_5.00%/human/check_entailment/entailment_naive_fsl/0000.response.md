Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or removing them from `a` (Bob).
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The program tries to determine the final score (MEX) of the game by counting the occurrences of each element in the array `a` and then determining the smallest integer that is not present in `c` based on the counts.

Here's the program again for reference:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Logic for Determining MEX**:
   - The program increments `t` whenever it encounters an element with a count of 1.
   - It breaks and prints `i` when `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`.
   - This approach does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob and does not correctly determine the MEX.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where all elements have counts greater than 1 or where the counts are distributed in a way that affects the MEX.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
The correct MEX should be `5` because all numbers from `0` to `4` are present in the array. However, the program will output `0` because `cnt[0] == 1` and `t` will be incremented, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
