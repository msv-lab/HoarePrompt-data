In the provided for loop, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use within the loop body. However, the loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables `n`, `k`, `a`, and `ans_list` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing. However, for the loop to make sense in the context of the problem, we should ensure that `t` is within the given range (1 <= t <= 100).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
