You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a single integer value that represents the minimum number of elements to remove from the list so that all remaining elements are the same.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation. The operation allows us to select a contiguous subarray and set all its elements to a specific value, incurring a cost equal to the length of the subarray. The goal is to determine the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - If the array has only one element or all elements are already the same, the cost is `0`.

3. **Reverse Copy:**
   - The program creates a reversed copy of the array `onum`.

4. **Counting Consecutive Elements:**
   - It counts the number of consecutive elements from the start (`cn`) and from the end (`ck`) that are the same.
   - If the elements at the start and end are the same, it adds `ck` to `cn`.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cost as `n - max(cn, ck)`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the entire array equal.

### Correctness Evaluation

- **Single Element or Uniform Array:**
  - The program correctly identifies these cases and outputs `0`.

- **General Case:**
  - The program attempts to find the longest sequence of equal elements starting from either the beginning or the end of the array.
  - It then calculates the cost based on the maximum of these two lengths.

However, the logic for handling the general case is flawed. The program does not consider all possible subarrays or the optimal subarray to change. The optimal subarray to change might not necessarily be the longest sequence of equal elements starting from the beginning or the end. For example:

- Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The optimal operation would be to change the subarray `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1`, which costs `4` burles. However, the program might incorrectly calculate the cost based on the longest sequence of equal elements starting from the beginning or the end, which would be `1` (either the first or the last element), leading to an incorrect cost of `5`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those where the optimal subarray to change is not the longest sequence of equal elements starting from the beginning or the end.
