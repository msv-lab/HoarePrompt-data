You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` made up of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it outputs 'No' if the second last character of the second string is '<', otherwise it outputs 'Yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and has two actions each second:
1. Move one cell in one of four possible directions (left, right, down, up).
2. Move according to the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on.

The goal is to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n).

### Key Observations
- The robot can only move right or left in the same row or move down or up between rows.
- The robot starts on the top row (row 1).
- The robot needs to reach the bottom row (row 2) at the last column (column n).

### Correctness Analysis of the Provided Program
The provided program checks only the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last cell of the bottom row (i.e., `b[n - 2]`). If this arrow points left (`<`), it prints "No", indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. Here's why:
- The robot needs to be able to navigate through the grid correctly, considering all the arrows in both rows.
- The program does not take into account the arrows in the top row (`a`) and how they influence the robot's movement.
- The program does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid to see if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

### Example Counter-Case
Consider the following test case:
```
2
4
>>><
>><<
```
The program would incorrectly output "No" for this test case because `b[2]` (third cell of the second row) is `<`. However, the robot can actually reach the target cell (2, 4) by following the path: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and does not consider all possible paths and arrows in the grid. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
