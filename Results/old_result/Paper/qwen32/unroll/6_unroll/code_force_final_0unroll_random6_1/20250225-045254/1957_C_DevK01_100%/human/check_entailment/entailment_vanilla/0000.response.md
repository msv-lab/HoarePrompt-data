### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an `n x n` chessboard after `k` initial moves, considering the rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer.

#### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves, each consisting of two integers representing the row and column where a rook was placed.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, if `a != b`, it decrements `n` by 2 because both the row and column are now occupied and cannot be used for future moves.
   - If `a == b`, it decrements `n` by 1 because only one position is occupied and cannot be used for future moves.
   - This logic correctly accounts for the reduction in available positions on the board after each move.

3. **Calculating Configurations:**
   - The code calls `func_1(n)` to calculate the number of different final configurations given the remaining `n` positions.
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations. The recurrence relation used in `func_1` seems to be based on the idea that for each new position, you can either place a rook or not, and the number of configurations grows based on the previous states.

4. **Dynamic Programming in `func_1`:**
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with the first two values as `1` (base cases).
   - For each new position `i`, the number of configurations is computed as `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - The recurrence relation seems to be derived from the fact that for each new position, you can either place a rook in a new row and column (which affects both `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`), or not place a rook at all (which only affects `dp[i-1]`).

5. **Output:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` returns the number of configurations for the remaining `n` positions, which is then printed for each test case.

### Evaluation:

The code seems to follow the correct logic and handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. However, there are a few points to consider:

- The dynamic programming relation used in `func_1` appears to be correct based on the problem's constraints and the nature of the game.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow, which is crucial given the large possible values of `n`.
- The logic for decrementing `n` based on the moves is also correct.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore:

**Correctness: True**
