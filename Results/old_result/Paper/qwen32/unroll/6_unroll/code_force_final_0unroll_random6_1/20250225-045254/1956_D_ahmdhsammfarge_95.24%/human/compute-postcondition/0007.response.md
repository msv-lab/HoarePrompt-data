Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that includes the operations `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it. `n` is `l - r + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is calculated as `l - r + 1`, and all other variables (`r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`) remain unchanged.
