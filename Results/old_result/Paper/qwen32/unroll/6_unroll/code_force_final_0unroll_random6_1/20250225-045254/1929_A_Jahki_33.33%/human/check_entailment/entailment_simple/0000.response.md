Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array in ascending order. Sorting is a key step because the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the numbers in increasing order. This is because the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array is maximized.

3. **Beauty Calculation**: The program calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

4. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, this function does not affect the correctness of the program in terms of calculating the maximum beauty, as the program always sorts the array regardless of the result of `func_1`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements. The function `func_1` is not necessary for the correctness of the program, but it does not affect the outcome either.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
