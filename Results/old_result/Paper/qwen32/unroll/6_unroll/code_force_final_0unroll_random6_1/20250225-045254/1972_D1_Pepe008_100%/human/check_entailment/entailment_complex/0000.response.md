To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it accurately computes the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions for each test case.

The conditions are:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The program attempts to solve this problem by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). However, the logic used in the program seems flawed and does not correctly implement the required conditions.

Let's break down the program's logic:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
```

The program does not correctly iterate over the range of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it calculates a value \(x\) based on some formula and adjusts the sum accordingly. This approach does not match the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given constraints and check whether the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This would involve a nested loop structure where we iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and count the valid pairs.

Given the complexity and the constraints, a direct approach might not be efficient enough. Instead, a more optimized approach would involve using mathematical properties and number theory to count the valid pairs efficiently.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the solution, the correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
