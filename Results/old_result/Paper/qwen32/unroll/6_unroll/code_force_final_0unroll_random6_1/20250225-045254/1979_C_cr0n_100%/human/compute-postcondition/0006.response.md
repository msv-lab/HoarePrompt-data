Output State: **`N` is the integer value input by the user, `vals` is a list of integers, `den` is the product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`, `vprod` is a list where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.**

Explanation: The value of `den` has been updated to be the original product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`. The values of `N`, `vals`, and `vprod` remain unchanged.
