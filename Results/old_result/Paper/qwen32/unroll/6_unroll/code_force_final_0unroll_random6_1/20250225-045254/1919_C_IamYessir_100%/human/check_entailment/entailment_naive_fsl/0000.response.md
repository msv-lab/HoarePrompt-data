Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The program attempts to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` and tries to minimize the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)`. However, the logic used to decide whether to add an element to `s` or `t` is flawed and does not guarantee the optimal split.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation of the expected output:
One optimal way to split the array is `s = [1, 2]` and `t = [3, 4]`. The penalties are `p(s) = 1` and `p(t) = 1`, so the total penalty is `2`.

Actual Output of the Program:
The program might output `1` for this input, which is incorrect.

Let's see how the program processes this input:
- The program initializes two empty lists `a` and `b`.
- It iterates through the input array `1 3 2 4` and decides to add elements to either `a` or `b` based on the conditions provided.

Let's trace the decisions:
1. `lit[0] = 1`: Since both `a` and `b` are empty, it can add `1` to either. Let's assume it adds `1` to `a`.
   - `a = [1]`, `b = []`
2. `lit[1] = 3`: Since `a[-1] = 1` and `b` is empty, it adds `3` to `a` because `1 < 3`.
   - `a = [1, 3]`, `b = []`
3. `lit[2] = 2`: Since `a[-1] = 3` and `b` is empty, it adds `2` to `b` because `2 < 3`.
   - `a = [1, 3]`, `b = [2]`
4. `lit[3] = 4`: Since `a[-1] = 3` and `b[-1] = 2`, it adds `4` to `a` because `3 < 4`.
   - `a = [1, 3, 4]`, `b = [2]`

The penalties are:
- `p(a) = 2` (since `1 < 3` and `3 < 4`)
- `p(b) = 0` (since `b` has only one element)

So, the total penalty is `2 + 0 = 2`, which is correct in this case. However, the program's logic does not guarantee this optimal split for all cases.

Let's consider another input where the program might fail:

Input:
```
1
4
4 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Explanation of the expected output:
One optimal way to split the array is `s = [4]` and `t = [3, 2, 1]` or `s = [4, 3, 2]` and `t = [1]`. The penalties are `p(s) = 0` and `p(t) = 0`, so the total penalty is `0`.

Actual Output of the Program:
The program might output `1` for this input, which is incorrect.

Let's see how the program processes this input:
- The program initializes two empty lists `a` and `b`.
- It iterates through the input array `4 3 2 1` and decides to add elements to either `a` or `b` based on the conditions provided.

Let's trace the decisions:
1. `lit[0] = 4`: Since both `a` and `b` are empty, it can add `4` to either. Let's assume it adds `4` to `a`.
   - `a = [4]`, `b = []`
2. `lit[1] = 3`: Since `a[-1] = 4` and `b` is empty, it adds `3` to `b` because `3 < 4`.
   - `a = [4]`, `b = [3]`
3. `lit[2] = 2`: Since `a[-1] = 4` and `b[-1] = 3`, it adds `2` to `b` because `2 < 3`.
   - `a = [4]`, `b = [3, 2]`
4. `lit[3] = 1`: Since `a[-1] = 4` and `b[-1] = 2`, it adds `1` to `b` because `1 < 2`.
   - `a = [4]`, `b = [3, 2, 1]`

The penalties are:
- `p(a) = 0` (since `a` has only one element)
- `p(b) = 0` (since `3 > 2` and `2 > 1`)

So, the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`, which is correct in this case. However, the program's logic does not guarantee this optimal split for all cases.

In general, the program's logic does not ensure that the subsequences `s` and `t` are split in a way that minimizes the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)`. The conditions used to decide whether to add an element to `s` or `t` are not optimal and can lead to suboptimal splits.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
