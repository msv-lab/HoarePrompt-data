Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed, with the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0. The list `ops` now includes the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

In simple terms, the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been added to the `ops` list, while all other conditions and values remain the same.
