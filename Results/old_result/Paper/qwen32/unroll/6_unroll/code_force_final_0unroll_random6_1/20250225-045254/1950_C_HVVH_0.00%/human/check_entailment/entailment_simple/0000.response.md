Let's analyze the program logic and compare it with the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. The program must convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. The program should handle the transition between AM and PM correctly.
3. Leading zeroes in the hour and minute should be preserved.

### Key Points of the Program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format.
3. It then converts the hour `h` to 12-hour format and determines whether it is AM or PM.
4. Finally, it prints the converted time in the required format.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Conversion Logic**:
  - If `h` is `0`, it sets `h` to `12` and `day` to `'AM'`.
  - If `h` is greater than `12`, it subtracts `12` from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`.
  - If `h` is `12`, it sets `day` to `'PM'`. However, there's a mistake in this part of the logic. If `h` is `12`, it should set `day` to `'PM'`, not `'AM'`.
  - If `h` is between `1` and `11`, it sets `day` to `'AM'`. This part is correct.
  
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles `00:00` and `12:00` as `12:00 AM` and `12:00 PM` respectively.
  - It should also correctly handle `12:00 PM` which is not correctly handled due to the incorrect logic for `h == 12`.

### Mistake in the Code:
- The code incorrectly sets `day` to `'AM'` when `h` is `12`. It should set `day` to `'PM'` when `h` is `12`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to the mistake in handling the `h == 12` case.

Correctness: **False**
