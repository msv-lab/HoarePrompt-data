t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: a tuple (n, f, k) and a list a. Here, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, f and k are integers such that 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n, and a is a list of integers such that len(a) = n and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for each a_i in a.
