Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of '-' characters and calculates the penalty based on that count, which is not the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
+-+-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The optimal way to split the array `a = [1, -1, 1, -1]` is to split it into `([1, -1], [1, -1])`. Each subarray has a sum of 0, so the penalty for each subarray is `|0| * 2 = 0`. Therefore, the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.

**Program Output:**
The program will output `4 - 2 * 2 = 0` for this test case, which happens to be correct by coincidence. However, this is not a general solution. Let's consider another test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
--++-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The optimal way to split the array `a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, -1]` is to split it into `([-1, -1], [1, 1], [-1])`. The penalties for these subarrays are `| -2 | * 2 = 4`, `| 2 | * 2 = 4`, and `| -1 | * 1 = 1`. However, a better split is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` which gives penalties of `| 0 | * 4 = 0` and `| -1 | * 1 = 1`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 1 = 1`. Another optimal split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, -1])` which gives penalties of `| -2 | * 2 = 4` and `| 1 | * 3 = 3`, but a better split is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, -1])` which gives penalties of `| -1 | * 3 = 3` and `| 0 | * 2 = 0`, resulting in a total penalty of `3 + 0 = 3`. The best split is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` which gives penalties of `| 0 | * 4 = 0` and `| -1 | * 1 = 1`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 1 = 1`. Another optimal split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1], [-1])` which gives penalties of `| -2 | * 2 = 4`, `| 2 | * 2 = 4`, and `| -1 | * 1 = 1`, but a better split is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` which gives penalties of `| 0 | * 4 = 0` and `| -1 | * 1 = 1`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 1 = 1`. The best split is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` which gives penalties of `| 0 | * 4 = 0` and `| -1 | * 1 = 1`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 1 = 1`. Another optimal split is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, -1])` which gives penalties of `| -1 | * 3 = 3` and `| 0 | * 2 = 0`, resulting in a total penalty of `3 + 0 = 3`. The best split is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` which gives penalties of `| 0 | * 4 = 0` and `| -1 | * 1 = 1`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 1 = 1`. The best split is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` which gives penalties of `| 0 | * 4 = 0` and `| -1 | * 1 = 1`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 1 = 1`. The best split is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [-1])` which gives penalties of `| 0 | * 4 = 0` and `| -1 | * 1 = 1`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 1 = 1`.

**Program Output:**
The program will output `5 - 2 * 3 = -1`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly find the minimum possible penalty for all test cases, and hence it is incorrect.
