### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by handling two specific cases:
1. When the number of coins Alice has (`n`) is equal to the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy (`k`).
2. When `n + 2 > k * 2`.

However, the provided logic does not cover all possible scenarios. Here are some key points:

1. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - The program correctly identifies this case and outputs "YES" with a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
   - The program outputs "YES" with two stalls: one priced at `n - k + 1` and the other at 1. This logic is flawed. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program would output prices `8` and `1`. Alice would buy 1 jewel from the first stall (leaving her with 2 coins) and 2 jewels from the second stall, totaling 3 jewels. However, this logic does not work for all values of `n` and `k`. For instance, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the program would output prices `7` and `1`. Alice would buy 1 jewel from the first stall (leaving her with 3 coins) and 3 jewels from the second stall, totaling 4 jewels. But this still does not generalize well.

3. **General Case**
   - The program does not handle cases where `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2 <= k * 2`. In these cases, it simply outputs "NO". However, it is possible to construct a solution using up to 60 stalls for a wide range of `n` and `k` values by carefully choosing the prices.

### Example of a Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we can use a greedy approach by setting prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One effective strategy is to use powers of 2 for the prices, which ensures that Alice can buy any number of jewels up to a certain limit. For example, using prices `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]` allows Alice to buy any number of jewels up to the sum of these prices.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif k > n:
            print('NO')
        else:
            prices = []
            remaining = k
            power = 0
            
            while remaining > 0:
                if remaining & 1:
                    prices.append(2 ** power)
                remaining >>= 1
                power += 1
            
            if sum(prices) <= n:
                print('YES')
                print(len(prices))
                print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when `n + 2 <= k * 2`. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
