You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #   - The state of the variables `t`, `n`, `num`, `f`, `onum`, `cn`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` will be based on the last iteration of the loop, but since the problem asks for the output state, we focus on the printed results.
    #
    #Since the output is a series of numbers printed for each test case, the output state can be described as a list of these results.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a single integer value that represents the minimum number of elements to remove from the list so that all remaining elements are the same.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. Let's analyze why the code is incorrect with a specific example.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal, we can choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 1`. This operation will change the array to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with a cost of `(4 - 2 + 1) = 3` burles.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will output `4` for this input.

**Reason for Incorrectness:**
The program checks if the array is already uniform or if it can be made uniform by extending the same number from the start or end. However, it does not consider more complex cases where the optimal solution involves changing a segment in the middle of the array. The logic in the program is too simplistic to handle such cases optimally.

The program only checks the longest uniform segment from the start and the longest uniform segment from the end and then calculates the cost based on these segments. This approach fails when the optimal solution involves changing a segment that is neither at the start nor the end of the array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible cases to find the minimum number of burles required.
