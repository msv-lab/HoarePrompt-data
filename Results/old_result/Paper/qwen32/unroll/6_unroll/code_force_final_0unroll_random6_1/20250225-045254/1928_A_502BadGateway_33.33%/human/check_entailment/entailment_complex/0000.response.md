### Reasoning:
To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting the original rectangle, we must consider the possible ways to cut and rearrange the pieces.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the side of length `b`, he gets two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)`. This is only possible if `b` is even.
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the side of length `a`, he gets two rectangles of size `(a/2) x b`. This is only possible if `a` is even.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle:**
   - After cutting, Bob can try to form a new rectangle using the two smaller rectangles. For example, if he cuts a `2x6` rectangle into two `2x3` rectangles, he can rearrange them to form a `3x4` rectangle.
   - If `a` or `b` is even, he can always form a new rectangle by cutting and rearranging. However, if both `a` and `b` are odd, he cannot form a new rectangle because the resulting pieces will be `1x(a/2)` or `(a/2)x1` (which is not possible since `a` is odd) or similarly for `b`.

Given the function `func_1(a, b)` which returns 'yes' if `b` is even, it only considers the case where the rectangle can be cut parallel to the side of length `b`. This is not sufficient to cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, it does not account for the possibility of cutting parallel to the side of length `a`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1(a, b)` is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, whereas the correct solution should check if either `a` or `b` is even.

### Correctness: **False**
