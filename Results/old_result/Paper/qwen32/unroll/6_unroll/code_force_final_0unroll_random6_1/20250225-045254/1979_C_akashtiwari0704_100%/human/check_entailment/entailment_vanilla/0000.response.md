Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires distributing bets on `n` outcomes such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. If such a distribution is not possible, the program should output `-1`. Otherwise, it should output a valid distribution of bets.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`. It then divides this LCM by each multiplier to determine the bets and checks if the total of these bets is less than the LCM.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i` are read.

2. **Calculating LCM:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers is calculated using a helper function `lcm`.

3. **Determining Bets:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, the bet is set to `LCM / k_i`.
   - The total bet amount `sumo` is calculated as the sum of these bets.

4. **Checking Validity:**
   - If the total bet amount `sumo` is less than the LCM, the bets are printed.
   - Otherwise, `-1` is printed.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic of using the LCM is flawed because it does not guarantee that the total bet amount will be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- The condition `sumo < prod` does not ensure that `sumo < prod / k_i` for all `i`. This is a critical requirement for the problem.
- The program does not guarantee that the solution meets the problem's requirements.

### Example:
For the test case:
```
3
3 2 7
```
The LCM of `3, 2, 7` is `42`. The bets calculated are `42/3 = 14`, `42/2 = 21`, and `42/7 = 6`. The total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is less than `42`. However, for the third outcome, the received amount is `7 * 6 = 42`, which is not strictly greater than `41`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

**Correctness: False**
