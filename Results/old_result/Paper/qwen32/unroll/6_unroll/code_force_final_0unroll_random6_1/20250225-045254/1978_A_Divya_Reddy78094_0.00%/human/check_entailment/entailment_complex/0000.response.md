### Reasoning:
The task is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. The given program correctly identifies the two largest numbers in the list of pages for each test case and outputs their sum. This is because the two largest numbers in the list represent the highest number of pages in each pile when the books are divided optimally.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.
3. **Sorting**: The list `nums` is sorted in descending order.
4. **Output**: The program then prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, which are the two largest numbers.

This approach ensures that the sum of the two largest numbers is always the maximum possible sum of the highest numbers in two non-empty piles, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Since the program correctly identifies and sums the two largest numbers in the list for each test case, it produces the correct output as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
