Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. The key points are:

1. A 5x3 screen has 15 cells.
2. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
3. Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
4. We need to minimize the number of screens used to fit all the icons.

### Solution Analysis:

Let's break down the solution provided:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `a` and the number of 2x2 icons `b`.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons by first calculating `t = b * 2`. This step seems incorrect because `b * 2` does not directly translate to the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. Instead, it should calculate the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons, which is `b * 4`.
   - The program then calculates the number of screens needed for these 2x2 icons by dividing by 15 (the total number of cells in a screen) and rounding up. This is done correctly with the logic `t = t // 5 + 1` if `t % 5 != 0`.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - If not, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`. It then calculates the number of additional screens required and adds this to the total number of screens `t`.

### Issues in the Solution:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The initial calculation `t = b * 2` is incorrect. It should be `t = b * 4` to represent the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - The subsequent logic to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is correct once the total cells are correctly calculated.

2. **Logic for Remaining Cells:**
   - The logic for calculating remaining cells and additional screens for 1x1 icons is correct once the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons are correctly calculated.

### Corrected Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        # Calculate total cells occupied by 2x2 icons
        cells_occupied_by_2x2 = b * 4
        # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = cells_occupied_by_2x2 // 15
        if cells_occupied_by_2x2 % 15 != 0:
            screens_for_2x2 += 1
        # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - cells_occupied_by_2x2
        # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_cells >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            additional_cells_needed = a - remaining_cells
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_cells_needed // 15
            if additional_cells_needed % 15 != 0:
                total_screens += 1
        print(total_screens)
```

### Conclusion:

The original solution contains a critical error in the calculation of the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
