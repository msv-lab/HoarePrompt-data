### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if there is a way to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k` are read.

2. **Calculating `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as the product of all the multipliers `k`.

3. **Calculating `c`:**
   - For each outcome `i`, `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`.

4. **Calculating HCF (GCD) of `c`:**
   - The `func_1` function calculates the GCD of all elements in the list `c`.

5. **Normalizing `c`:**
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the HCF to simplify the values.

6. **Checking the Condition:**
   - If the sum of the elements in `c` is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `c`, which represent the bets on the outcomes.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `m`:**
  - `m` is the product of all multipliers `k`. This is correct as it represents the least common multiple of the multipliers, ensuring that the bets can be distributed in a way that satisfies the conditions.

- **Correctness of `c`:**
  - `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that if the `i-th` outcome wins, the amount received back is `k[i] * c[i] = m`, which is greater than the total bet `sum(c)`.

- **Normalization:**
  - Dividing each `c[i]` by the HCF of all `c[i]` simplifies the values but does not affect the relative differences, ensuring that the condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` still holds if it was true before normalization.

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. If this condition is not met, it correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of bets is possible and outputs the correct bets or `-1` if no valid distribution exists.

**Correctness: True**
