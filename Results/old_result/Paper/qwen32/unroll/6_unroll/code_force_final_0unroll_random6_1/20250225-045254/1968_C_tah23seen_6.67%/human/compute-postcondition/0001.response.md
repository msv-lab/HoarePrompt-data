The code snippet assigns `ans[0]` the value of `arr[0] + 1`. The other elements of `ans` remain unchanged, and `arr` remains unchanged as well. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `arr[0] + 1`.**
