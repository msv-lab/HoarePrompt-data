The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which is iterated over from the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` are not directly related to the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `results` is a list with at least one element. The state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`results` is a list of results from each func_1 call that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the integer value read in the last iteration, `a` is the string read in the last iteration, `b` is the string read in the last iteration, `c` is the string read in the last iteration, `t` is the same as the initial value**
