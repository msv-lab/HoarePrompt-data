To determine the state that allows the `while t:` loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `t` is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy. Given the initial state, `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\). This means `t` is already within a range that makes it truthy.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be a non-zero integer within the specified range, no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute the first time. The loop condition `while t:` will naturally be satisfied with the given state.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**
