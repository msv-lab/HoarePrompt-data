    #State: The final value of `s` for each test case, which is the sum of the number of consecutive increasing elements in lists `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it divides the integers into two lists `a` and `b` based on specific conditions and then calculates the sum of the number of consecutive increasing elements in both lists. The result for each test case is printed.
