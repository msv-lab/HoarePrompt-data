Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of boxes `n`, the initial cat arrangement `s1`, and the desired cat arrangement `s2`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to adjust the cat arrangement in the boxes from `s1` to `s2`.**
