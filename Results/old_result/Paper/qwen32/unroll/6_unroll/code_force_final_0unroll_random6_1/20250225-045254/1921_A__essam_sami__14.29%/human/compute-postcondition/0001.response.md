In this task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `steps`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set correctly so that the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Given the problem statement, `t` is already constrained to be in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, so no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

2. **Adjustments to the state**: The only variable in the loop head is `steps`, which is the loop variable. Before the loop starts, `steps` is not explicitly defined, but it will be initialized by the `range(t)` function. Therefore, we don't need to adjust `steps` before the loop starts. It will take on the values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop iterations.

3. **Other variables**: The problem mentions that for each test case, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. However, these variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts only needs to ensure that `t` is within the specified range (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100). Since this condition is already provided, no further adjustment is necessary.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100**
