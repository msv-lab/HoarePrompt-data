Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and the array), `k` (a positive integer representing the duration of the game), `PB` (a positive integer representing Bodya's starting position), `PS` (a positive integer representing Sasha's starting position), `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the permutation), and `a` (a list of `n` integers representing the array). The function returns 'Bodya' if Bodya reaches the end of the array before Sasha within `k` moves, 'Sasha' if Sasha reaches the end of the array before Bodya within `k` moves, and 'Draw' if neither reaches the end within `k` moves or if they reach the end at the same time.**
