You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer b (either 1 or 2) and an integer x (1 <= x <= n for b=1, x >= 1 for b=2), and queries is a list of integers where each integer k satisfies 1 <= k <= len(array) after all operations are performed.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples, queries is a list of integers, array is the final modified list after all operations, result is an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: - After the loop finishes, `result` will contain elements from `array` at positions determined by the indices calculated from `queries`.
    #   - The state of `n`, `operations`, `queries`, and `array` remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #Given this understanding, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    return result
    #The program returns `result` which contains elements from `array` at positions determined by the indices calculated from `queries`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `b` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `x` (with constraints based on the value of `b`); and `queries`, which is a list of integers representing indices. The function performs a series of operations on an initially empty array and returns a list `result` containing elements from the array at positions specified by the `queries`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `result` which contains elements from `array` at positions determined by the indices calculated from `queries`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
