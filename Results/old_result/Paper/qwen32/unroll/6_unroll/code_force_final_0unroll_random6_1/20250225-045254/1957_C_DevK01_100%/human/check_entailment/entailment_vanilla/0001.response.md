Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - A player and a computer take turns placing rooks on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - The player places white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
   - Rooks cannot be placed in the same row or column as another rook.
   - After `k` moves, the game continues until no more valid moves can be made.
   - The computer mirrors the player's move `(r, c)` to `(c, r)`, unless `r == c`, in which case it skips its turn.

2. **Objective:**
   - Calculate the number of distinct final configurations of the chessboard after the game ends, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Constraints:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5`
   - `0 ≤ k ≤ n`
   - Sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.

### Program Analysis:

The given program consists of two main parts:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` are read.
   - For each of the `k` moves, the coordinates `(r, c)` are read.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(r, c)`, the program checks if `r == c`.
     - If `r != c`, it decrements `n` by 2 (since both rows and columns are occupied).
     - If `r == c`, it decrements `n` by 1 (since only one position is occupied).
   - After processing all moves, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of configurations.

3. **Computing Configurations (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations.
   - It initializes a list `dp` with two elements `[1, 1]`.
   - It iteratively computes the number of configurations for boards of increasing size up to `n`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Move Processing:**
   - The logic for decrementing `n` based on whether `r == c` is correct.
   - If `r != c`, both `r` and `c` are occupied, so `n` should be decremented by 2.
   - If `r == c`, only one position is occupied, so `n` should be decremented by 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming Recurrence:**
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations.
   - This relation is derived from considering the placement of rooks in a way that no two rooks attack each other, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 1` are correct, as there is only one way to place rooks on a 1x1 or 2x2 board without them attacking each other.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes the input, updates the board size based on the moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of distinct final configurations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
