Output State: **n is the integer value read in the last iteration, a is the string read in the last iteration, b is the string read in the last iteration, c is the string read in the last iteration, t is the same as the initial value, results is a list of results from each func_1 call.** 

The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. This does not change the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `t`. The `results` list remains unchanged as well, since printing does not modify the list. Therefore, the state of these variables remains the same as the initial state.
