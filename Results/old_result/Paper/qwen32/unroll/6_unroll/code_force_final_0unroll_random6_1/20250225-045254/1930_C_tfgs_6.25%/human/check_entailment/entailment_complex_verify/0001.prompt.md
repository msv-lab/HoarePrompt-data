You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

    2 1

    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

    #This is printed: all elements of `a` followed by `cnt` additional elements, each being one less than the previous element (where the additional elements start from `a[-1] - 1` and decrement by 1 for each subsequent element)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It modifies the list by adding the index plus one to each element, then constructs a new list `ans` that includes all unique elements from the modified list `a` in descending order, with additional elements inserted between consecutive elements of `a` based on specific conditions. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing the lexicographically largest array `b` from a set `S` where `S` is populated by the values `a_i + i` from the array `a`. The set `S` cannot contain duplicate values, and the array `b` is the sorted version of `S` in decreasing order.

Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Transformation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.
   - It then transforms each element `a_i` to `a_i + i + 1` and stores it back in `a`.

2. **Handling Duplicates and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each transformed value.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in decreasing order.

3. **Constructing the Result Array `b`:**
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the result.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique values of `a` (which are now in decreasing order).
   - For each unique value `a[i]`, it ensures that the previous value `a[i-1]` (if it exists) is added to `ans` the appropriate number of times to maintain the lexicographical order.
   - It then adds `a[i]` to `ans` and decrements its count in the `Counter`.
   - If there are still remaining counts (duplicates that were not added yet), it adds the last value in `ans` decremented by 1 until all counts are used up.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Transformation Step:** The transformation `a_i + i + 1` is correctly applied to each element of `a`.
- **Handling Duplicates:** The use of `Counter` and converting `a` to a set correctly handles duplicates.
- **Sorting:** Sorting the unique values in decreasing order ensures that the final array `b` will be in the correct order.
- **Constructing `b`:** The logic for constructing `b` ensures that the lexicographically largest array is formed by considering the counts of each unique value and maintaining the correct order.

The program correctly implements the required logic to generate the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
