### Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if the digits form a "STAIR" using the condition `a < b < c`.
   - It checks if the digits form a "PEAK" using the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it outputs "NONE".

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case based on the conditions evaluated.

The provided annotated program states correctly that `t` (which is `q` in the code) remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are re-assigned in each iteration. The output is correctly described as being 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the evaluated conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the input and output as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
