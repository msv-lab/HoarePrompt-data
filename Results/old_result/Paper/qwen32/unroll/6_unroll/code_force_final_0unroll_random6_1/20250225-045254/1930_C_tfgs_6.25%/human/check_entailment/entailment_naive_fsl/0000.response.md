Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not guarantee the lexicographically largest array `b` because it does not strategically choose the index `i` for each operation to maximize the values inserted into the set `S`.

Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
8 7 6 5
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To achieve the lexicographically largest `b`, we should aim to insert the largest possible values into `S` at each step. Here's how we can achieve this:
1. In the first operation, choose `i = 4` (index 3), insert `a[4] + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8` into `S`, and remove `a[4]` from `a`, resulting in `a = [1, 2, 3]`.
2. In the second operation, choose `i = 3` (index 2), insert `a[3] + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6` into `S`, and remove `a[3]` from `a`, resulting in `a = [1, 2]`.
3. In the third operation, choose `i = 2` (index 1), insert `a[2] + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4` into `S`, and remove `a[2]` from `a`, resulting in `a = [1]`.
4. In the fourth operation, choose `i = 1` (index 0), insert `a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` into `S`, and remove `a[1]` from `a`, resulting in `a = []`.

Thus, `S = {8, 6, 4, 2}` and `b = [8, 6, 4, 2]`.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
The provided program does not guarantee this optimal strategy. It simply adds `a[i] + i + 1` for each `i` in sequence and then sorts the set `S` in decreasing order. This does not ensure that the largest possible values are inserted first, leading to a potentially suboptimal `b`.

For instance, the provided program might result in a different sequence of insertions that does not yield the lexicographically largest `b`.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce the lexicographically largest `b` as required by the problem description.
