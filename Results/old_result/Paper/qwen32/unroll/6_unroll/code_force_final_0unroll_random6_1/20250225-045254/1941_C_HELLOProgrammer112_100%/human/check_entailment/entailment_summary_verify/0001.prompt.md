You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in `s`, excluding the occurrences where 'mapie' appears as a substring.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful, i.e., to remove all occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map". The program needs to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it:
1. Reads the length of the string `n` (which is not used in the program).
2. Reads the string `s`.
3. Counts the occurrences of "map" (`x`), "pie" (`y`), and "mapie" (`z`).
4. Prints `x + y - z`.

### Correctness Analysis

The approach in the program has a logical flaw. Here's why:

- The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and subtracts the occurrences of "mapie". However, this does not accurately determine the minimum number of deletions required.
- For example, consider the string "mapiepie". The program would count 2 "map", 2 "pie", and 1 "mapie", resulting in `2 + 2 - 1 = 3`. However, only 2 deletions are necessary to make the string beautiful (remove one 'm' and one 'p' to get "apiie" or "mapee", or another valid transformation).
- The program does not account for overlapping occurrences or other complex interactions between the substrings "map" and "pie".

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, a dynamic programming or greedy approach would be more appropriate. The program should consider the positions of "map" and "pie" and determine the minimum deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings without over-counting or under-counting deletions.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to accurately determine the minimum number of deletions required in several cases.
