Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10. The main issue is that the program only performs one split operation per pair of elements and does not continue checking the entire array after a split. This can lead to incorrect results when multiple splits are needed to sort the array.

Let's consider a specific example:

**Input:**
```
1
4
32 15 7 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Split 32 into 3 and 2: [3, 2, 15, 7, 9]
- Split 15 into 1 and 5: [3, 2, 1, 5, 7, 9]
- The array is now sorted: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]

However, the given program will not perform these splits correctly and will output "NO" for this input because it only checks adjacent elements and does not continue to check the entire array after a split.

The program also does not handle cases where multiple splits are required to sort the array. It should continue to check and split elements until no more splits are needed or the array is sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
