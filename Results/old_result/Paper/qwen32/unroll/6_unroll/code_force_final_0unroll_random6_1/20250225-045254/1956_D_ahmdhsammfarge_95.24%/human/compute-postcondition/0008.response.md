The code snippet modifies the list `lst` by replacing the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with `n` repeated `n` times, where `n` is `l - r + 1`.

Given the initial state, the elements in `lst` from index `r` to `l` are replaced by the list `[n, n, ..., n]` (with `n` elements). The values of `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers where elements from index `r` to `l` are all `n` (with `n` = `l - r + 1`), and ops is a list that includes the operations `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it.**
