You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the solution step by step to determine the correctness of the provided Python program.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from an array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just deleting them (Bob). The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, with both players playing optimally.

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

### Strategy

The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob can be deduced as follows:

- Alice should aim to add elements to `c` in such a way that the smallest missing number (MEX) is maximized.
- Bob should aim to prevent Alice from achieving this by removing elements strategically.

Since Alice goes first and both players play optimally, the key observation is that:

- If an element appears at least twice in `a`, it can be ignored by Bob, as he can always remove one occurrence, and Alice can never add it to `c`.
- Alice should try to add elements that appear only once to `c` to maximize the MEX.

### Solution Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by counting the frequency of each element in the array `a` and determining the MEX based on these frequencies.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Frequency Counting**:
   - `freq = [0] * (n + 1)`: Initializes a frequency array to count occurrences of each number up to `n`.
   - `for i in arr: freq[i] += 1`: Populates the frequency array.

2. **Determine MEX**:
   - `cou = 0`: Counter to track how many unique elements are added to `c`.
   - The loop iterates over possible values from `0` to `n`:
     - `if freq[i] >= 2: continue`: Skips elements that appear at least twice.
     - `if freq[i] == 1: cou += 1`: Increments the counter for unique elements.
     - `if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0: print(i); break`: Prints the current value of `i` when the second unique element is encountered or when a missing element is found.

### Correctness

The logic in the code is correct in the sense that it correctly identifies the MEX based on the frequency of elements. However, there is a subtle issue:

- The loop condition `if cou == 2` is incorrect. Alice can add more than two unique elements to `c` to maximize the MEX. The correct condition should be to find the first missing element, which is the smallest `i` such that `freq[i] == 0`.

### Corrected Code

The corrected code should look like this:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
```

### Conclusion

The provided code is incorrect due to the incorrect loop condition. The correct code should simply find the first missing element in the frequency array.

Correctness: **False**
