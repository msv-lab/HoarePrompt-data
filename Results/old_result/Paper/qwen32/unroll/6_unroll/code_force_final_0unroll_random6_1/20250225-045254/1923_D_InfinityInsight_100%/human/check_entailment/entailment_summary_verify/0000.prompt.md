You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes such that 1 <= n <= len(a). It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is determined based on the sizes of the slimes and their relative positions. The specific values in the returned list are calculated through a series of operations involving prefix sums and indices of changes in slime sizes.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The code seems to be attempting to solve a different problem or is incomplete. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements:

### Problem Requirements:
1. Slimes eat their neighbors if they are strictly bigger.
2. Calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or determine if it is impossible.
3. Output the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a brief overview of what these functions do:

1. **`func_1(a, x)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the position where `x` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - It returns the position or -1 if `x` is less than 0.

2. **`func_2(a, n)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - It uses prefix sums (`left`) and keeps track of the last index where the slime size changes (`last`).
   - It iterates through the list of slime sizes and updates the `ans` array with the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Approach**:
   - The code uses prefix sums and binary search, which is not the correct approach for solving the problem as described. The problem requires simulating the process of slimes eating each other, not calculating prefix sums.
   
2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly simulate the process of slimes eating each other. It incorrectly calculates the minimum number of seconds based on prefix sums and binary search, which does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where no slime can eat its neighbor. For example, in the case `[1, 2, 3]`, the third slime cannot eat any neighbor, and the code should output `1 1 -1`.

### Example where the Code Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
2 2 3 1 1
```
The expected output is:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```
However, the provided code will not produce this output. It will likely produce an incorrect result due to the incorrect approach and logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It uses an incorrect approach and does not handle the problem requirements properly. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
