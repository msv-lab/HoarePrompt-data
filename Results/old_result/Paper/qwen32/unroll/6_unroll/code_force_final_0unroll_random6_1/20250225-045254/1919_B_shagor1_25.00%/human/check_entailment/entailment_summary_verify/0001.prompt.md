You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Function Summary: 
For each test case, the function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates and prints a value based on the number of '-' characters in the string. Specifically, it prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg` (where `neg` is the count of '-' characters), otherwise it prints `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` in such a way that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

### Key Observations:
1. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - For a subarray `c` of length `m`, the penalty is `|sum(c)| * m`.
   - To minimize the penalty, we want to create subarrays where the sum is zero because `|sum(c)|` would be zero, resulting in zero penalty for that subarray.

2. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy is to create subarrays where the sum is zero whenever possible. If we cannot create a subarray with a sum of zero, we should try to minimize the absolute value of the sum.
   - For example, if `a` is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, the optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])` resulting in a penalty of `0`.
   - If `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` resulting in a penalty of `5`.

### Given Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input, counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s`, and then calculates the output based on this count.

The logic in the program is:
```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `neg` is the count of '-' characters in `s`.
- The output is calculated as `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`; otherwise, it is `n`.

### Verification:
- For the first test case (`s = "+"`):
  - `n = 1`, `neg = 0`, output = `1 - 2 * 0 = 1` (correct).
- For the second test case (`s = "-----"`):
  - `n = 5`, `neg = 5`, output = `5 - 2 * 5 = 5` (correct).
- For the third test case (`s = "+-+-+-"`):
  - `n = 6`, `neg = 3`, output = `6 - 2 * 3 = 0` (correct).
- For the fourth test case (`s = "--+++++++-"`):
  - `n = 10`, `neg = 2`, output = `10 - 2 * 2 = 6` (incorrect, should be `4`).
- For the fifth test case (`s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`):
  - `n = 20`, `neg = 8`, output = `20 - 2 * 8 = 4` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for cases where the optimal split does not simply involve alternating subarrays of `+` and `-` that sum to zero.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
