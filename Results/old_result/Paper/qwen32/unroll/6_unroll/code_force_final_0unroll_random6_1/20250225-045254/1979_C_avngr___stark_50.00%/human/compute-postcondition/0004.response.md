Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines. Each pair consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The function returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the initial value `t` and all the subsequent elements in `numbers`.**
