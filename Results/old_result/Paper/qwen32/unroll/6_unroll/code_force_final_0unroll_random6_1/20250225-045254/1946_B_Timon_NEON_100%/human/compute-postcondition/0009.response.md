The only object in the loop head is the variable `segment`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If the list has at least one segment, the loop will execute.

Before the loop starts, `segments_variants` is provided as a list of segments, and it must have at least one segment for the loop to execute. The state of `segment` is not specified before the loop starts, but it will be assigned the first element of `segments_variants` when the loop begins.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment.

State: **`new_segment` is [], `max_segment` is [max_sum_of_segment, end_index_of_segment], `segments_variants` is a list with at least one segment, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [-1]**
