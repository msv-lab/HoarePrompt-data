Let's analyze the code and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The third condition can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

### Code Analysis

Let's look at the provided code:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
func()
```

#### Key Points in the Code
1. The code iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. It initializes `suma` to 0.
4. It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
5. It calculates \(x\) based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
6. It checks if \(x\) is positive and increments `suma` by \(x\).
7. It checks additional conditions and increments `suma` by 1 if those conditions are met.
8. Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula and conditions used in the code do not align with the problem description.
2. **Incorrect Output**: The code subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not explained or justified by the problem statement.
3. **Variable Misuse**: The variables `a` and `b` are read from the input, but the loop iterates over `i` up to `b`, and `a` is used in a way that does not match the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

Based on the above analysis, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
