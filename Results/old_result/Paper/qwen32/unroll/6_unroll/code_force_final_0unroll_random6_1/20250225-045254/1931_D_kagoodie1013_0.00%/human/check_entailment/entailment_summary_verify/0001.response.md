### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to count the number of pairs `(i, j)` in an array `a` such that:
1. `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary provided states that the function processes each test case by maintaining dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to count remainders of array elements when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. It then counts pairs based on these remainders.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the key steps in the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to zero.
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are initialized as empty dictionaries.

2. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element `num` in the array:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` is calculated.
     - `mod_y = num % y` is calculated.
     - `count` is incremented by the sum of the values in `mod_x_map` for `mod_x` and `mod_y_map` for `mod_y`.
     - `mod_x_map` is updated with the remainder of `num` when divided by `x`.
     - `mod_y_map` is updated with the remainder of `num` when divided by `y`.

3. **Appending Results**:
   - After processing all elements, the `count` is appended to the `results` list.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are printed.

### Issues in the Program
The main issue lies in the calculation of `mod_x`. The program uses `mod_x = -num % x`, which is not the correct approach to determine the remainder for the condition `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x`.

#### Correct Calculation
To correctly determine the remainder for `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x`, we should calculate `mod_x` as `num % x` and look for pairs `(a[i] % x, a[j] % x)` such that `(a[i] % x + a[j] % x) % x == 0`. This means we should be looking for pairs of remainders `(r1, r2)` such that `(r1 + r2) % x == 0`.

### Correct Approach
Instead of using `mod_x = -num % x`, we should:
1. Calculate `mod_x = num % x`.
2. For each `num`, find the complement `comp_x = (x - mod_x) % x` that, when added to `mod_x`, results in a multiple of `x`.
3. Use `mod_y = num % y` and directly count pairs based on `mod_y`.

### Correct Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = [0] * x
        mod_y_map = [0] * y
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            comp_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            count += mod_x_map[comp_x] + mod_y_map[mod_y]
            mod_x_map[mod_x] += 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y] += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `mod_x`. The correct approach involves calculating `mod_x` as `num % x` and finding the complement `comp_x` such that `(mod_x + comp_x) % x == 0`.

Final: **False**
