The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place, meaning the list `pq` will now satisfy the heap property. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, i) for each price in `prices` and its corresponding index `i`.**
