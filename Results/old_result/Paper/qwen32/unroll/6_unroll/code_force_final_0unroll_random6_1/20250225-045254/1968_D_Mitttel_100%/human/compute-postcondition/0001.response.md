The given code snippet initializes a variable `mx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `p`, `s`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the newly introduced variable `mx`.

Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element in `p` is a distinct integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of turns; `mx` is 0.**
