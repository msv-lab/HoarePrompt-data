### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Construct `k` bridges on consecutive rows of an `n x m` grid, ensuring the supports are within `d` distance apart.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost to install a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a[i, j] + 1`.
- **Constraints:** 
  - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns.
  - Distance between any pair of adjacent supports in a row must be no more than `d`.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - **Implementation:** 
     - Initializes the first `d` elements of the row with `a[i, j] + 1`.
     - Uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to the current column.
     - Ensures that the supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
   - **Annotations:**
     - The state of `row` after the loop is correctly described as having the first `d` elements incremented by `2` and the rest updated based on the heap.
     - The final return value is the last element of the updated `row`, representing the minimum cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Purpose:** Read input, compute costs for each row, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Reads the input parameters and the grid.
     - Computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - Sums the costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
   - **Annotations:**
     - The state of `costs` is correctly described as a list of values returned by `func_1` for each row.
     - The state of `total_costs` is correctly described as a list of sums of every possible `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
     - The final output is the minimum value from `total_costs`.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Consecutive Rows Constraint:** The program calculates the cost for each row individually and sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows. However, it does not explicitly ensure that supports in consecutive rows are placed within `d` distance apart. This could be a critical issue if the problem requires that supports in consecutive rows also respect the `d` distance constraint.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles `k = 1` and `k = n` correctly by finding the minimum cost for a single row and the minimum sum of costs for all rows, respectively.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the main concern: the program does not explicitly handle the constraint that supports in consecutive rows must be within `d` distance apart. This is a significant oversight because the problem description specifies that the distance constraint applies to supports within a row and between consecutive rows.

Given the problem description, the requirement that supports in consecutive rows must be within `d` distance apart is essential. The program as written does not enforce this constraint, making it incorrect for the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
