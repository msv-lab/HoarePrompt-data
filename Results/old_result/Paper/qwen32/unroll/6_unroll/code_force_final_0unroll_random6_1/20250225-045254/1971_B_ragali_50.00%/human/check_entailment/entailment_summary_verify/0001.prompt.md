You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It prints 'YES' if the string contains more than one unique character; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If the string contains more than one unique character, it also prints a modified version of the string based on specific conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**:
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - Each subsequent line contains a string `s` of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output "YES" followed by a rearrangement of the string `s` that is not equal to `s` if possible.
   - If no such rearrangement exists, output "NO".

3. **Key Points**:
   - A rearrangement is possible if the string has more than one unique character.
   - If the string has only one unique character (i.e., all characters are the same), rearrangement is impossible.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters**:
   - It creates a set `a` from the string `s` to determine the number of unique characters.
   - If the length of set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are multiple unique characters, and a rearrangement is possible.

3. **Generating a New String**:
   - If rearrangement is possible, it attempts to generate a new string by splitting and concatenating the string in the middle.
   - It then checks if this new string is different from the original string `s`.
   - If the new string is not different, it checks the reversed string `s[::-1]`.
   - If neither the middle split string nor the reversed string is different from `s`, it tries another middle split approach.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the string has only one unique character, it correctly outputs "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Rearrangement Logic**:
   - The logic for generating a new string is not robust enough. It relies on specific slicing and reversing techniques that may not always produce a different string.
   - For example, consider the string `"aaaab"`. The middle split approach will produce `"aabaaa"`, which is different, but the program's logic does not guarantee this for all cases.
   - The reversed string approach is also not guaranteed to produce a different string if the original string is a palindrome or has a symmetric pattern.

2. **Output Consistency**:
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the new string, but the logic for generating the new string is not foolproof, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee a correct rearrangement for all possible input cases, especially when the string has a specific pattern or symmetry.

**Correctness: False**

The program should be revised to ensure a correct rearrangement is always produced when possible.
