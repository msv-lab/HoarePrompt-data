You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

    #The program returns (0, 3)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a tuple of two integers. The specific values returned are determined by the internal logic of the function, which evaluates various sums and differences, but for the provided example, it returns `(0, 3)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `r` and `l`, which are integers satisfying 0 <= l <= r < n, and `ops`, a list that stores operations performed. It recursively modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers derived from `r` and `l`. The function does not return any value.

    return lst
    #The program returns the list `lst` where elements from index `r` to `l` are all `n` (with `n` = `l - r + 1`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies a list `lst` by setting all elements from index `r` to `l` to the value `n` (where `n` is the length of the sublist from `r` to `l` inclusive) and returns the modified list.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function tries to find the optimal range `[l, r]` to perform the MEX operation on. However, the logic to calculate the sum `sm` is incorrect. The sum `sm` should be calculated based on the MEX value of the subarray, not just the square of the length of the subarray.
   - The MEX value should be calculated for the subarray `lst[i:j+1]`, and then the sum should be updated based on this MEX value. The current implementation does not correctly compute the MEX value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations, but it does not correctly generate the operations needed to maximize the sum. It recursively calls itself and appends operations without ensuring that these operations actually maximize the sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the MEX operation on the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` and update the operations list. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are optimal.
   - The function also contains redundant operations and does not correctly update the array `lst` to reflect the MEX operation.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the provided code does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this output. The MEX value for the subarray `[2, 1]` should be `0`, and then for the subarray `[0, 1]` should be `2`. The code does not correctly compute these MEX values and does not generate the correct operations.

### Conclusion:

The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
