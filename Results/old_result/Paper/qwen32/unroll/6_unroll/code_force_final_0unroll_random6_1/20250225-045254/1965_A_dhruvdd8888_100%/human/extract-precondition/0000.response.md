Precondition: **The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), the number of piles. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
