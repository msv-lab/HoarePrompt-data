### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters.
   - A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - If no such string can be constructed, we should output "NO".
   - If it's possible, we should output "YES" followed by the constructed string.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads `t` (the number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, it outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in the described pattern.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string by repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times. This results in a string where every 'B' is a special character, and there are exactly `n` special characters.
   - The program checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200, but since `n` is at most 50, the length of the string will always be less than 200 (specifically, it will be `3 * (n // 2)` which is at most 75).

3. **Validation Against the Example:**
   - For `n = 6`, the program constructs "AAB" * 3 = "AAABAAB", which has 6 special characters ('A' at positions 1, 3, 5, and 'B' at positions 2, 4, 6).
   - For `n = 1`, the program outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters.
   - For `n = 2`, the program constructs "AAB" * 1 = "AAB", which has 2 special characters ('A' at position 1 and 'B' at position 2).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description and produces valid outputs for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
