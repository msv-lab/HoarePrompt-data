### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not accurately determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

To form another rectangle, either dimension (`a` or `b`) must be even. This is because only if one of the dimensions is even can the rectangle be cut into two parts that can potentially form a new rectangle. The original program's logic is flawed because it only considers the evenness of `b` and ignores `a`.

The corrected version of the function should check if either `a` or `b` is even:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly check the necessary condition for forming a new rectangle.

### Final: **False**
