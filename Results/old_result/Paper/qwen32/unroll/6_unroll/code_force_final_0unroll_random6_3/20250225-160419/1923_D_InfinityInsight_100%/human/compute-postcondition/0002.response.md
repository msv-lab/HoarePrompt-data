The code snippet creates a list `ans` with `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, and `last`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and len(a) == n, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is [-1], `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to -1**.
