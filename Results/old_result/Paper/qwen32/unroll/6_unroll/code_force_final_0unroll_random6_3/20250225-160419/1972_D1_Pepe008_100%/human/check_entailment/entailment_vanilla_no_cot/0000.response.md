Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the logic used in the program is incorrect.

Let's analyze the condition more closely:
- The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be written as:
  \[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
  for some integer \(k\).
- This can be rearranged to:
  \[ a = (k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) - b \]
  \[ a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \]
- This implies that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\), which simplifies to \(a\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot (\gcd(a, b) - 1)\).

The program provided does not implement this logic correctly. Instead, it seems to be using some derived formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of such pairs.

This approach can be optimized using mathematical properties, but the provided program's logic does not align with this or any correct approach.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
