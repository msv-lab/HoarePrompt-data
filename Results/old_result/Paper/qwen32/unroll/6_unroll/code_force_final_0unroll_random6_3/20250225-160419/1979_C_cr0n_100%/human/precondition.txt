test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The total number of outcomes across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
