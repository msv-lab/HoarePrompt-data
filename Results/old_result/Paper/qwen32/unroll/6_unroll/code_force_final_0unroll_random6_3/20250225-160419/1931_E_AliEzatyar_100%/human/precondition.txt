The function `count_zero` is not directly related to the described problem. However, based on the problem description, we can define the input variables as follows: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6. `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
