Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a` before duplicates were removed; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with duplicates removed; `counter` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each unique element in the original list `a` before duplicates were removed; `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements that were removed, calculated as `n - len(a)`; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
