The code snippet provided initializes a new empty list named `output2`. The initial state specifies that `x` and `n` are integers with the condition 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `output1` is also an empty list. The execution of the code does not affect the values of `x`, `n`, or `output1`; it only introduces `output2` as an additional empty list.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list.**
