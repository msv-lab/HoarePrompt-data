You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, alphabet is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and the loop has printed a series of words based on the input values of n in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78) and prints a specific word based on the value of `n`. The printed word is constructed using the lowercase English alphabet and follows specific rules depending on the value of `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Let's analyze the code to identify the issues:

1. **Logic for `n > 52`:**
   - The code appends `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` for `n > 52`.
   - This is incorrect because the sum of the positions of three letters can never exceed 78 (since the maximum value for each letter is 26, and 26 * 3 = 78). Therefore, `n > 52` is not the right condition to handle all cases.

2. **Logic for `n > 27`:**
   - The code appends `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` for `n > 27`.
   - This is also incorrect. The sum `n` can be between 28 and 52, and the code should handle these cases properly to find the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Logic for `n == 27`:**
   - The code sets the word to `'aay'` for `n == 27`.
   - This is correct since the smallest word with a sum of 27 is `'aay'`.

4. **Logic for `n <= 26`:**
   - The code appends `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` for `n <= 26`.
   - This is incorrect because the minimum sum of three letters is 3 (for the word `'aaa'`), so `n` should never be less than 3.

To handle all cases correctly, the program needs to iterate through possible combinations of three letters and find the lexicographically smallest word that sums up to `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        for i in range(26):
            for j in range(26):
                for k in range(26):
                    if i + j + k + 3 == n:
                        word = alphabet[i] + alphabet[j] + alphabet[k]
                        break
                if word:
                    break
            if word:
                break
        print(word)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program checks all possible combinations of three letters and finds the lexicographically smallest word that sums up to `n`.
