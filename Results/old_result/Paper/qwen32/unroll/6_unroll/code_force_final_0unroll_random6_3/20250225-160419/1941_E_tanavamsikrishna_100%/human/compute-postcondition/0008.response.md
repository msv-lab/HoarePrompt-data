Functionality: **The function reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`). It then calculates the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows, where each row's cost is determined by a separate function `func_1` with the maximum distance `d`. The function outputs this minimum sum.**
