Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost in all cases. Let's analyze the code and find the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost for Odd `A`**:
   - The code contains a logical error in the calculation for odd `A`:
     ```python
     X = A // 2
     print(X)
     print(X * C + B)
     ```
   - Here, `X` is the number of pairs of yogurts, and the code prints `X` before calculating the cost.
   - The correct calculation should be:
     ```python
     X = A // 2
     remaining = A % 2
     print(X * C + remaining * B)
     ```

2. **Incorrect Condition for Promotion**:
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. It should be `if B * 2 <= C` to correctly consider the promotion when buying two yogurts is not more expensive than buying them individually.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 <= C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            pairs = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(pairs * C + remaining * B)

# Example input:
# 4
# 2 5 9
# 3 5 9
# 3 5 11
# 4 5 11

# Expected output:
# 9
# 14
# 15
# 20
```

With these corrections, the program should work correctly for all test cases. Since the original program has these issues, it is considered incorrect.
