### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The logic revolves around the following observations:

1. If there is a pair of friends (i, p_i) such that p[p_i] = i, then sending invitations to both i and p_i will ensure that both friends attend the party. This is because i's best friend is p_i and p_i's best friend is i, and both receive invitations.

2. If no such pair exists, then Monocarp needs to invite at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 come to the party. This is because each friend can only come if their best friend is also invited, and without a direct mutual pair, inviting 2 friends might not guarantee that both can attend.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It first checks for any such pair (i, p_i) where p[p_i] = i, and if found, it prints 2. If no such pair is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 3.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described above and handles the constraints provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
