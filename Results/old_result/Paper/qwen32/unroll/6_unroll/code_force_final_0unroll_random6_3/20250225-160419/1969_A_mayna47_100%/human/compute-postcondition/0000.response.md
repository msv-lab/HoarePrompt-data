The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 for each test case. After executing `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input, while the other variables (`t` and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer input provided by the user, where 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct.**
