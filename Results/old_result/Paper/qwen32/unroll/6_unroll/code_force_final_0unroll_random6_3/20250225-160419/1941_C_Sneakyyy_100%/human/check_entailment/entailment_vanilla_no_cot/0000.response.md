Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it handles the removal of characters to make the string beautiful. The program only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in blocks of three consecutive characters and increments the answer by 1 when it finds such a substring, then skips the next two characters. This approach is flawed because it does not account for overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie" and does not guarantee that the minimum number of deletions is made.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would find "map" and remove it, then skip the next two characters, leaving "pie" intact, resulting in a total of 1 deletion. However, the correct answer would be 2 deletions to make the string beautiful.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a similar method to ensure that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are considered and the minimum deletions are calculated.
