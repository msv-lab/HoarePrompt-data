You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the given friendship dynamics and outputs the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions. This involves understanding how the friendship values change over time as pairs are chosen.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - There are `n` children and `m` pairs of friends with given friendship values.
   - The teacher chooses `k` pairs of children randomly and independently.

2. **Friendship Value Changes:**
   - If a chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - If a chosen pair is not friends, their friendship value remains 0.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\).
   - We need to calculate \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
   - `s` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of expected friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

3. **Processing Friend Pairs:**
   - The program iterates over the `m` friend pairs, adding their friendship values to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program then iterates `k` times, updating `s` in each iteration.
   - The formula used for updating `s` is incorrect. It seems to assume a linear increase in expected friendship values, which is not accurate.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Formula:**
  - The formula used in the program for updating `s` is incorrect. It does not accurately reflect the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
  - The expected value should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the cumulative increase in their friendship values.

- **Modular Arithmetic:**
  - The program uses modular arithmetic correctly for the final output, but the intermediate calculations are incorrect.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program, particularly the incorrect formula for updating the expected sum of friendship values, the program is not correct.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
