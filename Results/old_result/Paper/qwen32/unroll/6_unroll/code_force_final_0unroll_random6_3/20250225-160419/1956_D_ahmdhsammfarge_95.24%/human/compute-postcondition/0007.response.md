The value of `n` is assigned the value of `l - r + 1`. The values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The condition that the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0 is still valid.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that now contains an additional element [r + 1, l + 1] making it have [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, r + 1], and [r + 1, l + 1]. The condition that the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0 has been identified. `n` is `l - r + 1`.**
