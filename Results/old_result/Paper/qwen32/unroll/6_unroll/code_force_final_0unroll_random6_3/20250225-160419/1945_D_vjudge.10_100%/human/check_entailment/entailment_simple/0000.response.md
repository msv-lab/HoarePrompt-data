Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why.

### Problem Analysis:
Kirill needs to bribe people to move up in the queue so he can be among the first `m` people. To do this, he can bribe a person at position `i` to swap places with him, paying `a[i]` coins. Additionally, for each person `k` between `i` and Kirill's current position, he needs to pay `b[k]` coins.

### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend, we need to consider the following:

1. **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach**: We need to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position in the queue.
2. **Heap or Priority Queue**: We can use a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost to bribe people and move up the queue.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `pergunta` (which is the number of test cases) instead of the correct variable to track the minimum cost.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The loop in `func_1` iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, but it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to move Kirill to the first `m` positions. It incorrectly assumes that the minimum cost is simply the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all positions and the minimum `a[i]` for positions less than `m`.

### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve using a priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to move Kirill to each position. This would involve iterating through the queue and updating the cost to move Kirill to each position based on the costs `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The function `func_1` has incorrect logic and is called with the wrong parameter.

Correctness: **False**
