To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the effect of the loop on the variables. The loop provided is:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

Here, `t` is an input integer that determines the number of times the loop will iterate. The loop body contains a call to `func_1()`, but since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code, we can only make assumptions based on the information given. 

Given the information, the only variable that is directly affected by the loop is the loop variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable (commonly used when the loop variable is not needed). The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains unchanged.

Since `func_1()` is not defined, we cannot determine any specific changes it might make to other variables. However, based on the provided code, the only thing we can definitively state is that the loop will execute `t` times, and the loop variable `_` will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during these iterations.

Thus, the output state, focusing on the variables in the loop head and body, is:

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged.**
