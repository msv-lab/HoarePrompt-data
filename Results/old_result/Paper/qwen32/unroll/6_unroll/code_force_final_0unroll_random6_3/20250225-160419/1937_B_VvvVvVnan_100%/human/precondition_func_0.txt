Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). The second and third lines of each test case contain binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} respectively, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
