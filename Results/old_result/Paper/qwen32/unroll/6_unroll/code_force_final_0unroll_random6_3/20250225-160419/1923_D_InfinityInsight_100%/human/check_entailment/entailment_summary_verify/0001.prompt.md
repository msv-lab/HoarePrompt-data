You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes. It returns a list `ans` of the same length `n`, where each element is calculated based on specific conditions related to the sizes of the slimes and their cumulative sums.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided program to understand whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or -1 if it is impossible. The provided program uses two functions to solve this problem: `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Function 1: `func_1(a, x)`
- This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the index of the smallest element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
- If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
- If an element equal to `x` is found, it returns the index + 1. Otherwise, it returns the index of the smallest element greater than `x`.

### Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`
- This function calculates the minimum number of seconds each slime takes to be eaten.
- `left` is a prefix sum array where `left[i]` is the sum of the sizes of the first `i` slimes.
- `last` keeps track of the last position where a new size appears in the array `a`.
- `ans` is the result array where `ans[i]` will be the minimum number of seconds for the i-th slime to be eaten.
- The function iterates over the slimes starting from the second one.
- If a slime is smaller than its previous neighbor, it can be eaten immediately (in 1 second).
- For other cases, the function calculates a value `x` which is the sum of sizes of slimes up to the current one minus the current slime's size minus 1.
- It then finds the index `inx` where the prefix sum is at least `x` using `func_1`.
- It also considers the last position where a new size appeared (`last[i - 1]`).
- The minimum of these two indices is used to determine the minimum number of seconds for the current slime to be eaten.
- If no such position is found, it remains -1.

### Analyzing the Correctness
The given program attempts to solve the problem by keeping track of prefix sums and the last occurrence of each size, but it does not correctly determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

- The program does not consider all possible ways the process can go, and the logic for determining when a slime can eat its neighbor is flawed.
- The use of prefix sums and binary search does not directly relate to the problem of finding the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
- The logic for updating `ans` based on `inx` and `last[i - 1]` does not correctly simulate the process of slimes eating each other.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic and approach need to be revised to correctly simulate the process of slimes eating each other and determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
