Reasoning: 

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. However, there is an issue with the function `func_1` which is supposed to calculate the cost for a single test case.

1. **Input Parsing**: The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the input is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is described as a binary string (without spaces), the correct way to read the input would be `input().strip()` to get the string and then convert it to a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().strip()))`.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic within `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0. This logic is based on the assumption that each 0 encountered after a 1 requires a shift of all preceding 1s, which is not necessarily the minimum cost way to sort the string. The provided logic does not correctly account for the minimum cost of sorting the string in all cases.

3. **Example Mismatch**: The example provided in the comments within `func_1` shows a state where `ans` is 9, but this does not match the expected output for the given input string. For the input `11000`, the correct minimum cost to sort the string is 9, but this is not a general solution and the logic within `func_1` does not guarantee correctness for other test cases.

4. **Function Call**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` itself is flawed, the overall program is incorrect.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. Hence, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
