Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. The program's approach is flawed based on the problem description and the annotated states provided.

The program tries to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray within `a` that contains all distinct elements of `a`. However, the task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, not to find the minimum length of a subarray with all distinct elements.

The correct approach should be to identify the longest contiguous subarray where the elements can still be made uniform using the given operation. If the entire array can be made uniform by the operation, the answer is -1. Otherwise, the answer is the length of the array minus the length of this longest subarray.

The provided code does not correctly address this requirement. It does not consider the operation's ability to make elements uniform and incorrectly tries to find a subarray with all distinct elements, which is unrelated to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
