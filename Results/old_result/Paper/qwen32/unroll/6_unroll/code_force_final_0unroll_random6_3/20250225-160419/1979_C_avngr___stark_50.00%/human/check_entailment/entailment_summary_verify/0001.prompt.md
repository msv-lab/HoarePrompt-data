You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1

    -1

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m = m * k[i]
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        c.append(int(m / k[i]))
    hcf = func_1(c)
    for i in range(n):
        c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
    if sum(c) >= m / hcf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')

def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
    return hcf



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first element in the list `numbers` and all subsequent elements in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to distribute bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` on `n` outcomes such that the total bet `Σx_i` is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome `k_i * x_i` for `i = 1, 2, ..., n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - It calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`. This is a common multiple that can be used to determine the bets.

3. **Determining Bets:**
   - It then calculates the bets `c_i` for each outcome as `c_i = m / k_i`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the returned amount `k_i * c_i` equals `m`.
   - It calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all `c_i` values to simplify the bets while maintaining the ratio.
   - It divides each `c_i` by the HCF to get the simplified bets.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It checks if the sum of the simplified bets `Σc_i` is less than `m / HCF`. If this condition holds, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The core logic of the program is to find bets that satisfy the condition `Σx_i < k_i * x_i` for all `i`. By setting `x_i = m / k_i`, it ensures that `k_i * x_i = m` for all `i`. Simplifying the `x_i` values by their HCF does not change the ratio but ensures the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.
- The check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect. The correct check should be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` should actually be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf`, but the intention is to check if the total bets are less than the minimum return, which is `m / hcf`. However, the condition `sum(c) >= m / hcf` is actually checking if the total bets are greater than or equal to the minimum return which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` should be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf / min(k)`, but since `m / hcf` is already the minimum return, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is correct as it stands because `m / hcf` is the minimum return for the simplified bets.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and outputs the bets or `-1` based on the feasibility of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets or determine that no such bets are possible.

Correctness: **True**
