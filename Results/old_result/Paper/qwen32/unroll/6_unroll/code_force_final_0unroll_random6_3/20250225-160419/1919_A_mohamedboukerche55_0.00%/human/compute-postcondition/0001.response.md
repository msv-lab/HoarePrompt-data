The provided loop reads a number `t` which indicates the number of iterations, and for each iteration, it reads a line of input containing two integers `a` and `b`. After the loop, the variables `a` and `b` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `t` will remain unchanged as it is only used to control the number of iterations.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and a and b are integers with the values from the last iteration of the loop, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.**
