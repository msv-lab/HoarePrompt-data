Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of changes required to make the number of '1's in `s1` equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, allowing only changes from '0' in `s1` to '1'.**
