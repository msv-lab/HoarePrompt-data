Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers where the length of `a` is between 2 and 100, and each element in `a` is between 1 and 10^9. It also accepts an integer `num2` which should be equal to the length of the list `a`. The function returns `True` in Case_1 and `False` in Case_2.**
