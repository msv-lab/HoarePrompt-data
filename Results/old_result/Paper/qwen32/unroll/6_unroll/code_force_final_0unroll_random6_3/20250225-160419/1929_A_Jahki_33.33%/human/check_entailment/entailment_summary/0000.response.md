### Reasoning:
The goal of the problem is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array. To maximize the beauty, we want to arrange the array in a way that maximizes the sum of positive differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements and the elements themselves.
3. It checks if the array is already strictly increasing using the `func_1` function. If it is, the beauty is `0` because no rearrangement will increase the beauty.
4. If the array is not strictly increasing, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is strictly increasing. If it is, the beauty is `0` because the array is already in the optimal order. If it is not, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly.

The execution summary confirms that `func_1` works as intended, and the main logic of the program aligns with the problem's requirements.
