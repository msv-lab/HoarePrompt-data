### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins.
- Each winning outcome has a multiplier `k_i`, and the amount received is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
2. **LCM Calculation**: It calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`.
3. **Bet Calculation**: For each outcome, it calculates the bet as `prod // k_i` where `prod` is the LCM of the multipliers.
4. **Sum Calculation**: It sums up all the bets.
5. **Validation**: If the sum of the bets is less than the LCM, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **LCM Usage**: The LCM is used to compute the bets. The idea is to ensure that the sum of the bets is less than the return for each outcome. The bets are calculated such that the sum of the bets divided by each `k_i` should be less than the LCM divided by `k_i`, which simplifies to the sum of the bets being less than the LCM.
- **Bet Calculation**: The calculation `prod // k_i` ensures that the bets are proportional to the LCM and inversely proportional to each `k_i`. This is a valid strategy because:
  - The sum of the bets is `sum(prod // k_i for i in range(n))`.
  - For each outcome `i`, the amount received if it wins is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`.
  - The sum of the bets is strictly less than `prod` if and only if `sum(prod // k_i for i in range(n)) < prod`.

#### Example Validation:
- **Test Case 1**: `3 3 7`
  - LCM = 21
  - Bets = `[7, 10.5, 3]` (rounded to integers: `[7, 10, 3]`)
  - Sum of bets = `20`
  - Amount received for each outcome: `[21, 30, 21]`
  - The sum of bets is less than the amount received for each outcome.
  
- **Test Case 2**: `3 3`
  - LCM = 3
  - Bets = `[1, 1]`
  - Sum of bets = `2`
  - Amount received for each outcome: `[3, 3]`
  - The sum of bets is less than the amount received for each outcome.
  
- **Test Case 3**: `5 5 5 5 5`
  - LCM = 5
  - Bets = `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sum of bets = `5`
  - Amount received for each outcome: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - The sum of bets is not strictly less than the amount received for each outcome, so the correct output is `-1`.

The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not guarantee a correct solution for all cases. The provided program logic is correct based on the problem constraints and examples.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
