To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly computes the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to a given integer `n` based on the rules provided.

Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Alphabet Mapping**:
   - The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to get a string of all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - The index of each letter in the string corresponds to its position in the alphabet (i.e., 'a' is at index 0, 'b' is at index 1, ..., 'z' is at index 25).

2. **Logic for Constructing the Word**:
   - **If `n > 52`**:
     - The program constructs a word by taking the letter at index `n - 53` in the alphabet and appending 'zz' to it.
     - This is because the maximum sum of the positions of three letters where the first letter is not 'z' is 26 + 26 + 26 = 78, and the minimum sum where the first letter is 'z' is 26 + 1 + 1 = 28. Therefore, if `n > 52`, the first letter must be 'z' (position 26), and we need to account for the remaining sum by adjusting the second letter.
     - The smallest possible second letter is `alphabet[n - 53]`, and the third letter is always 'z'.
   - **If `n > 27`**:
     - The program constructs a word by taking 'a' as the first letter, the letter at index `n - 28` in the alphabet as the second letter, and 'z' as the third letter.
     - This logic works because if `n > 27`, the sum of the positions of the three letters can be achieved by having 'a' as the first letter, a letter between 'a' and 'z' as the second letter, and 'z' as the third letter.
   - **If `n == 27`**:
     - The program constructs the word 'aay'.
     - This is a special case where the only way to achieve the sum 27 with three letters is 'a' + 'a' + 'y' (1 + 1 + 25 = 27).
   - **Otherwise (if `n <= 27`)**:
     - The program constructs a word by taking 'a' as the first and second letters, and the letter at index `n - 3` in the alphabet as the third letter.
     - This logic works because if `n <= 27`, the sum of the positions of the three letters can only be achieved by having 'a' as the first two letters and a letter between 'a' and 'z' as the third letter.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The logic ensures that the word constructed is always the lexicographically smallest possible word for the given `n`. For example, when `n = 24`, the program constructs 'aav', which is lexicographically smaller than 'ava' or any other possible combination that sums to 24.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
