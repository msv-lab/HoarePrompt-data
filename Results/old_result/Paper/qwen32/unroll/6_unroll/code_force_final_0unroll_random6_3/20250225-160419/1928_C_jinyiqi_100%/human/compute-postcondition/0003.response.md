To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive). For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`. If `i` is a divisor, it appends `i` to `output1` and appends `x // i` to `output2`.

Let's break it down:
- `output1` will contain all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
- `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`. These divisors are `x // i` for each `i` in `output1`.

After the loop completes, `output1` and `output2` will contain pairs of divisors of `x` such that the product of each pair is `x`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` is a list of divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
