Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row such that the conditions are met. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the given constraints.
   - Specifically, the logic for maintaining a sliding window of size `d+1` and calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The cost calculation should ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

2. **Incorrect Sliding Window Logic**:
   - The current implementation uses a min-heap to find the minimum cost up to a certain point, but it does not correctly account for the requirement that supports must be placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The loop that processes the heap does not correctly handle the condition that the support must be placed within `d` distance of the previous support.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the row length `m` is very small or where the maximum distance `d` is very large or very small.

4. **Optimization Issues**:
   - The current approach may not be efficient enough for the constraints, particularly given that `m` can be up to `2 * 10^5`. A more efficient dynamic programming approach or a sliding window technique that correctly handles the constraints would be necessary.

To correct the program, a more robust approach to calculating the minimum cost for placing supports in a row while respecting the distance constraint `d` would be needed. This might involve a dynamic programming solution or a more sophisticated sliding window technique that correctly handles the placement of supports.
