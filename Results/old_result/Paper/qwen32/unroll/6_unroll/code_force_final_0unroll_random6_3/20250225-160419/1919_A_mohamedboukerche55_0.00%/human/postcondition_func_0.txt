The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'alice' if the sum is odd. The final state of the program is that it has processed all `t` test cases and printed the appropriate result for each.
