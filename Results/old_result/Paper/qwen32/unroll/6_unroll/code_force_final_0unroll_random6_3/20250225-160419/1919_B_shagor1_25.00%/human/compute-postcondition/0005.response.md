To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given code and initial state:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `n`: The length of the string `s`.
   - `s`: A string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
   - `neg`: The count of '-' characters in the string `s`.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The expression is `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.
   - This means:
     - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the expression evaluates to `n - 2 * neg`.
     - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the expression evaluates to `n`.

3. **Interpreting the expression:**
   - `n - 2 * neg`:
     - `n` is the total number of characters in the string `s`.
     - `2 * neg` is twice the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
     - Subtracting `2 * neg` from `n` effectively counts the number of '+' characters and subtracts the number of '-' characters.
     - This can be interpreted as the net count of '+' characters minus the count of '-' characters.
   - `n`:
     - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means all characters in the string `s` are '-' characters. In this case, the expression evaluates to `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be `n - 2 * neg` if the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, or if there are more '+' characters than '-' characters.
   - The output will be `n` if the string contains only '-' characters.

Based on the above analysis, the output of the print statement can be described as follows:

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the count of '-' characters in the string s)**
