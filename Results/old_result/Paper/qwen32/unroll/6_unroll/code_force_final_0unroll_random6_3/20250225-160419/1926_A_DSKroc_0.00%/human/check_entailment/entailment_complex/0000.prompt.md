Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) â€” the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the variables `ac` and `bc` will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's in the respective string of length 5, but these values will not be stored or accessible after the loop for each test case completes. The state of `t` and the input strings remains unchanged.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the variables `ac` and `bc` will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's in the respective string of length 5. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`. The state of `t` and the input strings remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting only of 'A' and 'B'. It then prints 'A' if the string contains more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
