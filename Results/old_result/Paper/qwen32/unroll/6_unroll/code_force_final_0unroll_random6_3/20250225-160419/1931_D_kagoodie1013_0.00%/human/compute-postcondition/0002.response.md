To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how it modifies the `results` list.

The loop iterates over each test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, it calculates a `count` by checking the number of elements in the list `arr` that, when taken modulo `x` or `y`, match certain conditions. This count is then appended to the `results` list.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:
1. For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)`, initialize `count` to 0.
2. Initialize two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the frequency of numbers in `arr` modulo `x` and `y`, respectively.
3. For each number `num` in `arr`:
   - Calculate `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - Increment `count` by the number of times `-num % x` has been seen before (tracked in `mod_x_map`) and the number of times `num % y` has been seen before (tracked in `mod_y_map`).
   - Update `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current number's modulo values.
4. Append the final `count` for the current test case to the `results` list.

After all test cases have been processed, the `results` list will contain the counts for each test case.

The `test_cases` list and the structure of the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are not part of the output state as they are not modified in a way that affects the final output. The only variable that is modified and contributes to the output state is `results`.

Output State: **results is a list containing the count of pairs for each test case, where each count is determined by the logic described above.**
