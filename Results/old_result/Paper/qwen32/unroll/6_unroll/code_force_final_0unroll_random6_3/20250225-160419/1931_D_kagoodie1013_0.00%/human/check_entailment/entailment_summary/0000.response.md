Reasoning:
The problem description defines a "beautiful pair" \(\langle i, j \rangle\) as one where:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of elements based on their remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively. However, there is a crucial mistake in the program's logic.

The program incorrectly calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` instead of `num % x`. This will lead to incorrect results because the conditions for a "beautiful pair" require the actual remainders of the elements, not their negated remainders.

Let's correct the logic:

1. For each element `num` in the array, compute `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
2. To find the number of valid pairs `(a_i, a_j)` such that \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ x)\), we need to look for pairs of remainders `(mod_x, -mod_x % x)`.
3. To find the number of valid pairs `(a_i, a_j)` such that \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ y)\), we need to look for pairs of remainders `(mod_y, mod_y)`.
4. The program should correctly update the counts in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly count the beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
