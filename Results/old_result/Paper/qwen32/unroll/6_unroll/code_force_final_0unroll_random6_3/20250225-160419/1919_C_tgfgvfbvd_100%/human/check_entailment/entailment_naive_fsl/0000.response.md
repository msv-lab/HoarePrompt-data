Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to track the smallest elements and count certain transitions, but it does not accurately compute the penalty as defined.

Let's analyze the logic of the given program with an example:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output `3`, but the expected output is `3` which seems correct for this specific case, but let's consider another case to see if the program fails.

Consider the input:
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
The program will output `0`, but the expected output is `0` which seems correct for this specific case as well, but let's consider a more complex case.

Consider the input:
```
1
8
8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
```
The program will output `1`, but the expected output is `1` which seems correct for this specific case as well, but let's consider another case.

Consider the input:
```
1
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
The program will output `7`, but the expected output is `7` which seems correct for this specific case as well, but let's consider another case.

Consider the input:
```
1
8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
The program will output `0`, but the expected output is `0` which seems correct for this specific case as well, but let's consider another case.

Consider the input:
```
1
8
1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6
```
The program will output `3`, but the expected output is `2`. This is because the optimal split could be `s=[1,2,3,4,5,6]` and `t=[3,4]` with penalties `p(s)=5` and `p(t)=0`, but the program seems to be counting transitions incorrectly.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and fails to provide the minimum possible penalty in all scenarios. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
