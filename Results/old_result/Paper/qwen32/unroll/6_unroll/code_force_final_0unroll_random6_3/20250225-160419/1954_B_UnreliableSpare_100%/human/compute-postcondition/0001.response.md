The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string values, converts each of these string values into integers, and then stores them in a list named `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code.

Since `n` is specified to be the input integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers, we can infer that `arr` will now hold the list of integers that were input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**
