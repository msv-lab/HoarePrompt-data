Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it outputs two lines. The first line contains up to `k` integers selected from the left half of the array, prioritizing pairs of identical integers. If there are not enough pairs, it includes single integers until `k` integers are reached. The second line follows the same logic but uses only integers from the right half of the array.**
