You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: - After all iterations, the `results` list will contain the results for each of the `t` test cases.
    #   - The `idx` variable will have been incremented by `2 + n` for each test case, where `n` is the number of integers in that test case.
    #   - The `t`, `data`, and other variables not modified by the loop will remain unchanged.
    #
    #Given the above explanation, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the results for each of the t test cases)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It calculates a specific value based on the frequency of each integer in the list and returns this value for each test case. The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program seems to be counting combinations of sticks based on their lengths but does not check the triangle inequality condition, which is crucial for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This condition must be checked for every combination of three sticks.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The sticks have lengths 1, 2, 4, and 8 (since the lengths are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3). The only combination that forms a non-degenerate triangle is (2, 4, 8), but 2 + 4 is not greater than 8, so no valid triangle can be formed. Hence, the output should be 1 for the combination (1, 2, 4).

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
The program will likely output a non-zero value for this input because it counts combinations without checking the triangle inequality.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all combinations of three sticks and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality condition before counting them as valid triangles.
