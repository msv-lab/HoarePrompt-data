To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given code and understand how the variables change throughout the execution. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It also reads `m` lines, each containing three integers representing pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{1}\) modulo \(M\). Since \(n(n-1) \equiv 1 \pmod{M}\) is not always true, it seems there is a misunderstanding here. Typically, `c` would be the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n(n-1)\) modulo \(M\), but here it seems to be simplified to the inverse of 1, which is 1.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `a` is initialized to 0.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - For each of the `m` pairs of friends, the friendship value `f` is added to `a`.

4. **Calculating `s`:**
   - For each of the `k` excursions, the value of `s` is updated using the formula:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
   - Since `c` is 1, the formula simplifies to:
     \[
     s = s + i \cdot m + a
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     s = s + i \cdot m + a \quad \text{for each } i \text{ from } 0 \text{ to } k-1
     \]
   - Summing this over all `i` from 0 to `k-1`, we get:
     \[
     s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (i \cdot m + a)
     \]
     \[
     s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i \cdot m + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a
     \]
     \[
     s = m \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i + a \cdot k
     \]
     \[
     s = m \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2} + a \cdot k
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2} + a \cdot k
     \]

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Finally, `s` is taken modulo \(M\).

**Output State:**
The final value of `s` for each test case is calculated as:
\[
s = \left( \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2} + a \cdot k \right) \% M
\]

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **the value of `s` calculated as \(\left( \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2} + a \cdot k \right) \% M\) for each test case.**
