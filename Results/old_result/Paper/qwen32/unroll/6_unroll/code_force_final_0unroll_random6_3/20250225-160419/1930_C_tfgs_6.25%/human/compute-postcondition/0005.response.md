The code snippet `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` to a set and then back to a list. This operation removes any duplicate elements from the list `a`. The variables `n` and `counter` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them directly.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`.
- `counter` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each unique element in the modified list `a`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `a` will no longer contain any duplicate elements.
- The `counter` object will still reflect the frequency of each unique element before the list was converted to a set, as it is not updated in the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a`; `a` is a list of integers with duplicates removed; `counter` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each unique element in the modified list `a` before duplicates were removed.**
