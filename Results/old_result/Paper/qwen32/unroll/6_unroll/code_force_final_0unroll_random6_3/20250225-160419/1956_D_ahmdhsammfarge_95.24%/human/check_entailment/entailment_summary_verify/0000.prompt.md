You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function modifies the input list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a new sublist containing `n` elements, each equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of the original sublist (`l - r + 1`). It also appends several operations to the `ops` list.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it meets the problem description.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. However, there are a few issues with the logic and the way the operations are constructed.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function is supposed to find the subarray `[l, r]` that maximizes the sum after replacing the subarray with its MEX value.
    - The current implementation calculates the sum as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This formula is incorrect because it doesn't actually compute the MEX value of the subarray.
    - The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and the sum should be recalculated based on this MEX value, not `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations to set all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.
    - The current implementation is recursive and doesn't correctly handle the operations. It seems to be trying to set the subarray elements to the MEX value but in a way that doesn't match the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
    - This function is supposed to perform the operations and update the list.
    - The logic here is also incorrect. It appends operations and modifies the list but doesn't correctly calculate the MEX value or ensure the operations are minimal.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the provided code does not correctly calculate the MEX value and the operations. It might produce incorrect operations that do not maximize the sum or do not follow the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX value for subarrays and does not construct the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
