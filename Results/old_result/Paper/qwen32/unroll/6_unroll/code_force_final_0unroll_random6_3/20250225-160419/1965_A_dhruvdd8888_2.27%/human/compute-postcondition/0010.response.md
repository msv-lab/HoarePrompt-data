Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `nums` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order starting from 0, that were originally represented as strings in the input set, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 1 or 2; `cd` is 0.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that the variable `cd` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
