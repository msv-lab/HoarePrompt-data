Reasoning: 

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to `x`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` merely calls `find_max` with a fixed value of `31`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

The function `find_max` attempts to recursively process the array based on the bit position, but it does not correctly implement the logic to check the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of segments against `x`. Instead, it appears to be trying to count segments where the XOR of the segment does not have a set bit at the current position, which is not the correct approach.

The logic for splitting the array into segments and checking the condition `(a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x` is not correctly implemented in the provided code.

Therefore, the program as described does not meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
