`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `f`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
