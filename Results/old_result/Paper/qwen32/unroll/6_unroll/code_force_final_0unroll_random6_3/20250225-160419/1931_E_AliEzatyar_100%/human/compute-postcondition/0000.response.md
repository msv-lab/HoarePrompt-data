The code simply initializes a variable `counter` to 0. No other variables are affected, and the initial state of `num` remains unchanged.

Output State: **num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing integers. The first integer in each test case is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. Each test case then consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and m (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; counter is 0.**
