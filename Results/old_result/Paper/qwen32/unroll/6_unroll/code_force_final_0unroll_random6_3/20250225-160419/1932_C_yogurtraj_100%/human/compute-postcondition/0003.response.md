Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It computes a list `y` of length `n` based on specific rules involving the elements of `a` and the characters in `s`, and prints this list.**
