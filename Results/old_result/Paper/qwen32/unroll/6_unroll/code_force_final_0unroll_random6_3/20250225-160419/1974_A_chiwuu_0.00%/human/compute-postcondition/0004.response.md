Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints a value `t` for each test case based on the given logic, which involves operations including multiplication, division, and conditional checks. The final state of the program is a series of printed values of `t` corresponding to each test case.**
