You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a. num2 is an integer representing the length of the array a, so num2 should be equal to len(a).
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is equal to len(a); `order` is the number of non-increasing consecutive pairs in the list a.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :

        #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
- **Beauty Calculation**: Sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
- **Input**:
  - Number of test cases \(t\).
  - For each test case:
    - Length of array \(n\).
    - Elements of the array \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).
- **Output**: Maximum beauty for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided reads multiple test cases, sorts the array for each test case, and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

#### Key Steps of the Program:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reads the length of the array and the array elements.
2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorts the array in ascending order.
3. **Calculating Beauty**:
   - Initializes `beauty` to 0.
   - Iterates over the sorted array and adds the difference between consecutive elements to `beauty`.
4. **Output**:
   - Prints the calculated beauty for each test case.
5. **Condition to Print 0**:
   - Uses `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the beauty as described.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Condition to Print 0**:
   - The condition to print 0 is incorrect. The program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using `func_1`. However, the beauty can still be maximized even if the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order. The beauty calculation should always be performed, and the result should be printed.
   - The `func_1` function is unnecessary and incorrect for determining whether to print 0 or the calculated beauty.

### Correctness:
The program incorrectly uses `func_1` to decide whether to print 0 or the calculated beauty. The beauty should always be calculated and printed regardless of the initial order of the array.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
2
3
1 3 2
3
2 1 3
```
- For the first test case, the array `[1, 3, 2]` is not sorted, but the beauty can still be calculated as `2` by sorting it to `[1, 2, 3]`.
- For the second test case, the array `[2, 1, 3]` is not sorted, but the beauty can be calculated as `2` by sorting it to `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The program will incorrectly print `0` for the first test case because `func_1` returns `False`.

### Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly uses a condition to print 0 based on whether the array is sorted, which is not necessary. The beauty should always be calculated and printed. The `func_1` function should be removed, and the beauty calculation should be performed for every test case.
