In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `r` and the range is `t`. This means that the loop will execute `t` times, with `r` taking on values from 0 to `t-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`

The only variables in the loop head are `r` and `t`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The value of `r` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range(t)` function.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `t` is already defined with the condition 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, no further adjustment is needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`; `r` is not adjusted as it is controlled by the loop**
