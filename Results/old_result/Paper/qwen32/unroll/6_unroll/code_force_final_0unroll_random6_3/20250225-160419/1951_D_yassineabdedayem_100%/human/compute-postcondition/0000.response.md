Output State: **`t` is an input integer, each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, representing the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `k` for each test case remain as specified in the initial state, as they have not been modified by the provided code snippet.
