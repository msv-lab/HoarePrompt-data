To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the operations happening within the loop:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cur_arr`: List of non-negative integers.
   - `bit`: An integer between 0 and 29.
   - `new_arr`: An empty list.
   - `xor`: Initialized to 0.
   - `thing1`: Initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `i` in `cur_arr`:
     - `xor` is updated by performing an XOR operation with `i`.
     - The condition `if not xor >> bit & 1` checks if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0.
     - If the condition is true, `xor` is appended to `new_arr`, and `xor` is reset to 0.

3. **Output State**:
   - `cur_arr`: Remains unchanged.
   - `bit`: Remains unchanged.
   - `new_arr`: Contains elements of `xor` values that had the `bit`-th bit as 0, in the order they were encountered and reset.
   - `xor`: Contains the final XOR value after the loop, which could be 0 if the last `xor` was appended to `new_arr` and reset, or the XOR of the remaining elements if the loop ended without appending.
   - `thing1`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Given the above operations, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` <= 29, `new_arr` is a list containing intermediate XOR values where the `bit`-th bit was 0, `xor` is the final XOR value after the loop, `thing1` is 0.**
