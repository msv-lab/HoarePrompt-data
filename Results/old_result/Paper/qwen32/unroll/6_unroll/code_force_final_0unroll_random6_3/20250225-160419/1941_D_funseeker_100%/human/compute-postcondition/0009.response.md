To determine what will be printed by the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, we need to carefully follow the given initial state and understand the operations performed to derive the set `ans`.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `n`, `m`, and `x` are given values.
2. `ans` is a set of values derived from repeatedly applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` based on the values of `c` over `m` iterations.
3. After the iterations, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed.
4. Regardless of whether `0` was in `ans`, `n` is included in `ans`.

### Understanding `ans`:
- `ans` starts as a set derived from some operations involving `q`, `r`, and `c` over `m` iterations.
- After the iterations, `0` is removed from `ans` if it exists.
- Finally, `n` is added to `ans`.

### Sorting and Printing:
- The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement sorts the set `ans` and prints its elements.

### Final Analysis:
- Since `n` is always included in `ans` and `0` is removed if it exists, the set `ans` will always contain `n` and possibly other values derived from the operations.
- The exact values in `ans` depend on the specific values of `n`, `m`, and the operations performed, but we know `n` will definitely be one of the values in the final set.
- The `sorted(ans)` function will sort these values in ascending order before printing.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the sorted values of the set `ans`, which includes `n` and possibly other values derived from the operations, with `0` excluded if it was present.

### Output:
Output: **the sorted values of the set `ans` (which includes `n` and possibly other values derived from the operations, with `0` excluded if it was present)**
