You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `q` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The given Python program correctly determines whether the three digits in each test case form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither ("NONE") based on the provided conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
   - This is done using `q = int(input())`.

2. **Iterating Through Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - This is achieved using `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program then checks if the digits form a "STAIR" with the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - Next, it checks if the digits form a "PEAK" with the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the correct response for each test case as per the given conditions.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `1 2 3`
  - `a < b < c` is true (1 < 2 < 3), so the output is "STAIR".
- **Test Case 2:** `3 2 1`
  - Neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true, so the output is "NONE".
- **Test Case 3:** `1 5 3`
  - `a < b > c` is true (1 < 5 > 3), so the output is "PEAK".
- **Test Case 4:** `3 4 1`
  - `a < b > c` is true (3 < 4 > 1), so the output is "PEAK".
- **Test Case 5:** `0 0 0`
  - Neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true, so the output is "NONE".
- **Test Case 6:** `4 1 7`
  - Neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true, so the output is "NONE".
- **Test Case 7:** `4 5 7`
  - `a < b < c` is true (4 < 5 < 7), so the output is "STAIR".

The program correctly matches the expected output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it accurately checks the conditions and outputs the correct results based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
