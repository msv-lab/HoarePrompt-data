Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not optimally split the array to minimize the penalty. The logic in the code for deciding which subsequence to add the current element to is flawed and does not guarantee an optimal split.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 2 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
One optimal way to split the array is to have `s = [1, 3, 5]` and `t = [2, 4]`. The penalty `p(s) = 2` (since `1 < 3` and `3 < 5`) and `p(t) = 1` (since `2 < 4`), so the total penalty is `2 + 1 = 3`. However, another optimal split is `s = [1, 2, 5]` and `t = [3, 4]`, which gives `p(s) = 2` (since `1 < 2` and `2 < 5`) and `p(t) = 1` (since `3 < 4`), so the total penalty is `2 + 0 = 2`, which is the minimum possible penalty.

However, the given code might not correctly handle this case and could produce a higher penalty. The code's logic for deciding which subsequence to add an element to is not optimal and can lead to suboptimal splits.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty for every potential case.
