lst is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of the array and the subsequent integers represent the elements of the array. Specifically, lst[0] is the number of test cases (t), and for each test case, the first element is the length of the array (n) followed by n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) such that 2 <= n <= 50 and 0 <= a_i <= 99 for each element a_i in the array.
