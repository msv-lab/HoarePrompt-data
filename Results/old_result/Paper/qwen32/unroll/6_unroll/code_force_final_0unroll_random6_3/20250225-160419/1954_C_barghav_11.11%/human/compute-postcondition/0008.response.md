The given loop iterates over the indices of the list `b` and prints each element of `b` without any newline characters in between. The initial state description does not affect the output of this loop because the loop only deals with the list `b`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')
```
The loop will print all elements of `b` concatenated together.

Since the loop only prints the elements of `b`, the output state will simply be the concatenation of all elements in `b`.

Output State: **the concatenation of all elements in `b`.**
