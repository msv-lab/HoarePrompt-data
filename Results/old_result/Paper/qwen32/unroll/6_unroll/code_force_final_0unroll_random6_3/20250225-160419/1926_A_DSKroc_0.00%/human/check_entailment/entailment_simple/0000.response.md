Reasoning:  
The given annotated program contains a logical error. The variables `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration of the for loop, which means they only count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the last string processed. The program should print the result for each test case inside the loop, not outside. As it stands, the program only prints the result for the last test case, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
