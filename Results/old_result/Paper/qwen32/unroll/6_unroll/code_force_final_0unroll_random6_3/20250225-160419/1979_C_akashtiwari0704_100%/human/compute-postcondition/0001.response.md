The only variable in the loop head is `T` and the range it iterates over is `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `t` is already given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which ensures that the loop can execute.

The other variables (`n`, `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`) are defined inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop itself will execute. They are part of the loop body and not the loop head.

Given that `t` is already within the valid range for the loop to execute, no further adjustments are needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 0 (before the first iteration of the loop)**

This state ensures that the loop will execute at least once since `t` is at least 1. The variable `T` starts at 0 before the first iteration of the loop.
