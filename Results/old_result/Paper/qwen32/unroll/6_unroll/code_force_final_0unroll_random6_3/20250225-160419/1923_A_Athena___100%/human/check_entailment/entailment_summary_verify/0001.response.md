Let's carefully analyze the given program and its function summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to move the chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of operations. The operation allowed is moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the list `a` of `n` integers representing the cells (0 for free, 1 for occupied by a chip).

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program first removes leading zeros (free cells) from the list `a` using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - Then, it removes trailing zeros using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - This step ensures that we only consider the segment of the ribbon that contains chips and potentially free cells between them.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of operations needed.
   - It then iterates through the remaining list `a` and increments `res` for each free cell (0) encountered.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `res` for each test case.

### Correctness of the Program:
The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior: it counts the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the list. This count indeed represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a contiguous block. Each free cell (0) within the segment bounded by the first and last chip (1) will need to be filled by a chip moving from the right, and the number of moves is equal to the number of free cells.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After trimming: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Free cells (0s): `1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After trimming: `1`
   - Free cells (0s): `0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After trimming: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Free cells (0s): `0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - After trimming: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Free cells (0s): `2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Example:**
   - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After trimming: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Free cells (0s): `3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to form a single contiguous block of chips by counting the free cells in the relevant segment of the ribbon.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
