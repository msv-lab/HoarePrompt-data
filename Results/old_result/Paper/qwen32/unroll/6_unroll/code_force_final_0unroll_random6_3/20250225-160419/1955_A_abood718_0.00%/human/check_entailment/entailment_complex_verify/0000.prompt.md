You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: t is the same integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a result based on specific conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`; otherwise, it prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost in all cases. Let's analyze the code and find the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost for Odd `A`**:
   - The code contains a logical error in the calculation for odd `A`:
     ```python
     X = A // 2
     print(X)
     print(X * C + B)
     ```
   - Here, `X` is the number of pairs of yogurts, and the code prints `X` before calculating the cost.
   - The correct calculation should be:
     ```python
     X = A // 2
     remaining = A % 2
     print(X * C + remaining * B)
     ```

2. **Incorrect Condition for Promotion**:
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. It should be `if B * 2 <= C` to correctly consider the promotion when buying two yogurts is not more expensive than buying them individually.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 <= C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            pairs = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(pairs * C + remaining * B)

# Example input:
# 4
# 2 5 9
# 3 5 9
# 3 5 11
# 4 5 11

# Expected output:
# 9
# 14
# 15
# 20
```

With these corrections, the program should work correctly for all test cases. Since the original program has these issues, it is considered incorrect.
