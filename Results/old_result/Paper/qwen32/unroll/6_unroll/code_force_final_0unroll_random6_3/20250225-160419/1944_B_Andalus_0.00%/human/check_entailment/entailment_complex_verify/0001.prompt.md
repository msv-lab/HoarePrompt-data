You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The output state consists of T test cases, each producing two lines of output. For each test case, the first line contains up to k integers selected from the left half (lft) and the right half (rgt) of the input list `lst`, prioritizing pairs of identical integers from each half. If there are not enough pairs to reach k integers, single integers from the left half are added until k integers are reached. The second line follows the same logic but exclusively uses integers from the right half (rgt). The state of variables `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `lst` remains unchanged after each iteration of the loop, except for the temporary variables `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` which are recalculated for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it outputs two lines. The first line contains up to `k` integers selected from the left half of the array, prioritizing pairs of identical integers. If there are not enough pairs, it includes single integers until `k` integers are reached. The second line follows the same logic but uses only integers from the right half of the array.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program in the context of the problem description:

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of length `2n` that contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice.
- We need to find two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that:
  - `l` is a subset of the first half of `a`.
  - `r` is a subset of the second half of `a`.
  - The bitwise XOR of elements of `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements of `r`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).

3. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles:**
   - `ldb` (list of duplicates) is populated with elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft`.
   - `rdb` (list of duplicates) is populated with elements that appear twice consecutively in `rgt`.
   - `sng` (list of singles) is populated with elements in `lft` that do not have a duplicate immediately following them.

4. **Building Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to build `l` and `r` by:
     - Adding pairs of duplicates from `ldb` to `l` and `r` until `k` elements are added.
     - Adding singles from `sng` to `l` and `r` until `k` elements are added.
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` on separate lines.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Subset Condition:** The program does not ensure that `l` and `r` are subsets of the first and second halves of `a`, respectively. For example, if `lft` contains `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the program might add `2` twice to `l` even if `2` appears only once in `lft`.
- **XOR Condition:** The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. For example, if `l` contains `[1, 2]` and `r` contains `[3, 4]`, their XOR values might not be equal.
- **Handling of `sng` List:** The program uses the same `sng` list for both `l` and `r`, which might lead to invalid subsets.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not guarantee that the output arrays `l` and `r` meet the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
