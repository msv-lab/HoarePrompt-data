The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, or `cw` defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'Bob'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables: `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, and `cw`.
   - `nums` is a list of 1s with the same length as the initial `nums`.
   - `ls` is the sum of the original `nums` list.
   - `nw` is `True`.
   - `cw` is `False`.

2. The `print` statement is:
   ```python
   print('Bob')
   ```
   This statement explicitly prints the string `'Bob'`.

3. Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, or `cw`, their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply:

Output: **Bob**
