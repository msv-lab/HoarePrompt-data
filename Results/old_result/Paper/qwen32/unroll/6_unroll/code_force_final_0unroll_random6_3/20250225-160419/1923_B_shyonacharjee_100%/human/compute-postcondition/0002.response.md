Output State: **For each test case, the output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, indicating whether it is possible to defeat all monsters with the given constraints. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` will not retain their values after the loop completes as they are local to each iteration. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases to be processed.**
