Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It then calculates the squared distances between two pairs of opposite corners and prints the smaller of the two squared distances for each test case.**
