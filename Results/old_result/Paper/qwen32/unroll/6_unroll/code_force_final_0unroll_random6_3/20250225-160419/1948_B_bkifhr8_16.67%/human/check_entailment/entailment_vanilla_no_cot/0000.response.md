Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. The program only performs a single pass through the list and checks if the list is sorted after that, which is insufficient.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Single Pass Only**: The program only performs one pass through the list to check and split elements. This is not enough because a single pass might not be sufficient to sort the array. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, after the first pass, it becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is not sorted. A second pass is needed to check if further splits are necessary.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting**: The program only checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and greater than 10. If so, it splits the element. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility that splitting an element might make the array sortable even if the current element is not greater than the previous one.

3. **No Loop for Repeated Operations**: The program does not loop to repeatedly check and split elements until the array is sorted or no further splits are possible.

To fix the program, you would need to implement a loop that continues to split elements and check if the array is sorted until no further splits are possible or the array is sorted. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_sort_by_splitting(arr):
    while True:
        modified = False
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] >= 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                arr = arr[:i] + digits + arr[i+1:]
                modified = True
                break
        if not modified:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_sort_by_splitting(arr):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This version of the program will repeatedly split elements and check if the array is sorted until no further splits are possible.
