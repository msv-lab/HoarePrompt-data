### Reasoning:

Let's delve deeper into the provided program and its annotations to verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice starts).
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
- Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Key Points:
- Both players play optimally.
- Alice's strategy is to maximize the MEX by including as many unique elements as possible.
- Bob's strategy is to minimize the MEX by preventing Alice from adding unique elements.

#### Program Analysis:
The program calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequencies of elements. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1(arr)`:**
   - It initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n+1` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - It iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest index `i` such that `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1.
   - It prints this index `i` as the MEX.

#### Annotations and Behavior:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
  - The function will be called multiple times with different arrays, and the sum of all `n` values across these arrays does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

- **State During Frequency Count:**
  - `freq` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `freq[j]` is the count of how many times the integer `j` appears in `arr`.

- **State During MEX Calculation:**
  - `cou` keeps track of the count of unique elements found so far.
  - The loop breaks when `cou` reaches 2 or when a zero frequency element is encountered.
  - The loop prints the value of `i` at the point of breaking, which is the MEX.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in `arr` or appears only once, which is the MEX.
- The program assumes that the optimal play strategy is inherently handled by the MEX calculation, which is correct because the MEX is a direct result of the unique elements and their frequencies in `arr`.

#### Challenging the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment suggests that the program correctly calculates the MEX based on the frequencies of elements, which is accurate.
- The optimal strategies for Alice and Bob are indirectly handled by the MEX calculation, as the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` after all elements have been processed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequencies of elements, which is the optimal result for the game when both players play optimally.

**Final:** **True**
