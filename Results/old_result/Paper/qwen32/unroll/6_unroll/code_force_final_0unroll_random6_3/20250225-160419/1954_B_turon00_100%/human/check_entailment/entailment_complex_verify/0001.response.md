### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing the operation of replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array, `cnt` to 0, and `ans` to `n`.
   - It then iterates over the array, counting contiguous subsequences of identical elements.
   - If a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to consider the last contiguous subsequence.
   - It checks if the array has only one element (`n == 1`) or if the longest contiguous subsequence is the entire array (`ans == n`). If either condition is true, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it attempts to find the longest contiguous subsequence of identical elements and uses its length to determine the answer. This approach does not account for the correct strategy to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove such that the resulting array cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations. The program does not consider this requirement.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, one must identify the longest contiguous subsequence of identical elements and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this subsequence in such a way that the resulting array cannot be made uniform.
   - The correct approach involves more complex logic than simply counting contiguous subsequences.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program's logic does not align with the requirements of the problem, and it fails to provide the correct solution.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
