The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`N`, `vals`, `den`, `vprod`), but the `print` statement itself does not depend on these variables. Instead, it directly prints the integer `-1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables in the Initial State:**
   - `N` remains unchanged.
   - `vals` remains unchanged.
   - `den` is the product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for the corresponding `r` in `vals`.
   - The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **The Print Statement:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement is independent of the values of `N`, `vals`, `den`, and `vprod`.
   - It directly prints the integer `-1`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of the variables `N`, `vals`, `den`, and `vprod`.

Output: **-1**
