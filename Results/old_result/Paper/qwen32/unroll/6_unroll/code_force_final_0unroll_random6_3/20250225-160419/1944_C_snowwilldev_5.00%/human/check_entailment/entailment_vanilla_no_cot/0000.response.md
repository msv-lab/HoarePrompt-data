Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the final score of the game when both players play optimally. The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `c` by counting the occurrences of each number in the input array `a` and then determining the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `a` or appears less than twice. However, this approach does not consider the optimal moves that Alice and Bob would make during the game.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. Both players play optimally.

The optimal strategy involves Alice picking elements that maximize the MEX while Bob tries to block her. The MEX of `c` at the end of the game depends on the parity of the counts of numbers in `a` and the order in which they are picked.

A correct approach would involve:
- Counting the occurrences of each number in `a`.
- Determining the smallest number that is not present or has an odd count, as this will be the MEX after all elements are picked optimally.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] % 2 == 1:
                print(i)
                break
        else:
            print(N)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the MEX by checking the smallest number with an odd count, as this number will remain in `c` after all elements are picked optimally.
