You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the given array or appears exactly once.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Mechanics**: Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them (Bob). The game ends when `a` is empty.
2. **Objective**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
3. **MEX**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

### Strategy:
- Alice will aim to include as many low numbers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- Bob will aim to prevent Alice from including certain numbers to minimize the MEX.

### Optimal Play:
- If a number `i` appears an even number of times, Alice can always ensure that she gets the last occurrence of `i` (if she plays optimally).
- If a number `i` appears an odd number of times, Bob can ensure that he gets the last occurrence of `i` (if he plays optimally).

The key observation is that the MEX will be the smallest number `i` such that:
- If `i` appears an even number of times in `a`, Alice can append it to `c`.
- If `i` appears an odd number of times in `a`, Bob will ensure it is not in `c`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` to find the smallest number that meets the criteria for being the MEX.

### Code Logic:
1. **Counter Creation**: `mpp = Counter(arr)` counts the occurrences of each number in `arr`.
2. **Finding MEX**:
   - The code iterates through numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If a number `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks (this means `i` does not appear in `arr` at all, so it is the MEX).
   - If `i` appears exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks (this means `i` appears an odd number of times, and since `first` is `True`, it means this is the first odd occurrence, making `i` the MEX).
   - If `i` appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not correctly handle the case where `i` appears an even number of times. It should only consider the first odd occurrence.
- The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The MEX should be the smallest `i` such that:
  - If `i` appears an even number of times, Alice can append it.
  - If `i` appears an odd number of times, it should be skipped unless it is the smallest number that meets the criteria.

### Correct Approach:
- Iterate through numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each number `i`, check if it appears an even number of times. If so, it can be part of `c`.
- The first number `i` that appears an odd number of times and is not included in `c` will be the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
