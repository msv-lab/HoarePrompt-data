Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints a sequence of integers from `a` based on specific rules: first, it prints `k` pairs of integers that appear twice in the first half of `a`; then, if needed, it prints additional integers from the first half of `a` that appear only once, up to a total of `k` such integers; finally, it prints the remaining integers from the second half of `a` that appear twice, ensuring the total number of printed integers matches the requirements.**
