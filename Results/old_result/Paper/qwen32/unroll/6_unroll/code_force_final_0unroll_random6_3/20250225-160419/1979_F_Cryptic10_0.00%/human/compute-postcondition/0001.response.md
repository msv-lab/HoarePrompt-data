Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, such that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**

In natural language, this means that the variable `n` still represents the number of vertices in the graph, with the same constraints. The variable `path` remains an empty list. A new variable `remaining_vertices` has been created and is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`.
