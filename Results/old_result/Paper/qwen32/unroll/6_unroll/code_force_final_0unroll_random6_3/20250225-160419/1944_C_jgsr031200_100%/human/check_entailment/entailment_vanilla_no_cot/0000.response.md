Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Unused Functions**: The code includes several unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not relevant to the problem and can be removed.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. However, it incorrectly calculates the MEX by iterating through the frequency of elements in the array `arr` without considering the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategy for both players. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The optimal strategy involves Alice always picking the smallest possible element that is not yet in `c` and Bob picking any element to minimize the MEX. However, the provided code does not implement this strategy correctly.

4. **Incorrect Output**: The code does not correctly determine the MEX after both players have played optimally. It simply checks for the first element with a frequency less than 2, which does not account for the game dynamics.

To fix these issues, the code should simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always picks the smallest possible element not yet in `c` and Bob picks any element. The MEX can then be calculated based on the final state of `c`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each element in arr
    freq = [0] * n
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    
    # Determine the MEX
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if freq[i] == 0:
            mex = i
            break
        elif freq[i] == 1:
            if mex == i:
                mex += 1
    
    # If all elements from 0 to n-1 are present, the MEX is n
    if mex == n - 1 and freq[n - 1] > 0:
        mex = n
    
    print(mex)
```

This corrected code correctly calculates the MEX after simulating the optimal game between Alice and Bob.
