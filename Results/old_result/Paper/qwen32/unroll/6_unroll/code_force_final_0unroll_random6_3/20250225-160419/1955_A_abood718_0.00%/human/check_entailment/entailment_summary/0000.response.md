Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical error in the last condition handling. When `A` is odd, the program incorrectly prints `A // 2` before printing the final cost. This extraneous print statement leads to incorrect output format and behavior. The correct approach should be to compute the cost without printing intermediate values.

Here is the correct logic breakdown:
1. If the cost of two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the cost of one yogurt (`2 * B`), then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. The total cost would be `A * B`.
2. If `C` is not less than `2 * B`, then buying in pairs is beneficial or at least not more expensive. 
    - If `A` is even, the total cost is `(A / 2) * C`.
    - If `A` is odd, the total cost is `((A - 1) / 2) * C + B` (which can also be expressed as `(A // 2) * C + B`).

The current program does not follow this last condition correctly due to the extraneous print statement.

Correctness: **False**
