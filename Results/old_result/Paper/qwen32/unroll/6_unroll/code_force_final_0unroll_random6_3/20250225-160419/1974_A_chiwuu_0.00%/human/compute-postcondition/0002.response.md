To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the loop and how it modifies the variable `t` for each test case.

The loop processes `n` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then performs a series of calculations to determine a new value for `t` based on these inputs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's logic:

1. **Read Input Values**: `a` and `b` are read as integers.
2. **Calculate `t`**: Initially, `t` is set to `b * 2`. This value is then adjusted based on whether it is divisible by 5.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is set to `t // 5`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`.
3. **Calculate `t1`**: `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
4. **Adjust `t` Based on `t1` and `a`**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`. The value of `t` is then adjusted based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15.
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`.
5. **Print `t`**: The final value of `t` for the current test case is printed.

Since the variable `t` is recalculated and printed for each test case independently, the final output state will be a series of printed values of `t` for each of the `n` test cases. The initial value of `t` in the precondition does not affect the loop's execution because `t` is recalculated from the input values `a` and `b` for each test case.

Therefore, the output state is the series of printed values of `t` after processing all `n` test cases.

Output State: **the series of printed values of `t` for each of the `n` test cases.**
