Let's analyze the program and the provided logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to a new array `c` (Alice) or just removing them (Bob). The goal is to maximize the MEX of `c` after all elements are removed from `a`.

### Optimal Strategy
- **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
- **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. For Alice to maximize the MEX, she should aim to include as many numbers as possible in `c` in increasing order. Bob, on the other hand, will try to disrupt this by removing elements that Alice might want to pick.

### Key Insight
The MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer that is not in `c`. If Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice will try to include all integers from 0 up to the maximum possible in `c`, while Bob will try to prevent this by removing elements that Alice needs.

### Program Analysis
The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` to find the smallest number that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once. This is because:
- If a number does not appear in `a`, it will be the MEX.
- If a number appears exactly once, Alice can pick it on her turn, and Bob cannot remove it, ensuring it is part of `c`.

### Correctness
The program's logic is correct. It efficiently determines the smallest number that meets the criteria for being the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally. The use of `Counter` ensures that the program can quickly check the occurrences of each number, and the iteration ensures that the smallest possible MEX is found.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally.

**Reasoning**: The program correctly determines the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the array or appears exactly once, which corresponds to the MEX of `c` after optimal play by Alice and Bob.

**Correctness**: **True**
