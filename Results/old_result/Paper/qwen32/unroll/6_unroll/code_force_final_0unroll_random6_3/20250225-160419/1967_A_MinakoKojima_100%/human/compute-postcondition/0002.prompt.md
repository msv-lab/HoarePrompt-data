Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. Additionally, the test case contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12) representing the number of cards of type i initially available. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is given at the beginning, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. `ans_list` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
