### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version against the problem description to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates a value `suma` which is supposed to represent the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The final value of `suma` is adjusted by subtracting 2 before being printed.

##### Annotations:
- The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It initializes `suma` to 0.
- It iterates over each possible value of `b` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `b`, it calculates `x` using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- It increments `suma` by `x` if `x` is positive.
- It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to add an additional 1 to `suma`.
- Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

##### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The formula used to compute `x` and the conditions to increment `suma` do not align with the problem's requirements. The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.
2. **Incorrect Output Handling**: Subtracting 2 from `suma` before printing is not justified by the problem description. There is no clear reason why this adjustment should be made.
3. **Variable Misuse**: The variables `a` and `b` in the program are incorrectly named and used. The variable `a` in the loop should represent `b` in the problem description, and vice versa.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The variable misuse and the incorrect formula used result in incorrect outputs for many test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
