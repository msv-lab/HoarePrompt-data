You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):

            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: The printed results for each of the t test cases, where each result is either the minimum of two integers if n is 2, or the maximum median of the medians of all subarrays of length 3 if n is greater than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is 2, it outputs the minimum of the two integers. If `n` is greater than 2, it finds and outputs the maximum median value among all subarrays of length 3 within the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum possible value of the number that the array can be transformed into by repeatedly applying the given operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to the median of that subarray. The task is to determine the maximum value that the entire array can be set to after performing the operation some number of times.

### Key Points:
1. **Median Selection**: For any subarray, the median is the middle element when the subarray is sorted.
2. **Transformation**: The operation can be applied multiple times, and the goal is to maximize the final value of all elements in the array.
3. **Maximum Value**: The maximum value that the array can be transformed into is the maximum median of all possible subarrays of length 3.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and considering only subarrays of length 3. For each subarray, it calculates the median and keeps track of the maximum median found.

#### Steps in the Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Handling Special Case (n=2)**: If the array length is 2, it simply prints the smaller of the two elements.
3. **Iterating Through Subarrays**: For arrays longer than 2 elements, it iterates through all possible subarrays of length 3.
4. **Calculating Median**: For each subarray of length 3, it sorts the subarray and selects the middle element (median).
5. **Tracking Maximum Median**: It keeps track of the maximum median found across all subarrays of length 3.
6. **Output**: It prints the maximum median for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program is based on the assumption that the maximum possible value that the entire array can be transformed into is the maximum median of all subarrays of length 3. However, this assumption is incorrect.

#### Why the Program is Incorrect:
- **Subarray Length**: The program only considers subarrays of length 3. However, the median of longer subarrays could potentially be larger and could lead to a higher final value for the entire array.
- **Global Maximum Median**: The maximum median value should be considered for all possible subarrays, not just those of length 3.

### Example:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
- The maximum median of subarrays of length 3 is `3` (from subarrays like `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, `[3, 4, 5]`).
- However, by considering longer subarrays, we can find a higher median. For example, the median of the entire array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `3`, but by performing operations, we can reach a final value of `4` (as shown in the problem statement).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the maximum possible value of the number that the array can be transformed into. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
