The code snippet creates a new list `sum_values` with a length of `max(numbers) + 1` and initializes all its elements to 0. This does not change the values of `t`, `numbers`, or `values`. The `sum_values` list is newly created and does not affect the pre-existing variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each read from the input; `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
