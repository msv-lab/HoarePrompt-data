### Reasoning:

The given problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations where each operation allows us to insert the sum of any contiguous subarray anywhere in the array. The key insight is that to maximize the sum, we should focus on the maximum positive sum of any contiguous subarray (using Kadane's algorithm) and then leverage the operations to repeatedly add this sum to the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Finding the Maximum Positive Sum of a Subarray:**
   - The program uses a variation of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray (`maxi`).
   - It iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum (`c`). Whenever the running sum becomes negative, it resets it to 0. During this process, it keeps track of the maximum sum encountered (`maxi`).

3. **Calculating the Maximum Possible Sum After k Operations:**
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is used to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The term `2 ** k * maxi` suggests that the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) is added to the array `k` times, considering the exponential growth of adding the maximum sum repeatedly.
   - The term `- maxi` is subtracted to correct for the initial addition of the maximum sum during the first operation (since the initial addition is not part of the `k` operations).
   - The term `sum(l)` adds the original sum of the array to the result.
   - The result is taken modulo `1000000007` to handle large numbers.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements in the array are negative, `maxi` will be 0, and the result will be the sum of the array modulo `1000000007`.
   - If the array contains positive elements, `maxi` will be the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, and the result will be maximized by repeatedly adding this sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations using the maximum subarray sum and the properties of exponential growth. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
