Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`. It then calculates and prints an integer value `ans` based on the provided `n` and `m`. The calculation involves iterating and updating a count and a value `g` until a certain condition is met, and the final result for each test case is printed as an integer.**
