Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an input integer representing the number of columns such that `m` >= 3, `k` is an input integer representing the number of bridges such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `d` is an input integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= `d` <= `m`, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is an empty list.**

The variable `total_costs` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
