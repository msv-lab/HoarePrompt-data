The function `sol` is intended to take a single integer `n` as input, but based on the problem description, the function should actually take multiple inputs per test case. Specifically, for each test case, the input consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by `k` lines of two integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n) representing the moves made. The input begins with an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
