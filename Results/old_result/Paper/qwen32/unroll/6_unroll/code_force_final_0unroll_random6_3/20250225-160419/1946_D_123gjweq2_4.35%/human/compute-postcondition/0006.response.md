The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that will iterate over `cur_arr`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `cur_arr` has at least one element. The other variables (`bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, `thing1`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect whether the loop executes.

Given the above, for the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` <= 29, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
