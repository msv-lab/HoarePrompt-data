Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins. Each winning outcome has a multiplier `k_i`, and the amount received is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
2. **LCM Calculation**: Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`.
3. **Bet Calculation**: For each outcome, calculate the bet as `prod // k_i` where `prod` is the LCM of the multipliers.
4. **Sum Calculation**: Sum up all the bets.
5. **Validation**: If the sum of the bets is less than the LCM, print the bets; otherwise, print `-1`.

### Correctness Evaluation
The logic in the program seems to be based on the idea that the bets should be such that the total sum of bets is less than the smallest possible return from any winning outcome. However, the program's approach may not always yield a correct solution. Here's why:

- **LCM Usage**: The LCM of the multipliers is used to compute the bets. However, the program does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for each outcome. The condition `if sumo >= prod` is not sufficient to guarantee that the solution is valid for all `k_i`.
- **Bet Calculation**: The program calculates the bets as `prod // k_i`. This does not guarantee that the total sum of bets will be less than the return for each outcome. For example, if all multipliers are the same, the bets will all be the same, and their sum might not be less than the return for any outcome.
- **Output**: The program outputs `-1` if the sum of bets is not less than the LCM, but this condition might not cover all cases where a valid distribution of bets is possible.

### Example
Consider the test case with multipliers `3 3`. The LCM is `3`, and the bets would be `1 1` (i.e., `3 // 3`). The sum of bets is `2`, which is less than the return for any winning outcome (`3 * 1 = 3`). This case is correctly handled. However, consider a case like `2 4`. The LCM is `4`, and the bets would be `2 1`. The sum is `3`, which is less than the return for the second outcome (`4 * 1 = 4`), but not for the first outcome (`2 * 2 = 4`). The correct bets should be something like `1 1`, but the program does not guarantee this.

### Conclusion
The program does not guarantee a correct solution for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
