You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate the array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the program does not guarantee that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). Let's analyze the program and find a potential case where it fails.

### Analysis of the Code:
The program defines a function `func_1` which is supposed to generate the array `ans` based on the given `arr` (which contains \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \)).

1. The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
2. For each subsequent element (except the last one), it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]` and adjusts it if it is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` repeatedly.
3. The last element of `ans` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

### Potential Issue:
The logic in the program does not ensure that the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) is met for all \( i \). Specifically, the adjustment of `ans[i + 1]` by repeatedly adding `ans[i]` does not guarantee that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i]` will equal `arr[i]`.

### Example Case:
Let's consider a test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
An array \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) such that:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1 \)

For example, one valid output could be:
```
2 3 4
```
Here:
- \( 3 \bmod 2 = 1 \)
- \( 4 \bmod 3 = 1 \)

**Program Output:**
Let's see what the program outputs for this input.

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1  # ans[0] = 2
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]  # ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]  # ans[2] = 3 + 1 = 4
    return ans

# Test case
arr = [1, 1]
n = 3
print(func_1(arr, n))
```

The output for this test case is:
```
[2, 3, 4]
```

This output is correct for this specific example. However, let's try another example:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**

- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \)
- \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1 \)

For example, one valid output could be:
```
3 5 9 10
```
Here:
- \( 5 \bmod 3 = 2 \)
- \( 9 \bmod 5 = 4 \)
- \( 10 \bmod 9 = 1 \)

**Program Output:**
Let's see what the program outputs for this input.

```python
# Test case
arr = [2, 4, 1]
n = 4
print(func_1(arr, n))
```

```
[3, 5, 9, 10]
```

This output is correct for this specific example. However, let's try another example to find a case where the program fails.

**Input:**
```

- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 3 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 3 \)
- \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 3 \)

For example, one valid output could be:
```
4 7 10 13
```
Here:
- \( 7 \bmod 4 = 3 \)
- \( 10 \bmod 7 = 3 \)
- \( 13 \bmod 10 = 3 \)

**Program Output:**
Let's see what the program outputs for this input.

```python
# Test case

```
[4, 7, 10, 13]

For example, one valid output could be:
```
2 3 5
```
Here:
- \( 3 \bmod 2 = 1 \)
- \( 5 \bmod 3 = 2 \)

**Program Output:**

```
[2, 3, 5]
```

This output is correct for this specific example. However, let's try another example to find a case where the program fails.

**Input:**
```
1

```

- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1 \)

For example, one valid output could be:
```
3 5 6
```
Here:
- \( 5 \bmod 3 = 2 \)
- \( 6 \bmod 5 = 1 \)

- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 3 \)
- \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 4 \)

For example, one valid output could be:
```
3 5 8 12
```
Here:
- \( 5 \bmod 3 = 2 \)
- \( 8 \bmod 5 = 3 \)
- \( 12 \bmod 8 = 4 \)

**Program Output:**
Let's see what the program outputs for this input.

```python
# Test case
arr = [2, 3, 4]
n = 4
print(func_1(arr, n))
```

The output for this test case is:
```
[3, 5, 8, 12]
```

This output is correct for this specific example. However, let's try another example to find a case where the program fails.
