You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` holds the value of the last integer input within the loop. The program will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on whether the input `n` is even and less than or equal to 100, and if 'YES', it will have printed a string of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The string must have exactly `n` special characters.
- A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- If it's not possible to construct such a string, we should print "NO".
- If it's possible, we should print "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Logic for Determining the String:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO".
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If so, it prints "YES" followed by `s`.

### Evaluation of the Logic:
- **Odd `n`:**
  - If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints "NO". This is because, in a string of uppercase Latin letters, it's not possible to have an odd number of special characters (each special character requires an even number of occurrences in a valid pattern).

- **Even `n`:**
  - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times. 
  - The pattern "AAB" has 2 special characters: the first 'A' and the 'B'.
  - Therefore, repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times gives us exactly `n` special characters.
  - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for `n` up to 50 (since `3 * 25 = 75`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and ensures that the constructed string meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
