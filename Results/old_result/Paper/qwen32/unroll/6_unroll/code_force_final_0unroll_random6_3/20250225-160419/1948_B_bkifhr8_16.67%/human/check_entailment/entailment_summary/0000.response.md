Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. The program attempts to perform the operation only once for each pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the current one and is at least 10. However, this approach is insufficient because the operation can be applied multiple times and to different elements, and the program does not explore all possible transformations of the array.

The current implementation only checks if the array is already sorted after a single pass through the array, which is not enough to ensure that all possible transformations have been considered. For example, in the second test case, the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will not transform the array correctly because it only checks adjacent elements and does not consider further transformations after the first pass.

The correct approach would involve recursively applying the operation and checking if the array can be sorted, or using a more systematic method to explore all possible transformations of the array.

Correctness: **False**
