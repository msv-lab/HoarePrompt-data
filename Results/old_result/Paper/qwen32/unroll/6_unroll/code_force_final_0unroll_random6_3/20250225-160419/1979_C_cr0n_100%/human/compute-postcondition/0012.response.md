Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `N` representing the number of outcomes (where 1 <= N <= 50) and a list of integers `vals` representing the multipliers for each outcome (where each multiplier `k_i` in `vals` satisfies 2 <= k_i <= 20). The function does not return any value.**
