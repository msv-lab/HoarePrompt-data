### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the winner when both players play optimally. Let's break down the reasoning step by step to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep the current one.
   - Each player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will win.

3. **Explanation of Parity**:
   - If the total number of coins is even:
     - Alice starts with an even total.
     - She can always force Bob to face an odd total.
     - Bob will always face an odd total and force Alice back to an even total.
     - This continues until Bob is left with 1 coin, forcing Alice to leave Bob with 0 coins, making Bob the winner.
   - If the total number of coins is odd:
     - Alice starts with an odd total.
     - She can always force Bob to face an even total.
     - Bob will always face an even total and force Alice back to an odd total.
     - This continues until Alice is left with 1 coin, forcing Bob to leave Alice with 0 coins, making Alice the winner.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

The logic implemented in the program accurately reflects the optimal play strategy based on the parity of the total number of coins. The bitwise operation (`a + b & 1`) correctly determines if the sum is even or odd.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate, and the program correctly implements the solution based on the problem description. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **True**
