You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins based on the given rules. Let's analyze the logic of the program and the problem requirements.

#### Program Logic:
The program iterates over the number of consecutive losses `x` and calculates a threshold `s` such that if Sasha's initial amount `a` is at least `s`, he can guarantee to win any number of coins. The calculation of `s` is done by repeatedly adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s` for `x` iterations.

#### Problem Requirements:
The problem requires Sasha to ensure that he can always win any number of coins, regardless of the outcomes of his bets, as long as he does not lose more than `x` times in a row. This means that even if he loses `x` consecutive bets, he should be able to recover and continue winning.

#### Potential Issue:
The calculation of `s` in the program does not correctly account for the scenario where Sasha loses `x` consecutive bets and needs to recover. The logic assumes a specific strategy of betting that might not be optimal or correct for all values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the test case `k=3`, `x=2`, and `a=10`. According to the program, the calculation would be:
- Initial `s = 1`
- After 1st iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 3`
- After 2nd iteration: `s = 3 + 3 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 6`

So, the program would output "YES" for `a >= 6`. However, let's analyze this scenario:
- If Sasha loses the first two bets, he loses `1 + 2 = 3` coins, leaving him with `7` coins.
- He can then place a bet of `1` coin and win, gaining `2` coins, totaling `9` coins.
- He can place another bet of `1` coin and win again, gaining `2` coins, totaling `11` coins.
- He can continue this strategy to win any number of coins.

However, the program's logic does not correctly account for this scenario and might incorrectly output "NO" for certain values of `a`.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee correctness for all possible values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. The logic used to calculate the threshold `s` might not be optimal or correct in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
