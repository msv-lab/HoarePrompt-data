Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The issue lies in the placement of the if-else statement that prints the result. Currently, the if-else statement is placed outside the loop that processes each test case, which means it only uses the counts from the last test case to determine the output. The correct approach is to place the if-else statement inside the loop so that it prints the result for each test case individually.

Correctness: **False**
