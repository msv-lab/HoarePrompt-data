The provided code snippet only assigns the value `Decimal('Infinity')` to the variable `ans`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, or `flag`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `a` remains the same; `arr` remains the same; `flag` will be `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, it will be `False`; `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')`.**
