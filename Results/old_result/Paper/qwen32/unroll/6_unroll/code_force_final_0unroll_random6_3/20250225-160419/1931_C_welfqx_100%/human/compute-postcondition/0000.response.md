`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
