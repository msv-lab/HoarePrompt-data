To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the list `a` is constructed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: Represents the length of the permutation `p`, where \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
2. **Variable `t`**: Represents the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
3. **List `a`**: The list `a` is derived from a permutation `p` such that:
   - The elements at even indices of `a` are the reversed elements of the permutation `p` at even indices.
   - The elements at odd indices of `a` remain unchanged from the permutation `p`.

### Construction of List `a`:
- For each permutation `p` of length `n`:
  - Extract elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and reverse them.
  - Keep elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) as they are.
  - Combine these to form the list `a`.

### Example Explanation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the transformation:
- Suppose `p = [4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 5]` (where `n = 6`).
- Elements at even indices: `[4, 2, 6]` (reversed to `[6, 2, 4]`).
- Elements at odd indices: `[3, 1, 5]` (unchanged).
- Combined, `a` becomes `[6, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5]`.

### General Case:
Given the initial state, we cannot know the exact values of `p` without the input, but we can describe the transformation process.

### Output Description:
The `print(a)` statement will output the list `a` after the described transformation for each test case.

Output: **a (where a is the list formed by reversing the elements at even indices of the permutation p and keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged)**
