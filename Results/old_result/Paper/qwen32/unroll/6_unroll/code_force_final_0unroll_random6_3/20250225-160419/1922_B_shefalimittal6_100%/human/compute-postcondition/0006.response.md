For the given task, we need to focus only on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the only variable we can adjust is `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `data`, `idx`, `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted according to the given constraints.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list**.

However, since only `t` can be adjusted in the loop head, we can simplify this to:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
