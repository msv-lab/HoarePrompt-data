### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem according to the provided specifications.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and then the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `lft` (left half) and `rgt` (right half).

3. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles:**
   - For `lft`, it identifies pairs of identical integers (`ldb`) and single integers (`sng`) that do not have a pair.
   - For `rgt`, it only identifies pairs of identical integers (`rdb`).

4. **Constructing the Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - For both `l` and `r`, it first tries to fill the arrays with pairs of identical integers from `ldb` and `rdb` respectively.
   - If there are not enough pairs to reach the length `2k`, it fills the remaining spots with single integers from `sng`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed arrays `l` and `r` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program ensures that `l` and `r` are subsets of the left and right halves of the array, respectively.
- The program guarantees that the length of `l` and `r` is `2k`.
- The program ensures that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r` because:
  - Each pair of identical integers XORs to `0`, so they do not affect the overall XOR.
  - The same single integers are added to both `l` and `r`, so they do not affect the overall XOR either.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the arrays `l` and `r` according to the problem description and ensures that their bitwise XORs are equal. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
