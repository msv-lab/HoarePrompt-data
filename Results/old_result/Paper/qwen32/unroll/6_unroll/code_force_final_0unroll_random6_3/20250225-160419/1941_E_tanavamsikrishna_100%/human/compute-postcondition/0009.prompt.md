You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths in a single row of the river grid, and d is an integer representing the maximum distance between supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: `row` is a list where the first element is 1 and each element from index 1 to `d-1` is increased by 2, with the rest of the elements unchanged.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: `row` is a list where the first `d` elements are initialized as `1 + 2*i` for `i` from 0 to `d-1`, and each element from index `d` to `n-1` is updated based on the value of the last popped element from `min_heap`, the original value of `row[i]`, and 1; `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples `(row[i], i)` for all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `row`, which is the result of the last update operation involving the last popped element from `min_heap`, the original value of `row[-1]`, and 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `row`, which is a list of integers representing the depths in a single row of the river grid, and a parameter `d`, which is an integer representing the maximum distance between supports. The function returns the last element of `row` after performing update operations involving the last popped element from `min_heap`, the original value of `row[-1]`, and 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of `row`, which is the result of the last update operation involving the last popped element from `min_heap`, the original value of `row[-1]`, and 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
