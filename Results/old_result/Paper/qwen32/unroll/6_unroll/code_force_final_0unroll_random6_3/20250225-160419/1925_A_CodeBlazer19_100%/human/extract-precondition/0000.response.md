Precondition: **The function receives no direct input parameters. Instead, it reads from standard input where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be formed and the number of first lowercase English alphabets to be used, respectively.**
