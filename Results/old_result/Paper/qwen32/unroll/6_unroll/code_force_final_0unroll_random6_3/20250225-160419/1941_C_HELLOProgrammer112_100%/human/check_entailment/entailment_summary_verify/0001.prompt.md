You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s`. For each string, it calculates the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie', and subtracts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'mapie'. The result for each test case is printed as an integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` so that it no longer contains the substrings "pie" or "map". 

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the length of the string `n` (though `n` is not used in the logic).
2. Reads the string `s`.
3. Counts the occurrences of "map" (`x`), "pie" (`y`), and "mapie" (`z`).
4. Prints the result of `x + y - z`.

### Logic Analysis
The logic in the program seems flawed. Here's why:
- Counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" does not directly give the minimum number of characters to remove. For example, if "mapie" is a substring, it counts as both "map" and "pie", but removing it once suffices.
- The subtraction of `z` (occurrences of "mapie") from `x + y` is incorrect because it assumes that each "mapie" is counted twice, which isn't necessarily the case. For instance, in the string "mapiepie", "mapie" and "pie" are counted separately, but removing "mapie" once is sufficient to remove both substrings.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" is a substring of `s`. This involves checking each character and ensuring that no "map" or "pie" is formed. A more accurate approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum deletions.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for overlapping substrings and does not compute the minimum number of deletions accurately.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
