To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the `i` variable and the `range(int(input()))` expression. The loop will execute if the value provided to `range()` is greater than 0.

Here's the analysis:

1. **`i`**: This variable is the loop counter and is automatically managed by the `range()` function. We don't need to adjust its initial state manually.
   
2. **`range(int(input()))`**: The loop will execute if the integer input is greater than 0. Therefore, the state must ensure that the input value is a positive integer.

Given that the state before the loop starts includes `t` and `n`, and `alphabet`, none of these directly affect the loop execution. However, we must ensure that the input to the `range()` function is such that the loop can execute. 

Since we are not making assumptions about the input function, we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer. The state of `t`, `n`, and `alphabet` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but we can clarify that the input to the loop should be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and the input to the loop must be a positive integer**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, the final adjusted state should reflect the requirement of the input being a positive integer.

State: **the input to the loop must be a positive integer**.
