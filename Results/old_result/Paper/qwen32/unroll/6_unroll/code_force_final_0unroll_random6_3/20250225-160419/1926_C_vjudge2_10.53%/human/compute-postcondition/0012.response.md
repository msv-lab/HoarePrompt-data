To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the given loop and the initial state of the variables.

The loop is:
```python
for n in numbers:
    print(sum_values[n])
```

Given:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `numbers` is a list of `t` integers, each read from the input.
- `values` is a list initialized with the first 10 elements as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
- `sum_values` is a list initialized with the first 10 elements as `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`.
- `total` is initialized to `45`.

The loop iterates over each element `n` in the `numbers` list and prints the corresponding element from the `sum_values` list at index `n`.

Since the loop only prints values and does not modify any of the variables `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, or `total`, the state of these variables remains unchanged after the loop completes.

The output state is determined by the printed values, but since we are asked to describe the state of the variables, we note that the variables themselves do not change.

Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; numbers is a list containing t integers, each read from the input; values is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and the rest are computed based on the loop; sum_values is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and the rest are computed based on the loop; total is 45.**
