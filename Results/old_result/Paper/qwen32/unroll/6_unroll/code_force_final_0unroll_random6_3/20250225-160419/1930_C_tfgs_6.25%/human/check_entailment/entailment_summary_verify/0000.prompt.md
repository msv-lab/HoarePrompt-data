You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, increments each element of the list by its 1-based index, then outputs a list of integers where the original elements with duplicates inserted back in the correct positions are sorted in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it does not guarantee that the resulting array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible array that can be formed by the described operations.

Let's analyze why the code might not always produce the correct result:

1. **Handling Duplicates**: The code uses a `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the set `S` after the operations. However, the logic for handling duplicates and ensuring the lexicographically largest array is not robust enough. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple elements are added to the set and needs to be sorted in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order.

2. **Insertion and Deletion Logic**: The code adds `a[i] + i + 1` to the set `S` and then removes duplicates by converting `a` to a set. This step is correct, but the way it handles the sorting and construction of `b` might not always yield the lexicographically largest array.

3. **Constructing `b`**: The program sorts the unique elements of `S` in descending order and then tries to fill in the gaps with the appropriate values. However, this approach does not always ensure the lexicographically largest array because it does not consider the optimal order of insertion and deletion that could lead to a larger lexicographical order.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
4 2 3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
8 7 6 5
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Operation 1: i=4, insert `a[3] + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5`, a = [4, 2, 3]
- Operation 2: i=3, insert `a[2] + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6`, a = [4, 2]
- Operation 3: i=2, insert `a[1] + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`, a = [4]
- Operation 4: i=1, insert `a[0] + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`, a = []

The set `S` will be `{5, 6, 4, 5}` (duplicates removed: `{5, 6, 4}`), and sorting in descending order gives `[6, 5, 4]`. However, to maximize the lexicographical order, we need to consider the optimal sequence of insertions and deletions, which in this case leads to `[8, 7, 6, 5]`.

The provided code does not handle such cases correctly, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
