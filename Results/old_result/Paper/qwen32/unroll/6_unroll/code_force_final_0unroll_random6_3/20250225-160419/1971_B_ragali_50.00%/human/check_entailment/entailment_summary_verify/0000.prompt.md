You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of the string. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not guarantee that the rearranged string `r` will be different from the original string `s` for all possible inputs. Let's analyze the code:

1. The code checks if the length of the set of characters in the string `s` is greater than 1. If it is, it prints "YES" and attempts to rearrange the string.
2. The rearrangement is done by taking the second half of the string and appending the first half to it. If this rearrangement is not different from the original string, it tries to reverse the string.
3. If the reversed string is also not different from the original string, it again attempts a rearrangement by taking the second half of the string and appending the first half (excluding the middle element if the length is odd).

However, there are cases where the code will not produce a valid rearrangement:

- **Case with Repeated Characters**: Consider the string "aaabbb". The set of characters has a length greater than 1, so it prints "YES". However, the rearrangement `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]` results in "bbbaaa", which is a valid rearrangement. But if the string is something like "aabbaa", the rearrangement "bbaaaa" is not valid because it does not ensure that the rearranged string is different from the original string.

- **Case with Odd Length**: Consider the string "abcde". The rearrangement `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]` results in "cdeab". However, if the string is "abcba", the rearrangement "cbaab" is not valid because it does not ensure that the rearranged string is different from the original string.

Here is a specific counterexample:
- Input: "abcba"
- Expected Output: "YES\nbcaba" (or any other valid rearrangement)
- Actual Output: "YES\nbcabaab" (or some other incorrect rearrangement)

Thus, the code does not guarantee a correct rearrangement for all inputs, making it incorrect.
