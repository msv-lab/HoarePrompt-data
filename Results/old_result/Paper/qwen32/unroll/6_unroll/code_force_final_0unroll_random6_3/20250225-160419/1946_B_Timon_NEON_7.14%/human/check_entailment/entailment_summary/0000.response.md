### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the functions collectively meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(number)`**: This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of the given number. It aligns with the requirement to output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   
2. **Function `func_2(arr)`**: This function is intended to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the array `arr`. The function iterates through the array, keeping track of the maximum sum of subarrays ending at each position. However, based on the provided "Output hints," it seems that the function always returns `[7, 4]` regardless of the input array, which is incorrect. The function should return the correct maximum sum subarray information.

3. **Function `func_3(number, quantity)`**: This function is not utilized in the provided code snippet, and its purpose and implementation are not clear from the given hints. Since it is not used, we can ignore it for the current analysis.

#### Implementation Details:
- The main logic in the provided code snippet is:
  ```python
  max_segment = func_2(a)
  if max_segment[0] == -1:
      max_segment[0] = 0
  answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]
  print(func_1(answer))
  ```
- This logic seems to be based on the idea that the optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the maximum sum subarray. However, the incorrect behavior of `func_2` (always returning `[7, 4]`) would lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given that `func_2` does not correctly compute the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, the overall program does not meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
