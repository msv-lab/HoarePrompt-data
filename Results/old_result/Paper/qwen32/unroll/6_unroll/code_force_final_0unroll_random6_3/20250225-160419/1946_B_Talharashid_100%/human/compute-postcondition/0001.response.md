To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the calculations it performs for each test case.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it performs the following operations:
1. Reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. Reads a list `l` of `n` integers.
3. Initializes `c` (current sum) and `maxi` (maximum sum) to 0.
4. Iterates through each element `ele` in the list `l`:
   - If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, it updates `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and resets `c` to 0.
   - Otherwise, it adds `ele` to `c` and updates `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
5. After the inner loop, it updates `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and `maxi` (in case the maximum sum ends at the last element of the list).
6. It calculates the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` and prints it.

The variables `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` are local to each iteration of the outer loop and are reinitialized for each test case. The only variable that persists between test cases is `t`, which is the number of test cases and is not modified within the loop.

Given that the loop processes each test case independently and outputs the result for each one, the final output state is simply the series of results printed for each test case. Since the initial state of `t` is not changed and the other variables are local to each test case, the output state remains in terms of the printed results.

Output State: **The output state consists of the results of the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` printed for each of the `t` test cases.**
