Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum length of a contiguous subarray within `a` that contains all distinct elements of `a`. If no such subarray exists (i.e., all elements in `a` are the same), it returns `-1`. The function outputs the result for each test case.**
