### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given code and its functions in the context of the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by replacing subarrays with their MEX (Minimum Excluded Value). The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - **Purpose:** Find the optimal subarray `[i, j]` to replace with its MEX.
   - **Implementation:** The function calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray and the sums of the parts of the array outside the subarray. It does not compute the MEX of any subarray. This approach is incorrect for finding the MEX or maximizing the sum.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - **Purpose:** Add operations to a list `ops` recursively.
   - **Implementation:** The function adds operations with the same subarray bounds recursively, which does not contribute to solving the problem correctly. It does not compute the MEX or perform any meaningful operations related to maximizing the array sum.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - **Purpose:** Perform the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by replacing it with its MEX.
   - **Implementation:** The function replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX operation. It also adds multiple operations to `ops` recursively, which again does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

#### Evaluation Against Function Summaries:
- **Function Summary for `func_3`:** The summary describes the function as modifying the input list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a new sublist containing `n` elements, each equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of the original sublist (`l - r + 1`). It also appends several operations to the `ops` list.
  - **Analysis:** The summary is accurate in describing what the function does, but it does not indicate that this is the correct approach to maximize the sum of the array. The function does not compute the MEX of the subarray correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of a subarray or to maximize the sum of the array. The functions do not perform the intended operations and instead perform unrelated or incorrect operations.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
