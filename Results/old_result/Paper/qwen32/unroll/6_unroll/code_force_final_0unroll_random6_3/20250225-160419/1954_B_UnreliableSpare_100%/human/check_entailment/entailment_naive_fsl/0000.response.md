Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks for the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements and returns that length if the array is not entirely composed of the same element. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, which involves more complex logic.

Let's analyze the provided code and find a potential issue:

1. **Identifying Non-Uniform Arrays:**
   - The code first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because such an array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If the array is not uniform, it attempts to find the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements and returns that value.

2. **Issue with the Logic:**
   - The logic of finding the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements and returning that value is not sufficient to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, which involves identifying the longest sequences that can be reduced by the given operation and then determining the minimum removals required.
   - The provided code does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple sequences of identical elements and the optimal solution involves removing elements from multiple sequences.

3. **Example of Incorrectness:**
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
     - The array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is beautiful because you can choose `i = 2` to replace `arr[2]` with `arr[1]` or `arr[3]`, resulting in `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1]` or `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, and so on.
     - The provided code will output `1` because the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements is `1`. However, the correct answer is `1` because removing any single element (e.g., the `2` at index `1` or `3`) will make the array non-beautiful.
     - However, consider another test case:
       ```
       1
       7
       3 3 3 5 3 3 3
       ```
       - The array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` is beautiful.
       - The provided code will output `3` because the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements is `3`. However, the correct answer is `3` because removing the three `3`s around the `5` will make the array non-beautiful.
       - But if we consider:
         ```
         1
         7
         3 3 3 3 5 3 3 3 3
         ```
         - The array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is beautiful.
         - The provided code will output `4` because the minimum length of a sequence of identical elements is `4`. However, the correct answer is `3` because removing the three `3`s around the `5` will make the array non-beautiful.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly handle all cases and thus is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
