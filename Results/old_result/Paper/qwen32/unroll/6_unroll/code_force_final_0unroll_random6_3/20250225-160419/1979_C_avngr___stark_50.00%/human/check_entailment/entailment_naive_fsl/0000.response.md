Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distributing the bets based on the ratio of the LCM to each multiplier. However, the logic used to determine the bets and check if they meet the requirement is flawed.

Let's analyze the problem and the program:

1. **Objective**: For each test case, distribute the bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Specifically, if the i-th outcome wins, the amount received should be more than the total amount bet across all outcomes.

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - Calculate the LCM of the multipliers.
   - Distribute the bets as `m / k[i]` for each outcome, where `m` is the LCM and `k[i]` is the multiplier for the i-th outcome.
   - Normalize these bets by dividing them by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - Check if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. If not, print `-1`.

3. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not correctly checking the requirement. The requirement is that the total amount bet (`sum(c)`) should be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome (`k[i] * c[i]`).
   - The normalization step using GCD is unnecessary and does not affect the core logic of the problem.
   - The program does not correctly ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case with `n = 2` and `k = [2, 3]`.
   - The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6.
   - The bets would be `6 / 2 = 3` and `6 / 3 = 2`.
   - The total bet is `3 + 2 = 5`.
   - If the first outcome wins, the amount received is `2 * 3 = 6`, which is greater than 5.
   - If the second outcome wins, the amount received is `3 * 2 = 6`, which is greater than 5.
   - However, the program would check `sum(c) = 5` against `6 / 1 = 6`, which is correct, but the logic is flawed for more complex cases.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome. One such approach is to use the formula `c[i] = (m / k[i]) - 1` for each outcome, where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers, ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome.

Given the flaws in the logic and the counterexample, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
