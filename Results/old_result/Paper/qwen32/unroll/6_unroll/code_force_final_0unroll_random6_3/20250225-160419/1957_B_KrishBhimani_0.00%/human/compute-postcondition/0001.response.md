To understand the output state of the given loop, let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. Each iteration processes a pair of integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Inner Logic**:
    - **Bit Representation**: For each test case, the code converts `k` into its binary representation and stores the positions of the set bits (bits that are 1) in the list `arr`.
    - **Constructing the Answer**:
        - It initializes an empty list `ans` and a counter `c`.
        - It then iterates over the set bits stored in `arr`. For each set bit at position `i`, it appends `2^i` to `ans` until `c` reaches `n-1`.
        - If `c` reaches `n-1`, it appends the remaining value to `ans` which is `k0 - sum(ans)`, where `k0` is the original value of `k`.
        - Finally, it appends zeros to `ans` to ensure that the length of `ans` is `n`.

3. **Output**: For each test case, the constructed list `ans` is printed.

**Output State Description**:
- For each test case, the output is a list `ans` of length `n`.
- The list `ans` is constructed such that the sum of its elements equals `k`, and it contains the smallest possible powers of 2 that sum up to `k` (using the positions of set bits in `k`), followed by zeros if necessary to reach the length `n`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is a series of `t` lines, each containing `n` integers that satisfy the conditions described above.

Output State: **For each test case, a list of n integers where the sum of the integers equals k, and the integers are the smallest possible powers of 2 that sum up to k, followed by zeros if necessary to reach the length n.**
