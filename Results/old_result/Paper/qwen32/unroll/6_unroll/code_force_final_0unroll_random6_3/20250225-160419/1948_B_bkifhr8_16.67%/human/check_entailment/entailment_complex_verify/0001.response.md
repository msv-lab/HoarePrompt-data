### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Single Pass Through the List**:
   - The program iterates through the list only once, checking and potentially splitting elements based on the condition that the current element is smaller than the previous one and the previous one is at least 10.
   - This single pass is insufficient because splitting an element can introduce new elements that might need further splitting or reordering. The program needs to repeatedly check and process the list until no more splits are needed or the list is sorted.

2. **Nested or Repeated Processing**:
   - A nested loop or a while loop is necessary to ensure that the list is fully processed. After splitting an element, the list should be re-evaluated to check if further splits are needed or if the list has become sorted.
   - The current implementation does not account for this repeated processing, which can lead to incorrect results in cases where multiple splits are required to sort the list.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - The helper function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. However, this function is only called after a single pass through the list, which might not be sufficient to ensure the list is sorted.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case `[12, 28, 5]`:
     - The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
     - After this single pass, the program will check if the list is sorted. Since `[1, 2, 28, 5]` is not sorted, it will print "No".
     - However, further splitting `28` into `2` and `8` would result in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which still isn't sorted, but another pass might be needed to correctly sort the list.
   - The correct approach would involve repeatedly checking and splitting until the list is sorted or no further splits are possible.

### Conclusion:
Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the repeated processing required to ensure the list is fully sorted after splitting elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
