The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of card types `n`, a number of coins `k`, and a list of integers representing the initial count of each card type. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the distribution of coins among the card types, aiming to maximize the minimum number of cards of any type by using the coins.
