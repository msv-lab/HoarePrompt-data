### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step using the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- Specifically, if the i-th outcome wins, the amount received should be more than the total amount bet across all outcomes, i.e., \( \text{sum}(x) < k_i \times x_i \) for all \( i \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers \( k \) by multiplying all the \( k_i \) values together. This is correct for the purpose of finding a common multiple.

2. **Bet Distribution**:
   - The bets are calculated as \( c[i] = \frac{m}{k[i]} \), where \( m \) is the LCM. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the received amount is \( k_i \times c[i] = m \).

3. **GCD Normalization**:
   - The program then normalizes these bets by dividing them by their GCD. This step is unnecessary for the problem's requirement but does not affect the correctness of the solution since the relative proportions remain the same.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than \( \frac{m}{\text{hcf}} \). This condition is equivalent to checking if the sum of the original bets \( c[i] \) is less than \( m \). Given that \( k_i \geq 2 \), \( c[i] = \frac{m}{k[i]} < \frac{m}{2} \), and thus the sum of \( c[i] \) will always be less than \( m \).

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of the list of numbers.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment suggests that the program is incorrect due to a flawed logic in checking the condition and the normalization step. However, the reasoning provided in the assessment contains a misunderstanding. The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` is indeed correct because \( m / hcf \) is essentially the original LCM \( m \) when the bets are not normalized.

#### Conclusion:
- The program correctly calculates the bets and checks the necessary condition to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- The normalization step does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
