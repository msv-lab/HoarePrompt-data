The code snippet provided assigns the value `0` to the variable `order`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers with a length between 2 and 100, and each element `a_i` in `a` is between 1 and 10^9. Additionally, `num2` is specified to be equal to the length of the list `a`.

Since the code only modifies the variable `order` and does not affect `a` or `num2`, the values of `a` and `num2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is equal to len(a); `order` is 0.**
