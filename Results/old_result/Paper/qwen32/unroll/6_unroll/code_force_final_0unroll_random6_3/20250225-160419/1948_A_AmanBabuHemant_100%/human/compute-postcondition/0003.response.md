Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and `n` is an integer representing a value for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, the function processes the value of `n` and returns a specific result based on the value of `n`.**
