Output State: **For each of the t test cases, the variable `ans` holds the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `s` of length `n`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` retain their initial values as provided in the input, and no other variables are affected outside the loop.**
