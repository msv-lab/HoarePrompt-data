You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. For each test case, it counts and prints the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to move the chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of operations. The operation allowed is moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left. 

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the list `a` of `n` integers representing the cells (0 for free, 1 for occupied by a chip).

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program first removes leading zeros (free cells) from the list `a` using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - Then, it removes trailing zeros using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - This step ensures that we only consider the segment of the ribbon that contains chips and at least one free cell between them.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of operations needed.
   - It then iterates through the remaining list `a` and increments `res` for each free cell (0) encountered.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `res` for each test case.

### Correctness of the Program:
The algorithm works by focusing on the segment of the ribbon that contains chips and at least one free cell between them. It counts the free cells within this segment, which directly corresponds to the number of operations needed to move all chips into a contiguous block. This is because each free cell will need to be filled by a chip moving from the right, and the number of moves is equal to the number of free cells.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to form a single contiguous block of chips by counting the free cells in the relevant segment of the ribbon.

Correctness: **True**
