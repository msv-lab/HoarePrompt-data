Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n
- 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates over each possible value of b from 1 to m and calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the given conditions.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Correctness of the Logic**: The program should correctly compute the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
2. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases, such as when n or m is 1, and when gcd(a, b) is a special value (like 1 or b).

### Provided Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

### Issues Found:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs (a, b). The formula used in the program to calculate `x` and the conditions to increment `suma` do not align with the problem's requirements.
2. **Incorrect Output Handling**: The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not justified by the problem description.
3. **Variable Misuse**: The variables `a` and `b` in the program are incorrectly named and used. The variable `a` in the loop should represent `b` in the problem description, and vice versa.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not meet the problem's requirements and will not produce correct results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. The variable misuse and the incorrect formula used result in incorrect outputs for many test cases.
