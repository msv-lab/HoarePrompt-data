To determine the output state, we need to understand that the provided loop is a simple iteration over `ans_list` where each element `a` is printed. The loop does not modify any of the elements or the list itself, nor does it change any variables outside of the loop. Therefore, the state of the variables `result1, result2, ..., resultt` remains unchanged. The only effect is the printed output of each element in `ans_list`, but this does not alter the state of the variables in the initial state.

Since the loop does not affect the variables `result1, result2, ..., resultt`, the output state will be identical to the initial state.

Output State: **[result1, result2, ..., resultt]**
