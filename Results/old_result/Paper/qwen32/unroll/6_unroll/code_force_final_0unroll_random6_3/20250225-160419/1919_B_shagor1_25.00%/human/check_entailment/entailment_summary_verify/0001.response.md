Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`, where:
- `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'`
- `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`

The penalty for a subarray `c` is calculated as:
- `p(c) = |sum(c)| * len(c)`

The goal is to split `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties for all subarrays is minimized.

### Key Insight
The optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty involves forming subarrays where the sum is zero (`0`), as this would result in a penalty of `0`. If the entire array can be split into such subarrays, the total penalty will be `0`.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Counting '+' and '-'**:
   - The program counts the number of `'-'` characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
   - The number of `'+'` characters can be derived as `n - neg`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - If the number of `'+'` characters is equal to the number of `'-'` characters (`n == 2 * neg`), then it is possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of `0`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`.
   - Otherwise, the minimum penalty is `n - 2 * neg`. This formula essentially calculates the number of characters that cannot be paired to form a subarray with a sum of `0`.

### Verification with Test Cases
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `s = '+'`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: `a = [1]`, cannot form a subarray with sum `0`, penalty is `1`.
   - Calculation: `n - 2 * neg = 1 - 2 * 0 = 1` (correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `s = '-----'`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, cannot form subarrays with sum `0`, penalty is `5`.
   - Calculation: `n - 2 * neg = 5 - 2 * 5 = 5` (correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `n = 6`, `s = '+-+-+-'`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, can be split into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, penalty is `0`.
   - Calculation: `n - 2 * neg = 6 - 2 * 3 = 0` (correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `n = 10`, `s = '--+++++++-'`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`, can be split into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, penalty is `4`.
   - Calculation: `n - 2 * neg = 10 - 2 * 3 = 4` (correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `n = 20`, `s = '+---++++-+++++---++-'`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `a = [1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`, can be split into multiple subarrays with minimal penalty, resulting in `4`.
   - Calculation: `n - 2 * neg = 20 - 2 * 8 = 4` (correct)

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the described strategy. It correctly handles all the test cases.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary provided is accurate. It correctly describes how `func_1` processes each test case by reading an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It calculates and prints the result as `n - 2 * neg` if the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, or if there are more '+' characters than '-' characters. If the string contains only '-' characters, it prints `n`.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
