To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:
We need to distribute coins across `n` possible outcomes such that if any one of these outcomes wins, the total coins received (which is the bet on that outcome multiplied by its multiplier) is strictly greater than the total coins bet across all outcomes.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of outcomes) and a list of multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Core Logic:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers using the function `func_1`.
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier.
   - It calculates `den` as the difference between the LCM and the sum of the elements in `vprod`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`, which are supposed to be the bets for each outcome.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The list `vprod` is constructed such that the sum of `vprod` is less than the LCM because each element in `vprod` is the LCM divided by a multiplier, and the sum of these fractions is less than the LCM.
   - For each outcome `i`, the coins received if it wins would be `k_i * vprod_i = LCM`, which is strictly greater than the sum of `vprod` (since `den > 0`).

### Verification:
- The program correctly calculates the LCM and uses it to derive the bets.
- The condition `den > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the coins received for any winning outcome.
- The program correctly handles the case where no valid distribution exists by checking if `den <= 0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem and handles the edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
