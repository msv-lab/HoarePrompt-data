Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions. This involves understanding how the friendship values change over time as pairs are chosen.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - There are `n` children and `m` pairs of friends with given friendship values.
   - The teacher chooses `k` pairs of children randomly and independently.

2. **Friendship Value Changes:**
   - If a chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - If a chosen pair is not friends, their friendship value remains 0.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\).
   - We need to calculate \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
   - `s` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of expected friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

3. **Processing Friend Pairs:**
   - The program iterates over the `m` friend pairs, adding their friendship values to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program then iterates `k` times, updating `s` in each iteration.
   - The formula used for updating `s` is incorrect. It seems to assume a linear increase in expected friendship values, which is not accurate.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Formula:**
  - The formula used in the program for updating `s` is incorrect. It does not accurately reflect the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
  - The expected value should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the cumulative increase in their friendship values.

- **Modular Arithmetic:**
  - The program uses modular arithmetic correctly for the final output, but the intermediate calculations are incorrect.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program, particularly the incorrect formula for updating the expected sum of friendship values, the program is not correct.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
