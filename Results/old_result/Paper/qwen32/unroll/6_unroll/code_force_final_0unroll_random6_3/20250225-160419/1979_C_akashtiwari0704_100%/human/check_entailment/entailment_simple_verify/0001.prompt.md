You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3

    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins. Each winning outcome has a multiplier `k_i`, and the amount received is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
2. **LCM Calculation**: Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`.
3. **Bet Calculation**: For each outcome, calculate the bet as `prod // k_i` where `prod` is the LCM of the multipliers.
4. **Sum Calculation**: Sum up all the bets.
5. **Validation**: If the sum of the bets is less than the LCM, print the bets; otherwise, print `-1`.

### Correctness Evaluation
The logic in the program seems to be based on the idea that the bets should be such that the total sum of bets is less than the smallest possible return from any winning outcome. However, the program's approach may not always yield a correct solution. Here's why:

- **LCM Usage**: The LCM of the multipliers is used to compute the bets. However, the program does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for each outcome. The condition `if sumo >= prod` is not sufficient to guarantee that the solution is valid for all `k_i`.
- **Bet Calculation**: The program calculates the bets as `prod // k_i`. This does not guarantee that the total sum of bets will be less than the return for each outcome. For example, if all multipliers are the same, the bets will all be the same, and their sum might not be less than the return for any outcome.
- **Output**: The program outputs `-1` if the sum of bets is not less than the LCM, but this condition might not cover all cases where a valid distribution of bets is possible.

### Example
Consider the test case with multipliers `3 3`. The LCM is `3`, and the bets would be `1 1` (i.e., `3 // 3`). The sum of bets is `2`, which is less than the return for any winning outcome (`3 * 1 = 3`). This case is correctly handled. However, consider a case like `2 4`. The LCM is `4`, and the bets would be `2 1`. The sum is `3`, which is less than the return for the second outcome (`4 * 1 = 4`), but not for the first outcome (`2 * 2 = 4`). The correct bets should be something like `1 1`, but the program does not guarantee this.

### Conclusion
The program does not guarantee a correct solution for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
