Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves an array `a` that undergoes a series of operations. There are two types of operations:

1. **Append Operation**: Append an integer `x` to the end of array `a`.
2. **Copy Operation**: Append `x` copies of the current array `a` to the end of `a` itself.

After performing all operations, Jayden has queries asking for the `k`-th element of the final array `a`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: This function takes the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It performs the operations on the array and answers the queries.
- `func_2`: This function reads input from the standard input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

Let's break down `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: An empty list `array` is created to store the elements of the array `a`. Another list `result` is initialized to store the answers to the queries.
2. **Processing Operations**: The function iterates over the list of operations. For each operation:
   - If the operation type is 1 (`op_type == 1`), it appends the given integer `value` to the `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2 (`op_type == 2`), it appends `x` copies of the current `array` to itself. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over the current `array` and appends each element `x` times. However, this approach is inefficient and incorrect for large values of `x` (up to \(10^9\)) because it tries to create a list with a size of up to \(10^{18}\), which is infeasible.
3. **Answering Queries**: For each query `k`, it calculates the `k`-th element of the array by using modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This assumes that the array has been fully constructed, which is not the case due to the inefficiency mentioned above.

### Correctness

The program is incorrect due to the following reasons:
- **Inefficiency**: The program attempts to construct the entire array `a` after each copy operation, which is computationally infeasible for large values of `x` (up to \(10^9\)).
- **Memory Constraints**: The program tries to store an array of size up to \(10^{18}\), which exceeds typical memory limits.
- **Logic Error**: The logic for answering queries assumes that the array has been fully constructed, which is not true due to the inefficiency in handling large copy operations.

### Conclusion

Given the inefficiency and memory constraints, the program is not correct for the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
