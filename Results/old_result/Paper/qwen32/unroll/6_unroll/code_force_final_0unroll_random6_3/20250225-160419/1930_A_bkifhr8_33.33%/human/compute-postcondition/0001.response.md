The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty list `ans_f`. No other variables or their values are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `ans_f`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases. `ans_f` is an empty list.**
