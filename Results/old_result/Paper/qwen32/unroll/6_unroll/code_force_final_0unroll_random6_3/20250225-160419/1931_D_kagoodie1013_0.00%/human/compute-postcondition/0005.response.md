Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and returns the count of pairs `(a_i, a_j)` with `i < j` such that the product of `a_i` and `a_j` is divisible by both `x` and `y`. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.**
