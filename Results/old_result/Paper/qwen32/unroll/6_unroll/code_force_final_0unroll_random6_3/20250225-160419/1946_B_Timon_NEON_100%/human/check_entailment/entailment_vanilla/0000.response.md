Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to perform exactly `k` operations on an array `a` of `n` integers. In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of `a` and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. Our goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` such operations, and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Analysis
The provided code seems to be incomplete and does not fully implement the solution. Let's break down the code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is correctly implemented for the modulo operation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum and its indices. It seems to be an implementation of Kadane's algorithm with some modifications to track the subarray indices.
   - However, the function has some issues:
     - It does not handle the case where all elements are negative correctly.
     - The logic for handling negative numbers within a subarray is flawed.
     - The function does not return the correct maximum subarray sum and indices in all cases.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, but it is incomplete and does not contain any logic.

### Correctness
Given the analysis above, the code is incomplete and contains logical errors, particularly in `func_2`. Therefore, it cannot correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: False**

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Find the maximum contiguous subarray sum (using Kadane's algorithm).
- Determine the optimal way to insert the subarray sums to maximize the array sum after `k` operations.
- Handle edge cases, such as when all elements are negative or when `k` is large.

The current implementation does not address these requirements, so it is incorrect.
