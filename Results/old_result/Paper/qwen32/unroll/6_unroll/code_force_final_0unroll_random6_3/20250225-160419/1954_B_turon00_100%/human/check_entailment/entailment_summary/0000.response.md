### Reasoning:

The provided program and its execution summary do not align with the problem's requirements. The program is designed to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray within `a` that contains all distinct elements of `a`, which is not the task required by the problem.

The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it no longer "beautiful." An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same using the specified operation. The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent this from being possible.

The correct approach involves identifying segments within the array where the elements can be made uniform using the given operation and determining the minimum removals needed to disrupt these segments. The provided program does not implement this logic; instead, it focuses on finding the minimum length of a contiguous subarray with all distinct elements.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It needs to be revised to correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful.
