The code snippet simply initializes a variable `cou` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. The initial state of `arr` and `freq` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `freq` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where each index `j` of `freq` contains the count of how many times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0.**
