### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`

1. **Initialization:**
   - The first element of `row` is set to 1.
   - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2.

2. **Heap Construction:**
   - A min-heap is created with the first `d` elements of `row` along with their indices.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - For each element from index `d` to the end of the row:
     - The loop pops elements from the heap until it finds an element whose index is within the last `d+2` columns.
     - The current element's cost is updated based on the minimum cost found in the heap plus the current cell's cost plus 1.
     - The popped element is re-pushed back into the heap.
     - The new cost for the current cell is also pushed into the heap.

4. **Return:**
   - The function returns the last element of `row`, which is supposed to represent the minimum cost to install supports in that row.

**Key Points:**
- The re-pushing of the popped elements back into the heap is crucial for maintaining the correct structure of the heap.
- The logic for updating the cost of each cell seems correct given the constraints and the problem description.

#### Function `func_2()`

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the grid.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

**Key Points:**
- The logic for summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finding the minimum total cost is correct.

### Evaluation of Annotations

The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points and seem accurate in terms of the intended logic. However, the original assessment suggests that there might be an issue with the heap handling in `func_1`. Let's verify this:

- The `while` loop in `func_1` is designed to find the minimum cost within the last `d+2` columns. The re-pushing of the popped elements ensures that the heap remains valid and contains the correct elements for future calculations.
- The logic for updating the cost of each cell is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

Based on the annotations and the logical flow of the code, the original assessment might be overly cautious. The re-pushing of elements back into the heap in `func_1` is crucial and correctly implemented. The logic for both functions seems consistent with the problem requirements and the provided annotations.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the given implementation and annotations.

**Final: True**
