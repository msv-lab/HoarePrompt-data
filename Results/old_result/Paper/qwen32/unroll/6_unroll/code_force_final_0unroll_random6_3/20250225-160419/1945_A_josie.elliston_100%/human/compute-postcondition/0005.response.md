Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**

Given the conditions, `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, and the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and the value of `universals` is 3 or more. This means that the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` will always result in a number that, when divided by 3, has a remainder that pushes the result up to the next whole number when taking the ceiling.
