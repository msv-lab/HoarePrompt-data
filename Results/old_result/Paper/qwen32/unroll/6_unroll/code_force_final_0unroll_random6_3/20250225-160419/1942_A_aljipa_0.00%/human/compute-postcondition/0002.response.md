To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the given loop and its behavior based on the conditions provided:

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the values of `k` relative to `n`, it sets the list `res` to one of three possible states:
- If `k == n`, `res` is set to a list of `n` ones (`[1] * n`).
- If `k == 1`, `res` is set to a range from `0` to `n-1` (`range(n)`).
- If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, `res` is set to a list containing a single element `-1`.

After setting `res`, the list is printed.

The output state after all iterations is the sequence of all printed lists `res` for each test case.

Given this, the Output State can be described as a series of printed lists, each corresponding to the result of a single test case. The exact output depends on the input values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Since the problem does not provide specific input values for `n` and `k`, the output state will be a general description of what gets printed for each test case based on the conditions given.

Output State: **A series of printed lists where each list corresponds to the result of a test case: a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from `0` to `n-1` if `k == 1`, or a list containing `-1` if `k` is neither `n` nor `1`.**
