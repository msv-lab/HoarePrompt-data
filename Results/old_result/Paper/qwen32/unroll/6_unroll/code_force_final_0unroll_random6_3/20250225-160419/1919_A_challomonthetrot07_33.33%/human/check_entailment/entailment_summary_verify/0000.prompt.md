You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions related to the values of `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing coins from their wallets, with the option to swap wallets before each turn. The player who cannot make a move loses. The program aims to determine the winner based on the initial number of coins in each player's wallet.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program makes decisions based on the values of `a` and `b` (number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets respectively). Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **If `a == b`:** The program outputs "Bob".
2. **If `a == 1`:** The program outputs "Alice".
3. **If `b == 1`:** The program outputs "Bob".
4. **If `a % 2 == 1`:** The program outputs "Bob".
5. **If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`:** The program outputs "Alice".
6. **If `a > b`:** The program outputs "Bob".
7. **Otherwise:** The program outputs "Alice".

Let's check if this logic correctly determines the winner for all possible cases.

### Testing the Program:
We need to check if the program handles all edge cases and typical cases correctly. Here are some test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `a = 1, b = 1`
   - Both players have 1 coin. Alice cannot make a move after her first turn, so Bob wins.
   - Program Output: "Bob" (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:** `a = 1, b = 4`
   - Alice swaps with Bob, now `a = 4, b = 1`. Bob swaps back, now `a = 1, b = 4`. Alice can't swap and removes a coin, now `a = 0, b = 4`. Bob removes a coin, now `a = 0, b = 3`. Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.
   - Program Output: "Alice" (Incorrect)

3. **Test Case 3:** `a = 5, b = 3`
   - Alice swaps with Bob, now `a = 3, b = 5`. Bob swaps back, now `a = 5, b = 3`. Alice removes a coin, now `a = 4, b = 3`. Bob removes a coin, now `a = 4, b = 2`. Alice removes a coin, now `a = 3, b = 2`. Bob removes a coin, now `a = 3, b = 1`. Alice swaps with Bob, now `a = 1, b = 3`. Bob removes a coin, now `a = 1, b = 2`. Alice removes a coin, now `a = 0, b = 2`. Bob removes a coin, now `a = 0, b = 1`. Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.
   - Program Output: "Bob" (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:** `a = 4, b = 5`
   - Alice swaps with Bob, now `a = 5, b = 4`. Bob swaps back, now `a = 4, b = 5`. Alice removes a coin, now `a = 3, b = 5`. Bob removes a coin, now `a = 3, b = 4`. Alice removes a coin, now `a = 2, b = 4`. Bob removes a coin, now `a = 2, b = 3`. Alice removes a coin, now `a = 1, b = 3`. Bob removes a coin, now `a = 1, b = 2`. Alice removes a coin, now `a = 0, b = 2`. Bob removes a coin, now `a = 0, b = 1`. Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.
   - Program Output: "Alice" (Incorrect)

5. **Test Case 5:** `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`
   - Both players have the same number of coins. Alice cannot make a move after her first turn, so Bob wins.
   - Program Output: "Bob" (Correct)

From the test cases above, we can see that the program does not correctly determine the winner for all cases. Specifically, it fails for cases where `a == 1` or `b == 1` and for some other cases where the number of coins are different.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Additional Explanation:
The logic in the program is incorrect for several cases, particularly when `a == 1` or `b == 1` and for some other cases where the number of coins are different. The program needs a more comprehensive approach to determine the winner based on the game rules.
