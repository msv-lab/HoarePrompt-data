The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This means that the variable `n` will be assigned the integer value of the input provided. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and `day` is 'AM'. The string `s` of format "hh:mm" is mentioned for each test case, but it is not affected by the input in this code snippet.

After executing `n = int(input())`, the variable `n` will hold the integer value of the input. The values of `t`, `s`, and `day` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; Each of the t test cases is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", where "hh" is a valid hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23) and "mm" is a valid minute (00 to 59); `day` is 'AM'; `n` is an input integer.**
