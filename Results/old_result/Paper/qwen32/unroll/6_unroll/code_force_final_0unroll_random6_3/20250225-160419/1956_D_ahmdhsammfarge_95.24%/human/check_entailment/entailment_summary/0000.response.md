### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the code and the functions to determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to find a subarray that maximizes a certain sum formula: `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and checks if the calculated sum for the subarray is greater than the current maximum sum (`over_sum`). If it is, it updates the indices `r` and `l` to the current subarray's indices.
   - The purpose is to identify the subarray that, if replaced with its MEX value, would yield the highest possible sum increase.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to append operations to the `ops` list in a specific recursive manner.
   - However, the function does not correctly reflect the logic needed to compute the MEX and replace the subarray. It seems to be appending operations based on the indices `r` and `l` but does not actually perform the replacement or compute the MEX.
   - The recursive calls to `func_2` add a lot of redundant operations and do not contribute to the desired result.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function appends operations to the `ops` list and modifies the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` by replacing it with `n` elements, each equal to `n`.
   - It also calls `func_2`, which as mentioned, does not perform the necessary operations correctly.
   - The check for `min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0` and the subsequent operation do not align with the problem's requirement to compute the MEX and replace the subarray with the MEX value.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic involves finding the subarray with the maximum sum formula using `func_1`, then applying the operations using `func_3` until no more beneficial subarrays are found.
   - The final operations to replace `0` with `1` are not aligned with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the MEX of subarrays and replace them accordingly. The operations generated by the functions do not guarantee that the maximum possible sum is achieved. The recursive calls in `func_2` add unnecessary operations and do not contribute to the correct solution.

### Correctness: **False**
