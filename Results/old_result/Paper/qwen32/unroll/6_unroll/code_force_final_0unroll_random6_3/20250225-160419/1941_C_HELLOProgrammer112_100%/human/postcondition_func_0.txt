The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s`. For each string, it calculates the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie', and subtracts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'mapie'. The result for each test case is printed as an integer.
