The code snippet `n, m, x = func_3()` indicates that the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` will be reassigned to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `m`, and `x` as determined by `func_3()`.

Since the specific values returned by `func_3()` are not given, we can only state the output state in terms of the new values assigned to `n`, `m`, and `x`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.**
