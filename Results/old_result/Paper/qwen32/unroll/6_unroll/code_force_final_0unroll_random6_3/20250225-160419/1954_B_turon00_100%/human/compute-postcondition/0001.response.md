The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute because the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied by the given constraints on `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
