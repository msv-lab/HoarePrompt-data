### Reasoning:
The program is intended to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. A pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

The program uses two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of elements based on their remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the correctness of the program:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to store the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

2. **Processing Each Element**: For each element `num` in the array:
   - It calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - It then increments the count by the values stored in `mod_x_map` for `mod_x` and `mod_y_map` for `mod_y`. This is because, for a current element `num`, any previous element `prev_num` that has a remainder of `-num % x` when divided by `x` will satisfy the first condition (`num + prev_num` is divisible by `x`), and any previous element `prev_num` that has a remainder of `num % y` when divided by `y` will satisfy the second condition (`num - prev_num` is divisible by `y`).
   - It updates `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element's remainders.

3. **Counting Pairs**: The count is incremented for each element by the number of previously seen elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element.

4. **Storing Results**: After processing all elements in the array, the count for that test case is stored in the `results` list.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the counts for all test cases.

The logic in the program correctly implements the conditions for a pair to be beautiful and efficiently counts such pairs using hash maps (dictionaries). There are no apparent logical errors in the program that would lead to incorrect results.
