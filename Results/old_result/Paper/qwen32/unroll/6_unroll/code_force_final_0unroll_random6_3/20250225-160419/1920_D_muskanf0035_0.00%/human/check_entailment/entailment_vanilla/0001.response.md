Let's analyze the provided code step by step with respect to the problem description.

### Problem Summary
1. We have an initially empty array `a`.
2. We perform `n` operations in a specific order:
   - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the end of `a`.
   - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array `a` to the end of `a`.
3. We answer `q` queries, each asking for the `k`-th element of the final array `a`.

### Key Points to Consider
- The array `a` can grow very large due to the Type 2 operation.
- The problem constraints allow the size of the array to be up to \(10^{18}\) elements, which makes it impractical to store the entire array in memory.
- We need to efficiently determine the `k`-th element of the array without constructing the entire array.

### Analysis of the Provided Code

#### Function `func_1`
- This function is responsible for processing the operations and answering the queries.
- It initializes an empty list `array` and iterates over the operations.
- For Type 1 operations, it appends the given integer to `array`.
- For Type 2 operations, it attempts to extend `array` by adding `x` copies of the current `array` to itself. However, this approach is incorrect because:
  - Extending the array in this manner will result in a memory overflow due to the large size constraints.
  - It does not handle the large `x` values efficiently.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `q`, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
- It prints the results returned by `func_1`.

### Correctness Evaluation
- The provided code attempts to construct the entire array, which is not feasible given the constraints.
- The code does not handle the large `x` values in Type 2 operations efficiently.
- The code does not provide a correct solution for the problem, as it will fail to handle large inputs due to memory limitations.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it tries to construct the entire array, which is not feasible given the problem constraints. A correct solution would need to determine the `k`-th element without constructing the entire array, possibly by keeping track of the structure of the array and using mathematical calculations to find the required element.

Correctness: **False**
