Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, and prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
