Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string `s`. The string `s` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either '+' or '-'. There are no constraints on the sum of `n` over all test cases. `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`.**

In natural language: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string `s`. The string `s` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either '+' or '-'. There are no constraints on the sum of `n` over all test cases. The variable `n` is now assigned the value of the integer input.
