To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context and implications of the variables and objects mentioned.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **n**: An integer representing the length of the original array `a` before duplicates were removed.
2. **a**: A sorted list of integers in descending order with duplicates removed.
3. **counter**: An empty `Counter` object, which is used to count the occurrences of elements.
4. **cnt**: An integer initialized to 0.
5. **ans**: A list that is supposed to contain the integers from the original list `a` with duplicates inserted back in the correct positions.

### Analysis:
- The list `a` contains unique elements sorted in descending order.
- The `counter` object is initially empty, indicating that no counts have been recorded yet.
- The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0 and does not seem to be used in the snippet provided.
- The list `ans` is constructed to include duplicates from the original list `a`. However, the process of constructing `ans` is not provided in the snippet, so we can only infer that `ans` should contain all elements from the original list `a` with their respective duplicates.

### Output Determination:
Since the code snippet provided does not show how `ans` is populated, we can only infer that `ans` should contain all elements from the original list `a` with duplicates included. However, without the exact process or the original list `a` with duplicates, we cannot provide the exact numerical output.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
- The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans`.
- `ans` is constructed to contain the integers from the original list `a` with duplicates inserted back in the correct positions.

### Final Output:
Since the exact elements of `ans` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of what it represents.

Output: **the elements of the list `ans` (where `ans` contains the integers from the original list `a` with duplicates inserted back in the correct positions)**
