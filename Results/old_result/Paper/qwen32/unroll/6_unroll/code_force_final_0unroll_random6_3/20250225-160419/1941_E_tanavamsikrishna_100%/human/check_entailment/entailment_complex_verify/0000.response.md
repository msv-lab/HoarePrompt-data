### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
- Each bridge needs supports with specific constraints.
- The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports.

#### Code Analysis:

**Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
- **Objective**: Calculate the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row with a maximum distance `d` between supports.
- **Steps**:
  1. Initialize the first element of `row` to 1.
  2. Increment the next `d-1` elements by 2.
  3. Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to install supports up to a certain column.
  4. For each column from `d` to the end, update the cost based on the minimum cost of the previous valid support.
- **Annotations**:
  - The annotations state that the function modifies `row` by setting the first element to 1 and incrementing the next `d-1` elements by 2.
  - It then updates the remaining elements based on a min-heap data structure.
  - The final element of the modified `row` is returned.

**Function `func_2()`**:
- **Objective**: Read input, calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
- **Steps**:
  1. Read input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  2. Read the grid of depths.
  3. Calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  4. Compute the sum of costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
  5. Print the minimum sum.

**Issues Identified**:
1. **Heap Management in `func_1`**:
   - The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass` is problematic. It pops elements from the heap without using them, which means the heap is being emptied unnecessarily.
   - Correct approach: Pop elements from the heap until the column index is within the valid range (`i - d` to `i`).

2. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The cost calculation `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. The cost should be `row[i] + 1` added to the minimum cost of the previous valid support, not `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
   - Correct cost calculation: `row[i] = e[0] + 1` if `row[i]` is the depth at column `i`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `d` is very small or `k` is equal to `n`.
   - The code does not ensure that the supports are placed correctly according to the problem constraints.

#### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 5 1 1
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```
Expected output: `2` (build the bridge on the first row with supports at columns 1 and 5)

Actual output: Incorrect due to the issues in `func_1`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of installing supports for each row. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**.
