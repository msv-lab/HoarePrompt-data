The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting only of 'A' and 'B'. It then prints 'A' if the string contains more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
