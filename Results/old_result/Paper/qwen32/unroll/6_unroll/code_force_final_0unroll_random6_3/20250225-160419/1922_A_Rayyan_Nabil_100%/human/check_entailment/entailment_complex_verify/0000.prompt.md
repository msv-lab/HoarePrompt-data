You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if there is at least one position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: `n` is the number of characters in the last set of strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are the strings from the last iteration. `a`, `b`, and `c` are the strings from the last iteration. `t` is unchanged. `results` is a list containing the results from each of the `t` iterations.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: n is the number of characters in the last set of strings a, b, and c, which are the strings from the last iteration. a, b, and c are the strings from the last iteration. t is unchanged. results is a list containing the results from each of the t iterations. The elements of results have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20`). It then computes and prints the number of positions at which the corresponding characters in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not.

To correctly solve the problem, for each position `i` in the strings, we need to ensure that:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then we can choose a template character that matches `a[i]` and `b[i]` but does not match `c[i]`.

Here is a counterexample where the given program fails:

Input:
```
1
2
ab
ba
aa
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
```
Explanation:
- For the first position, `a[0] = 'a'` and `b[0] = 'b'`. We can choose 'A' as the template character, which matches `a[0]` and `b[0]` but does not match `c[0]`.
- For the second position, `a[1] = 'b'` and `b[1] = 'a'`. We can choose 'B' as the template character, which matches `a[1]` and `b[1]` but does not match `c[1]`.

The given program would return "NO" for this input because it does not find a single position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
