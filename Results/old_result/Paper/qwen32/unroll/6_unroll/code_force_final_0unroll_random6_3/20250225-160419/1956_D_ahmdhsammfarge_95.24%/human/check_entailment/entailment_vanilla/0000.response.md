Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly performing an operation that replaces a subarray with its MEX (Minimum Excluded Value). The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The operations are constrained to be no more than 500,000.

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
This function is supposed to find the optimal subarray `[i, j]` to replace with its MEX. However, the current implementation does not accurately compute the MEX of the subarray, and it doesn't ensure that the chosen subarray maximizes the sum of the array after the operation. Instead, it calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray and the sums of the parts of the array outside the subarray, which is not the correct approach for finding the MEX or maximizing the sum.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
This function seems to be intended to add operations to a list `ops` recursively, but it doesn't perform any meaningful operations related to maximizing the array sum. It simply adds operations with the same subarray bounds, which does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
This function is supposed to perform the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by replacing it with its MEX. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX operation. Additionally, it adds multiple operations to `ops` recursively, which again does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis above, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of a subarray or to maximize the sum of the array. The functions do not perform the intended operations and instead perform unrelated or incorrect operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
