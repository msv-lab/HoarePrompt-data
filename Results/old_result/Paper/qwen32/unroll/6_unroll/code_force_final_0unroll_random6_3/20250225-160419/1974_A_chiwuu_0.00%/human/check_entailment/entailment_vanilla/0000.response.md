Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Problem Recap:
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid, so it has 15 cells.
- We have `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.
- 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, so `y` 2x2 icons will occupy `4*y` cells.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t = b * 2`: This line calculates the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons, which is `4*y` but mistakenly calculated as `2*y`.
   - `if t % 5 == 0: t = t // 5 else: t = t // 5 + 1`: This line calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. However, since `t` was calculated as `2*y` instead of `4*y`, this calculation is incorrect.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This line calculates the remaining cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons for 1x1 icons. However, since `t` was calculated incorrectly, `t1` will also be incorrect.
   - `if t1 >= a: t = t else: t2 = a - t1`: This line checks if the remaining cells are enough for the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - `if t2 % 15 == 0: t = t + t2 // 15 else: t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`: This line calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons because it mistakenly multiplies `y` by 2 instead of 4. This mistake cascades and affects the entire calculation for the number of screens. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness:** **False**
