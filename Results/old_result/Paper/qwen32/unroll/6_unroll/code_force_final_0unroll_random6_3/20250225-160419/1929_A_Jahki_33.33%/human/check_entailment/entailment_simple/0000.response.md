### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, we should sort the array in ascending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized, thereby maximizing the overall beauty.

The provided program follows this logic correctly:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function. If it is, the beauty is 0 because no rearrangement can increase the beauty.
4. If the array is not sorted, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and if it is, it returns True, and the program prints 0, which is correct. But the function `func_1` is not necessary for the correct execution of the program, as the beauty can be calculated directly by sorting the array and summing the differences, regardless of the initial order of the array. The beauty calculation should always be performed after sorting the array, and the initial check using `func_1` is redundant.

Despite this redundancy, the program still produces the correct output for the given test cases because the beauty calculation is correctly implemented after sorting the array.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The initial check using `func_1` is not necessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.
