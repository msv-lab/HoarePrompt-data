To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_2(r, l, ops)`. Since the function `func_2` is not provided, I will assume that `func_2` performs some operations based on the parameters `r`, `l`, and `ops`. However, without the exact implementation of `func_2`, I can't determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. 

Given the initial state and the fact that `func_2` is called with `r`, `l`, and `ops`, we can infer that the function might modify `ops` or perform some other operations based on the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`. Since the exact behavior of `func_2` is not specified, I will assume that the function does not modify `r`, `l`, or `lst` directly unless specified otherwise.

The only change we know for sure is that `ops` now contains two additional elements: `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, r + 1]`. The condition about the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` being 0 is identified but does not affect the variables unless `func_2` uses this condition to modify something.

Thus, the output state will reflect the change in `ops` and the condition being identified, but without further details about `func_2`, we can't determine any other changes.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that now contains an additional element [r + 1, l + 1] and [r + 1, r + 1]. The condition that the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0 has been identified.**
