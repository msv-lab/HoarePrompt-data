To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure that the condition `i <= j` is true right before the loop starts. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is `n - 1`, let's analyze the condition:

- The condition `i <= j` will be true as long as `0 <= n - 1`.
- This inequality simplifies to `n >= 1`, meaning the list `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given that `n` is defined as the length of the list `arr`, the only requirement we need to ensure is that `arr` has at least one element. Since `n` is the length of `arr`, and `j` is initialized to `n - 1`, the initial state already satisfies the condition `i <= j` as long as `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to the state of `i` and `j` for the loop to execute the first time, as long as `arr` has at least one element. 

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `n` is the length of the list `arr` and `n` must be at least 1; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`**
