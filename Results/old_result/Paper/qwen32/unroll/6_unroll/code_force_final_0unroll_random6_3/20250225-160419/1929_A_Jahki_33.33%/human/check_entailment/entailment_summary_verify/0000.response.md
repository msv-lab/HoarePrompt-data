### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
- **Beauty Calculation**: Sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
- **Input**:
  - Number of test cases \(t\).
  - For each test case:
    - Length of array \(n\).
    - Elements of the array \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).
- **Output**: Maximum beauty for each test case.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, sorts the array for each test case, and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reads the length of the array and the array elements.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorts the array in ascending order.

3. **Calculating Beauty**:
   - Initializes `beauty` to 0.
   - Iterates over the sorted array and adds the difference between consecutive elements to `beauty`.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

5. **Condition to Print 0**:
   - Uses `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the beauty as described.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Condition to Print 0**:
   - The condition to print 0 is incorrect. The program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using `func_1`. However, the beauty can still be maximized even if the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order. The beauty calculation should always be performed, and the result should be printed.
   - The `func_1` function is unnecessary and incorrect for determining whether to print 0 or the calculated beauty.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` checks if the list `a` of integers is strictly increasing. It returns `True` if the list is strictly increasing, meaning each element is greater than the previous one, and `False` otherwise.

#### Correctness:
The program incorrectly uses `func_1` to decide whether to print 0 or the calculated beauty. The beauty should always be calculated and printed regardless of the initial order of the array. The `func_1` function should be removed, and the beauty calculation should be performed for every test case.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
2
3
1 3 2
3
2 1 3
```
- For the first test case, the array `[1, 3, 2]` is not sorted, but the beauty can still be calculated as `2` by sorting it to `[1, 2, 3]`.
- For the second test case, the array `[2, 1, 3]` is not sorted, but the beauty can be calculated as `2` by sorting it to `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The program will incorrectly print `0` for the first test case because `func_1` returns `False`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program incorrectly uses a condition to print 0 based on whether the array is sorted, which is not necessary. The beauty should always be calculated and printed. The `func_1` function should be removed, and the beauty calculation should be performed for every test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
