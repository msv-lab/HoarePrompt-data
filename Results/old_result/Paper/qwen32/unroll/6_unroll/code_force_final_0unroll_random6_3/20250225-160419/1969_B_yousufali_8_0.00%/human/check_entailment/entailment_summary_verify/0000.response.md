### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string to sort it in non-descending order.
- The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
- We need to minimize the total cost of these operations.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads a line from the input and converts it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This is incorrect because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers separated by spaces.
  - **Logic**: The function counts the number of '1's encountered (`n`) and whenever it encounters a '0' after '1's, it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`). This logic does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the string.
  
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function reads the number of test cases (`t`) and calls `func_1` for each test case. The function summary correctly describes this behavior.

#### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The input is a binary string, not a list of integers. The function `func_1` should read a string and process it accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost. It simply adds `n + 1` for each '0' encountered after '1's, which does not account for the optimal cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example `101011`:
- The program would process this string as follows:
  - It encounters the first '1', increments `n` to 1.
  - It encounters the second character '0', adds `n + 1` (which is 2) to `ans`.
  - It encounters the third character '1', increments `n` to 2.
  - It encounters the fourth character '0', adds `n + 1` (which is 3) to `ans`.
  - It encounters the fifth character '1', increments `n` to 3.
  - It encounters the sixth character '1', increments `n` to 4.
  - The final value of `ans` would be 2 + 3 = 5, which is incorrect.

- The correct minimum cost to sort `101011` is 5, but the steps and logic used by the program are not optimal and do not correctly calculate this cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The input handling is incorrect, and the logic for calculating the cost is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
