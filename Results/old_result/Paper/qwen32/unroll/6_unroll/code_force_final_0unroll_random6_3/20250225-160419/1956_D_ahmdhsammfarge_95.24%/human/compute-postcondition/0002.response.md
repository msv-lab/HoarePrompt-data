The code snippet `ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])` adds a new element `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and the condition that the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0 still holds. The only change is that `ops` now contains one additional element, which is `[r + 1, l + 1]`.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers; ops now contains an additional element [r + 1, l + 1]. The minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0.**
