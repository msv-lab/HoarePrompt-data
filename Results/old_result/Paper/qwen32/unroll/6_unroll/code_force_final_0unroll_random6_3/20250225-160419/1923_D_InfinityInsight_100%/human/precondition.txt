The function `bin_search` is expected to have parameters `a` and `x` where `a` is a list of integers and `x` is an integer. However, based on the problem description, the function definition does not match the problem's requirements. The correct function should handle multiple test cases, each with a list of slime sizes. Thus, the precondition for the correct function should be: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), for each test case `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of the slimes (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
