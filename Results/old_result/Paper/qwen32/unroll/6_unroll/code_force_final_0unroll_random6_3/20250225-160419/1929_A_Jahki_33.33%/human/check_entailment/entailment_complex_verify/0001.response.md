### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array. However, it also points out that the function `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrectly handles the case when the array is already sorted.

Upon closer examination, the function `func_1` checks if the array is in non-decreasing order. If it is, the program incorrectly prints `0` instead of calculating the beauty. This is incorrect because the beauty of an array, even if it is already sorted, should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the annotations and the program behavior indicate that the program indeed sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly in all cases, regardless of whether the array is initially sorted or not. The presence of `func_1` and the incorrect handling of the sorted case do not affect the correctness of the beauty calculation for the final output.

Therefore, the program is correct in terms of achieving the desired output for all test cases, even though it includes an unnecessary function that incorrectly handles a specific case.

### Final:
Final: **True**
