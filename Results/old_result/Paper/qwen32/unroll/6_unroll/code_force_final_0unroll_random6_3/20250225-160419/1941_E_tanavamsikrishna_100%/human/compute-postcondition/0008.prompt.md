You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of rows, m is a positive integer representing the number of columns such that m >= 3, k is a positive integer representing the number of bridges such that 1 <= k <= n, d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= d <= m.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: - The `total_costs` list will contain sums of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
    #   - The number of elements in `total_costs` will be `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which is equivalent to `n - (k - 1)` because `len(costs) == n`.
    #
    #The final output state will be:
    #
    #Output State:
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns such that `m >= 3`, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges such that `1 <= k <= n`, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that `1 <= d <= m`. The function returns a configuration of bridges based on these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
