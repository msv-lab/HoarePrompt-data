Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The program simply checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and then prints "bob" or "alice" respectively. However, the game's outcome depends on a more complex strategy based on the number of coins in each wallet and the optimal moves by both players.

The program does not account for the optimal play strategy where both players make the best possible moves to win. Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Bob
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 2 coins.
- Alice can choose to swap or not. If she swaps, she gets 2 coins and Bob gets 2 coins.
- Alice can then remove 1 coin, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins.
- Bob can choose to swap or not. If he swaps, he gets 1 coin and Alice gets 2 coins.
- Bob removes 1 coin, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 2 coins.
- Alice removes 1 coin, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 0 coins.
- Alice removes 1 coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 0 coins.
- Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

However, the provided program will output "alice" for this input because `2 + 2` is even, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on optimal play.
