### Reasoning:
The program is structured to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a series of operations and queries. Let's break down the key components and verify if they meet the problem description:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads `n` operations and `q` queries.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the operations:
     - For each operation of type 1, it appends the given integer `x` to the array.
     - For each operation of type 2, it appends `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.
   - However, there is a mistake in the implementation of the operation type 2. Instead of appending `x` copies of the current array, it appends the current array to itself once (`array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`). This means the array is duplicated, not expanded by `x` copies.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - After processing all operations, the function `func_1` handles the queries by finding the `k`-th element in the array (considering 1-based indexing).
   - It uses modulo operation to handle cases where `k` is larger than the length of the array, which is a valid approach.

### Correctness:
The provided code does not correctly implement the operation type 2 as described in the problem statement. The operation type 2 should append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array, but the code only appends the array to itself once. This discrepancy means that the array does not grow as expected, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Conclusion:
Given the issue with the implementation of operation type 2, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
