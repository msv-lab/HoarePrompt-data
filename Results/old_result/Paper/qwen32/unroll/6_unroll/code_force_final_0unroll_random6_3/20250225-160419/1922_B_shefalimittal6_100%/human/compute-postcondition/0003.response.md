The value of `t` is assigned the integer value of the string at index `idx` in the `data` list. Since `idx` is 0, `t` is now the integer value of `data[0]`. The values of `n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The other conditions and constraints on `t`, `n`, and the list of integers still hold.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n; `data` is a list of strings representing the split input; `idx` is 0.**
