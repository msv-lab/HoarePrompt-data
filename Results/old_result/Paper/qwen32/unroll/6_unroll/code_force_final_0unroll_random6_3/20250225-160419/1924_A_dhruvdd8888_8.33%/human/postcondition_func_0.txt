The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if there are at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters in the string `s`. If such sequences exist, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and then, for each missing sequence, it prints a constructed string that includes the last characters of found sequences, a missing character from the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and padding with 'a' to meet the length requirement of `n`.
