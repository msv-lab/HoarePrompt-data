The provided loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints one of three strings: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. This loop does not modify the variables `t`, `n`, or any other variables outside of its body. Therefore, after the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, the state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `n` is an input integer.**
