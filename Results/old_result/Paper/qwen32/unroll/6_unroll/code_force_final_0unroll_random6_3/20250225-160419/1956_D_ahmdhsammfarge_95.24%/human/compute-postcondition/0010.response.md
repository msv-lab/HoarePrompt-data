Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r` and `l` which are integers representing a range in the list `lst`, and `lst` which is a list of integers. It also accepts `ops` which is a list that stores operations as lists of two integers. The function returns the list `lst` where the sublist from index `r` to `l` has been replaced with a list containing `n` elements, each equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of the sublist (`l - r + 1`).**
