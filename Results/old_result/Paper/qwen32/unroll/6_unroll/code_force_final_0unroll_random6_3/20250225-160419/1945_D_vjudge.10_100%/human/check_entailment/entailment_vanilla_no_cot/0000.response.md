Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be within the first `m` positions in line, but the logic within the function is flawed.

Here are the issues with the provided code:
1. The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is correct. However, it is not being updated properly within the loop.
2. The loop iterates backward through the list but does not correctly account for the cost of bribing people to move Kirill forward.
3. The variable `x` is supposed to accumulate the cost of bribes, but it is not being used in a way that correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach the first `m` positions.

To correctly solve the problem, Kirill needs to consider the minimum cost to bribe people to move forward to each position up to `m`. A better approach would involve using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the cost array with infinity
    cost = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    cost[n] = 0  # Kirill starts at position n+1 (end of the line)
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to move Kirill to each position
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        cost[i] = cost[i + 1] + a[i]  # Cost to bribe the person at position i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            cost[j] = min(cost[j], cost[i] + b[j])  # Cost to bribe people between i and j
    
    # Find the minimum cost to be within the first m positions
    result = min(cost[:m])
    print(result)
```

This corrected version uses a cost array to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position and ensures that Kirill can move to any position `j` from position `i` with the minimum cost.
