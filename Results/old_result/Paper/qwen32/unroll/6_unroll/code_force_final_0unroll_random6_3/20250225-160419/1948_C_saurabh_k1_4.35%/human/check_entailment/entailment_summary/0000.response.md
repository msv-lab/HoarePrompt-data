Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the rules described in the problem statement. The logic implemented in the program only checks if the second last character of the second row string is '<'. If it is, the program outputs 'No'; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'. This logic does not account for the robot's movements or the arrows in the grid, and it does not follow the two-step movement rules (first moving in any direction and then moving along the arrow).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the robot's movements according to the rules given:
1. The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. Each second, the robot first moves left, right, down, or up (without going outside the grid).
3. Then, the robot moves according to the arrow in the cell it has moved to.

The provided program does not simulate these movements and does not check if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the grid configuration.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
