You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cost Calculation**: The cost to move a 1 to the right of a 0 is the length of the substring that includes the 1 and all preceding 0s.
2. **Strategy**: Whenever we encounter a 0 after one or more 1s, we need to shift the substring containing these 1s and the 0 to the right of the 0s. The cost of each such shift is the number of 1s before the 0 plus one (the 0 itself).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string, counts the number of 1s encountered, and calculates the cost whenever a 0 is encountered after one or more 1s.
- `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` is incorrectly using `input().split()`, which splits the input based on whitespace. For a binary string, we should just read the string directly using `input()` and then process it.
2. **Conversion to List of Integers**: The function `func_1()` converts the input string to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This is incorrect for a single string input. It should be `list(input())` to convert the string into a list of characters.
3. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost is correct. When a 0 is encountered after one or more 1s, the cost is incremented by the number of 1s seen so far plus one.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(input().strip())  # Read the binary string and convert to list of characters
    n = 0  # Counter for number of 1s
    ans = 0  # Total cost
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':  # If the character is '1'
            n += 1
        elif s[i] == '0' and n != 0:  # If the character is '0' and there were 1s before it
            ans += n + 1  # Add the cost of moving these 1s to the right
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()  # Process each test case

# Call the main function to handle input and output
func_2()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to improper input handling and conversion. After correcting these issues, the logic for calculating the cost is correct.
