Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k` and then divides this LCM by each `k[i]` to get a set of bets `c`. It then normalizes these bets by their greatest common divisor (GCD) and checks if their sum is less than the normalized LCM. If the sum is not less, it outputs `-1`.

However, the logic is flawed because simply normalizing the bets by their GCD does not guarantee that the sum of the bets will be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The normalization step is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.

The correct approach would be to find a set of bets such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. One way to do this is to set each bet `x[i]` to `1` for all `i` except one, and adjust the remaining bet to ensure the condition is met. For example, if there are `n` outcomes with multipliers `k1, k2, ..., kn`, we can set `x1 = 1, x2 = 1, ..., xn-1 = 1`, and `xn = min(k1, k2, ..., kn-1) - 1`. However, this approach needs to be adjusted to ensure it works for all cases, especially when all `k` values are the same.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def find_bets(k):
    n = len(k)
    total_sum = sum(k) - max(k)
    if total_sum < 1:
        return -1
    bets = [1] * n
    bets[k.index(max(k))] = total_sum
    return bets

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    bets = find_bets(k)
    if bets == -1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
```

This version calculates the total sum of `k` values minus the maximum `k` value, and assigns this sum to the bet for the outcome with the maximum multiplier, ensuring that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the amount received for the winning outcome with the maximum multiplier. If no such distribution is possible (which is rare given the constraints), it returns `-1`.
