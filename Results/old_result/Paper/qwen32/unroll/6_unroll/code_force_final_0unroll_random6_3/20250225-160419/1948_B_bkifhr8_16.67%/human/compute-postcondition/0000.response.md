Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. `sorted_lst` is a new list containing the same integers as `lst`, but sorted in ascending order.**

Natural Language: The original list `lst` remains unchanged. A new list `sorted_lst` is created, which contains the same integers as `lst` but arranged in ascending order. The preconditions regarding the values and length of `lst` still hold.
