You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes two integers `x` and `y` provided as input, where each integer consists only of digits from 1 to 9. It rearranges the digits of these numbers such that in the first half of each number, the larger digits from the corresponding positions of the original numbers are placed, and in the second half, the smaller digits are placed. It then prints the rearranged first number followed by the rearranged second number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers by swapping their digits optimally. The code currently swaps the digits in the first half of the numbers to make the first number as large as possible and the second number as small as possible, and vice versa for the second half. This strategy does not necessarily maximize the product of the two numbers.

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
1
12
21
```

Expected Output:
```
22
11
```

The optimal solution is to swap the digits so that both numbers become 21 and 12, or vice versa, resulting in a product of 252. However, the given program will output:
```
21
12
```
or
```
12
21
```
which does not maximize the product.

To correctly solve this problem, a more optimal strategy is needed, such as sorting the digits of both numbers and then greedily pairing the largest available digits from one number with the smallest available digits from the other number to maximize the product.
