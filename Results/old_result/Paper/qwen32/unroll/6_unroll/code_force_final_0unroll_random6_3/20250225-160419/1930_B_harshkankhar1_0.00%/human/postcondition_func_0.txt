The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation `p`. For each test case, it creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices of this list, and prints the modified list.
