### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The final sum should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's break down the program and its correctness:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `k` (number of operations).
   - It then reads the array `a` consisting of `n` integers.

2. **Finding the Maximum Segment:**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in `a`. This is a classic problem that can be solved using Kadane's algorithm.
   - The implementation of `func_2` seems incorrect. It doesn't properly implement Kadane's algorithm, and the logic for maintaining `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. Specifically, the way the segments are being updated and compared doesn't ensure that the maximum sum subarray is correctly identified.
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to return the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, but the current implementation does not guarantee that.

3. **Calculating the Final Answer:**
   - Once the maximum segment is found, the program calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - This formula seems to be based on the assumption that the maximum sum subarray can be repeatedly added to the array, but the implementation of `func_2` does not correctly find this maximum sum subarray.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly performs the modulo operation on the final answer to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_2`, which does not correctly find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. This leads to incorrect calculations of the final answer.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
