Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In simple terms, the variable `T` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`) remain unchanged and still hold their initial descriptions.
