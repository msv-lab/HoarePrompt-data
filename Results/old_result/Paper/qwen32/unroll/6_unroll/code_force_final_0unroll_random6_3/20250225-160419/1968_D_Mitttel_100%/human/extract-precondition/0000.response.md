Precondition: **a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, p is a list of n integers representing a permutation of length n where each integer is between 1 and n, s is a tuple containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= k <= 10^9.**
