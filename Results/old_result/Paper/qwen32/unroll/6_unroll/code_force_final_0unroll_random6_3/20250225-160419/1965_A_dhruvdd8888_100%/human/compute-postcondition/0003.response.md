The code snippet converts each element in the set `nums` to an integer, sorts these integers, and then assigns the sorted list back to `nums`. The other variables (`N`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain as described in the initial state; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the unique strings in the initial `nums` set.**
