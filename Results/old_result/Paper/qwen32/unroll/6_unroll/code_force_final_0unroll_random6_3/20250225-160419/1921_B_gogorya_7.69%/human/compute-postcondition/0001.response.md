In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `n`, `s`, and `f` are not directly involved in controlling the execution of this loop; they are likely used within the loop body, which is omitted in this case.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1. The variables `n`, `s`, and `f` do not need to be adjusted to control the execution of this specific loop, as they are not part of the loop's control condition.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.** 

However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to specify that `t` must be at least 1:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `t` must be at least 1.**
