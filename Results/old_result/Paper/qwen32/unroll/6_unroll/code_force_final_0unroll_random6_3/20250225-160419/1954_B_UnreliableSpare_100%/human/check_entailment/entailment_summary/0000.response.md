### Reasoning:

The program's objective is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. According to the problem statement, an array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1\)) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. If not, it calculates the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements and outputs that length as the answer.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Check if all elements are the same:**
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to determine if all elements in the array are the same. It iterates through the array and sets `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are different.
   - If `flag` remains `True`, it means all elements are the same, and the program outputs `-1`.

2. **Find the shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements:**
   - If the array is not entirely composed of the same element, the program then finds the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are equal.
   - It initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the count of the previous sequence.
   - Finally, it ensures the last sequence is considered by updating `ans` one more time after the loop.

3. **Output the result:**
   - If all elements are the same, it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described above. It accurately identifies whether the array is entirely composed of the same element and, if not, finds the shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements. This shortest sequence represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
