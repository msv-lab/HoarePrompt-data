The code snippet creates a list `vis` of length `n`, where each element is initialized to `0`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `p`, `s`, `mx`, or `cur`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n`, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`) where 1 <= `P_B`, `P_S` <= `n`, 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= `k` <= 10^9, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
