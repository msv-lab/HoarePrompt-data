Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string.
- `n` is 0.
- `ans` is 9.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(ans)
```

We need to determine the value of `ans` based on the initial state provided. According to the initial state, `ans` is explicitly given as 9.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is 9.

Output: **9**
