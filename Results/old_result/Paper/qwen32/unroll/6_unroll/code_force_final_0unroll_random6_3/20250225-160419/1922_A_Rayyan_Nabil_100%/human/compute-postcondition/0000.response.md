The code provided assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, inclusive, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The code does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The only change is the introduction of the variable `t`, which takes the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer.**
