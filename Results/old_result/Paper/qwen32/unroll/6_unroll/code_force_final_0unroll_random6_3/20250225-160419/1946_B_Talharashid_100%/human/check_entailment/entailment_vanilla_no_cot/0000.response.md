Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations is flawed. The program calculates the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) and then uses it in a way that does not maximize the final array sum after `k` operations.

The correct approach should be to calculate the total sum of the array and then, if the total sum is positive, add the maximum subarray sum multiplied by `k` to the total sum. This is because inserting the maximum subarray sum repeatedly will maximize the final sum. If the total sum is negative, the best strategy is to add zeros (by inserting empty subarrays), which means the final sum will be the total sum itself.

Here is the corrected logic:

1. Calculate the total sum of the array.
2. If the total sum is non-negative, the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is the total sum plus the maximum subarray sum multiplied by `k`.
3. If the total sum is negative, the maximum possible sum is the total sum itself (since adding zeros does not change the sum).

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(l)
        
        # Calculate the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        max_subarray_sum = 0
        current_sum = 0
        for ele in l:
            current_sum = max(ele, current_sum + ele)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, current_sum)
        
        # If total_sum is non-negative, we can benefit from adding max_subarray_sum k times
        if total_sum >= 0:
            result = (total_sum + max_subarray_sum * k) % MOD
        else:
            # If total_sum is negative, the best we can do is not add anything (i.e., total_sum)
            result = total_sum % MOD
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected code should produce the correct output for the given problem.
