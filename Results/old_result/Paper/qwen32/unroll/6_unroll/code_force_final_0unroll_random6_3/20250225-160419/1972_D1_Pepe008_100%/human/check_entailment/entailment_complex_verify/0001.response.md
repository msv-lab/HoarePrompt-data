### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it attempts to compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a specific formula and logic.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Calculating the Number of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - It checks if \(x\) is greater than 0, and if so, adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it increments `suma` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at various points:
- `T` is the number of test cases.
- `t` is the current test case index.
- `info` holds the string representation of \(n\) and \(m\).
- `a` and `b` are the integer values of \(n\) and \(m\).
- `suma` accumulates the count of valid pairs.
- `i` is the current value of \(b\).
- `x` is a calculated value based on the formula.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic Error:**
   - The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the conditions checked do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly addressed.

2. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not explained or justified by the problem statement.
   - There is no clear explanation of how the program ensures that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.
- For each pair, checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program's logic and the lack of alignment with the problem statement, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
