Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books and the number of pages in each book.
3. It sorts the list of books in descending order based on the number of pages.
4. Since Alice reads the book with the highest number of pages in each pile, the two books with the highest number of pages in the sorted list will be the ones she reads.
5. The program then prints the sum of the pages of these two books.

This approach ensures that Alice reads the maximum possible number of pages by always choosing the two books with the most pages. Therefore, the program is correct.
