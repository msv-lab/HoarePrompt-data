Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of the string. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.**
