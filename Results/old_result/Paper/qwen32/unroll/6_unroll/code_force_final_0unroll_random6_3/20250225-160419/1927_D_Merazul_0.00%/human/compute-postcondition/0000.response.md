The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component into an integer. This function is typically used to handle multiple integer inputs in a single line efficiently.

Given the initial state, the code does not modify any existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`). Instead, it introduces a new function `R` that can be used later to parse input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component into an integer.**
