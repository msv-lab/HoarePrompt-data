### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation**:
   - The LCM of the multipliers is calculated. This is done to ensure that the bets can be evenly distributed in a way that satisfies the condition for all multipliers.

2. **Modified Bets Calculation**:
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, the bet `x_i` is calculated as `prod // k_i` where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers. This ensures that if the i-th outcome is winning, the returned amount `k_i * x_i` is equal to `prod`, which is greater than the total sum of all bets `sumo`.

3. **Sum of Bets Check**:
   - The sum of all calculated bets (`sumo`) is compared with `prod`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that you come out ahead in every winning outcome, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - If `sumo` is less than `prod`, the program outputs the calculated bets.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach leverages the properties of LCM to ensure that the returned amount for any winning outcome is strictly greater than the total sum of bets. This is because for any winning outcome `i`, the returned amount is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`, which is indeed greater than `sumo` (the sum of all `prod // k_i` for all `i`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where it's impossible to distribute the coins to come out ahead (e.g., when all multipliers are the same and the sum of the bets would equal the returned amount).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as per the provided description and handles the edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
