The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string s. The second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-".
