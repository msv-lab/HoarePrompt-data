Let's analyze the given code to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Mechanics**: Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them (Bob). The game ends when `a` is empty.
2. **Objective**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
3. **MEX**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

### Strategy:
- Alice will aim to include as many low numbers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- Bob will aim to prevent Alice from including certain numbers to minimize the MEX.

### Optimal Play:
- If a number `i` appears an even number of times, Alice can always ensure that she gets the last occurrence of `i` (if she plays optimally).
- If a number `i` appears an odd number of times, Bob can ensure that he gets the last occurrence of `i` (if he plays optimally).

The key observation is that the MEX will be the smallest number `i` such that:
- If `i` appears an even number of times in `a`, Alice can append it to `c`.
- If `i` appears an odd number of times in `a`, Bob will ensure it is not in `c`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` to find the smallest number that meets the criteria for being the MEX.

### Code Logic:
1. **Counter Creation**: `mpp = Counter(arr)` counts the occurrences of each number in `arr`.
2. **Finding MEX**:
   - The code iterates through numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If a number `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks (this means `i` does not appear in `arr` at all, so it is the MEX).
   - If `i` appears exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks (this means `i` appears an odd number of times, and since `first` is `True`, it means this is the first odd occurrence, making `i` the MEX).
   - If `i` appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not correctly handle the case where `i` appears an even number of times. It should only consider the first odd occurrence.
- The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The MEX should be the smallest `i` such that:
  - If `i` appears an even number of times, Alice can append it.
  - If `i` appears an odd number of times, it should be skipped unless it is the smallest number that meets the criteria.

### Correct Approach:
- Iterate through numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each number `i`, check if it appears an even number of times. If so, it can be part of `c`.
- The first number `i` that appears an odd number of times and is not included in `c` will be the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
