To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop for each test case based on the provided code.

The loop processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`, calculates the absolute difference `k = abs(n - m)`, and then determines the output based on specific conditions:

1. If `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`), it prints `k`.
2. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1.
3. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2.
4. Otherwise, it calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and prints the difference between `k` and this highest power of 2.

The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are local to each iteration of the loop and do not affect the global state outside the loop. The only variable that persists across iterations is `t`, which is the number of test cases and remains unchanged.

The output state will consist of `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

Given the initial state of `t` test cases, the output state after the loop will be a series of `t` outputs, one for each test case, determined by the conditions outlined above.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the result of the corresponding test case based on the provided conditions.**
