To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case. The loop reads pairs of integers `a` and `b` and prints the result based on the given conditions. Since the loop does not modify `T` or `t`, the output state will only reflect the results of the print statements for each test case.

The output state will consist of a series of strings ('Alice' or 'Bob') printed for each test case, corresponding to the conditions met by the pairs `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are integers.

The output state will be the sequence of printed results for each test case.

Output State: **the sequence of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed for each test case based on the values of `a` and `b`.**

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` for each test case are not provided, we cannot specify the exact sequence of 'Alice' or 'Bob'. However, the format of the output state will be a list of these strings corresponding to each test case.

If we hypothetically had specific values for `a` and `b` for each test case, we could determine the exact sequence. For example, if the input was:
```
3
2 3
1 2
4 4
```
The output state would be:
Output State: **Alice Bob Bob**

But without specific values, the output state can only be described in terms of the sequence of results for each test case. Therefore, the most accurate description in the given format is:

Output State: **the sequence of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed for each test case based on the values of `a` and `b`.**
