Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum final score by optimally performing the n moves. The main issue lies in the way the program handles the removal of elements from the list. The code attempts to remove elements using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which is incorrect and will lead to errors or incorrect results.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements**: The code uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements from the list. This is problematic because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always evaluate to `0` and `2` respectively, regardless of the loop iteration. This means the code will always try to remove the first and third elements of the list, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Logic for Selecting Minimum Pairs**: The code should sort the list and then pair the smallest elements together to maximize the score. However, the current logic does not sort the list and does not correctly handle the selection and removal of pairs.

3. **Handling of List Length**: The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not correctly handling the pairing logic. The code should always pair the smallest two elements and remove them from the list until all elements are processed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to pair the smallest elements together
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]  # Add the smaller of each pair to the score
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version, the list is sorted, and then the program iterates through the list in steps of 2, adding the smaller element of each pair to the score. This ensures that the maximum score is achieved by always pairing the smallest available elements.
