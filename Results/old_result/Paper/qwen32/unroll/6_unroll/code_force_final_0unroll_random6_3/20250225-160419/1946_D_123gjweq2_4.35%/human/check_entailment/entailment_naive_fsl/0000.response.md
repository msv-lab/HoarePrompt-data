Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calls `find_max` with a fixed bit value of 31. However, the problem description does not specify that the maximum number of bits to consider is always 31. The value of `x` can be any number less than \(2^{30}\), meaning the maximum number of bits to consider should be based on the highest bit position in `x`, not a fixed 31.

2. **Function `find_max`**: The logic inside this function is intended to recursively split the array based on the current bit position and check if the XOR of segments can be combined within the constraint `x`. However, there are several issues:
   - The `xor` variable is used to accumulate the XOR of elements in the current segment. When a segment's XOR does not have the current bit set, it is added to `new_arr`, and `xor` is reset to 0. This is correct.
   - The variable `thing1` is used to handle the case when the final `xor` has the current bit set. However, the logic for `thing1` is incorrect. It should recursively call `find_max` with the remaining elements and the next bit position, but it incorrectly returns -1 if the final `xor` has the current bit set.
   - The final return statement incorrectly compares the results of two recursive calls without considering the constraint `x`. It should only return the maximum of the two results if the combined result does not exceed `x`.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided code will likely return an incorrect result because the fixed bit value and incorrect handling of the `xor` value will lead to incorrect segment splits and results.

To fix the code, the following changes are needed:
- Determine the maximum bit position in `x` dynamically.
- Correctly handle the case when the final `xor` has the current bit set.
- Ensure the combined result does not exceed `x` when comparing results of recursive calls. 

Since the current implementation does not meet these requirements, the code is incorrect.
