Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX score, respectively. The code seems to be attempting to find the MEX of the array `c` by counting the frequency of each element in the input array `arr`. However, it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not account for their optimal moves.

Let's analyze the code in more detail:

1. **Frequency Counting**: The code counts the frequency of each element in the input array `arr` and then tries to find the first element that appears less than twice. This logic is not aligned with the game rules where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.

2. **Game Simulation**: The code does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. The optimal strategy involves Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it. The current code does not handle this interaction.

3. **Output**: The code outputs the first element that appears less than twice in the frequency count. This is not the correct approach to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns and calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`. Here is a brief outline of the correct approach:

1. **Count Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.

2. **Simulate the Game**:
   - Alice should try to add elements to `c` in such a way that the MEX is maximized.
   - Bob should try to add elements to `c` in such a way that the MEX is minimized.

3. **Calculate MEX**: After simulating the game, calculate the MEX of the array `c`.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided code does not implement the correct logic to simulate the game and calculate the MEX optimally. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input**:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1
```

**Explanation**:
- Alice can pick 3, then Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, and Bob picks 1. The final array `c` is [3, 0, 2, 1], and the MEX is 1.

The provided code does not handle this case correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
