The code snippet only initializes a new variable `nw` to the value `True`. The values of `nums` and `ls` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`nums` is a list of 1s with the same length as the initial `nums`, `ls` is the sum of the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True`.**
