### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and annotations, and compare them with the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Breakdown

1. **Objective:** Build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a river grid to minimize the total cost of installing supports. Each bridge spans from the first column (river bank) to the last column (river bank) with supports placed at specific positions according to the following rules:
   - A support must be placed in the first and last columns.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support at position `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Constraints:**
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`
   - `3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5`
   - `1 ≤ d ≤ m`
   - `0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6`
   - `a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0` for all `i`.

3. **Approach:**
   - For each row, determine the minimum cost to install supports such that the constraints are met.
   - Sum the costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.

#### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`

- **Purpose:** Calculate the minimum cost to install supports in a single row.
- **Implementation:**
  - The function sets the first element of `row` to 1 and increments the next `d-1` elements by 2.
  - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of supports within the last `d+2` columns.
  - For each subsequent column, it finds the minimum cost of a support within the last `d+2` columns, adds the current cell's cost plus 1, and updates the heap.

- **Annotations:**
  - The annotations describe the state of `row` and `min_heap` at various points.
  - The annotations suggest that the function is intended to calculate the minimum cost for placing supports in a row with the given constraints.

- **Correctness Consideration:**
  - The function's logic seems to be attempting to find the minimum cost path for supports in a single row.
  - The use of a min-heap to track the minimum cost within the last `d+2` columns seems appropriate.
  - However, the `while` loop that pops elements from the heap until an element within the last `d+2` columns is found does not re-push the popped elements back into the heap. This could lead to incorrect results because the heap might not contain all the necessary elements to correctly calculate the minimum cost.

#### Function `func_2()`

- **Purpose:** Read input, process each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation:**
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads the grid dimensions (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`), the grid itself, and calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - Calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
  - Prints the minimum total cost.

- **Annotations:**
  - The annotations describe the state of `total_costs` and the final output state.
  - The annotations suggest that the function is intended to correctly sum the costs of `k` consecutive rows and find the minimum total cost.

- **Correctness Consideration:**
  - The logic for summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finding the minimum total cost seems correct.
  - However, the correctness of the results heavily depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

### Conclusion

The primary issue with the given program lies in the implementation of `func_1`. The logic for handling the heap and ensuring that the minimum cost path is correctly calculated seems flawed. Specifically, the `while` loop that handles the heap could be incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct based on the provided implementation.

**Final: False**
