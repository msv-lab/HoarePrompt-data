You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing integers. The first integer in each test case is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. Each test case then consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and m (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #The program returns counter which is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, and the second line contains `n` integers. The function iterates over the list `num` in reverse order and counts the number of trailing '0' strings. However, the function always returns `0` regardless of the input values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules as described in the problem statement. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Reversing Digits by Anna**: The code does not actually reverse the digits of the numbers chosen by Anna. It only counts trailing zeros. This is incorrect because reversing digits is a key part of Anna's move.

2. **Concatenation by Sasha**: The code does not handle Sasha's move of concatenating two numbers. It only calculates the total number of digits and subtracts the number of trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine if Sasha can win.

3. **Logic for Winning Condition**: The logic to determine the winner is incorrect. The code checks if the difference between the total number of digits and the subtracted zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. This does not accurately reflect the game's winning condition, which is whether the final number after all moves is greater than or equal to `10^m`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Allow Anna to reverse the digits of any number in her turn.
- Allow Sasha to concatenate any two numbers in his turn.
- Determine the final number after all possible moves.
- Check if the final number is greater than or equal to `10^m` to decide the winner.

Given the complexity of the game and the need to simulate the optimal moves of both players, the current program is insufficient and incorrect.
