Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and contains a function (`func_3`) that does not perform the required operations to solve the problem as described. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Function `func_3` is incomplete**: The function `func_3` is supposed to perform the main logic of the problem, which is to determine the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. However, the function is currently empty and does not contain any logic to achieve this.

2. **Function `func_2` is not correctly implemented**: While `func_2` is intended to find the maximum subarray sum, it is not correctly implemented. The logic for maintaining and updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed, and it does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as arrays with all negative numbers.

3. **Function `func_1` is correctly implemented**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the modulo operation, which is necessary for the output.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:

- Implement `func_3` to use the maximum subarray sum found by `func_2` and apply the operations to maximize the array sum.
- Ensure `func_2` correctly finds the maximum subarray sum, considering all possible subarrays, including those with all negative numbers.

Here is a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. **Calculate the maximum subarray sum** using `func_2` or a similar function.
2. **Use the maximum subarray sum** to perform the operations. If the maximum subarray sum is positive, repeatedly insert it into the array to maximize the sum. If it is negative or zero, the best strategy is to insert zeros (which is equivalent to not changing the array).
3. **Compute the final sum** and take it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided code lacks the logic to perform these steps, so it is not correct.
