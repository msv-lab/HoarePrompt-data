In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer value derived from the input. The loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that the input provided to the `int(input())` function results in a positive integer, as the loop will iterate that many times.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a valid integer that meets the condition.

Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the input to `int(input())` is already guaranteed to be a valid integer within the specified range.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute, as the state already ensures that `t` is within the required range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
