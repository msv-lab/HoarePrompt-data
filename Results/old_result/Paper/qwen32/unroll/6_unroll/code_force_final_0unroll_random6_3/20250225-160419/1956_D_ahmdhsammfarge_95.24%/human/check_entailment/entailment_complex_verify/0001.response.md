### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the code and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- **Purpose**: To find the optimal subarray `[i, j]` to replace with its MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) to maximize the sum.
- **Implementation**: The function calculates a sum `sm` based on the length of the subarray and the sums of the parts of the array outside the subarray. It then checks if this sum is greater than the current maximum sum `over_sum`. If it is, it updates the indices `r` and `l` and the maximum sum.
- **Annotation**: The annotation states that the function returns the starting and ending indices of the subarray that maximizes a specific calculated sum.
- **Issue**: The function does not compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray and the sums of the parts of the array outside the subarray. This approach does not guarantee that the chosen subarray will maximize the sum after replacing it with its MEX.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: To add operations to the list `ops` recursively.
- **Implementation**: The function recursively adds operations with the same subarray bounds `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
- **Annotation**: The annotation states that the function modifies the list `ops` by appending operations in the form of pairs `[r + 1, l + 1]` based on the initial values of `r` and `l` and recursively reduces `l` until `l` equals `r`.
- **Issue**: The function does not perform any meaningful operations related to maximizing the array sum. It simply adds redundant operations, which does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: To perform the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by replacing it with its MEX.
- **Implementation**: The function replaces the subarray `[r, l]` with the length of the subarray `n` and adds multiple operations to `ops`.
- **Annotation**: The annotation states that the function modifies the input list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a new sublist containing `n` elements, each equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of the original sublist (`l - r + 1`). It also appends several operations to the `ops` list.
- **Issue**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX operation. Additionally, it adds multiple redundant operations to `ops`.

### Overall Analysis:
- **Problem**: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of a subarray or to maximize the sum of the array. The functions do not perform the intended operations and instead perform unrelated or incorrect operations.
- **Annotations**: The annotations provide a correct description of the program's behavior but do not address the logical errors in the implementation.
- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the MEX of subarrays and does not maximize the sum of the array.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
