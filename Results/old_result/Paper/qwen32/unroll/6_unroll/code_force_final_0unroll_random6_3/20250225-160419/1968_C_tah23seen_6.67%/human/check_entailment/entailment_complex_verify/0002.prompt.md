You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 499 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]

            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

    #State: ans = [arr[0] + 1, smallest multiple of ans[1] >= arr[1], smallest multiple of ans[2] >= arr[2], ..., 0]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' where the first element is arr[0] + 1, the second element is the smallest multiple of ans[1] that is greater than or equal to arr[1], the third element is the smallest multiple of ans[2] that is greater than or equal to arr[2], and so on until the last element which is ans[-2] + arr[-1].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n` (where `n` is the length of `arr` plus one). It returns a list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element is the smallest multiple of the previous element in `ans` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element in `ans` and the last element in `arr`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
- The constraints are `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
- `x` is given as an array of size `n-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. This means `a_1` is set to be greater than `x_2`.
   - This is a reasonable starting point because `a_1` can be any value greater than `x_2` to satisfy `a_2 % a_1 = x_2`.

2. **Loop for `i` from `1` to `n-2`**:
   - The program sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, it increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
   - This logic is intended to ensure that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] == arr[i + 1]`, but the logic seems flawed. Specifically, the condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` is incorrect because `ans[i + 1]` should be greater than `arr[i + 1]` for the modulo operation to work correctly.

3. **Final Element**:
   - The program sets `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
   - This does not guarantee that `ans[-1] % ans[-2] == arr[-1]`. It simply adds `arr[-1]` to the previous element, which might not satisfy the modulo condition.

### Correctness Check:
- The provided program does not correctly ensure that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
- The logic for setting `ans[i + 1]` and ensuring it satisfies the modulo condition is flawed.
- The final element `ans[-1]` is set in a way that does not guarantee the required condition.

### Correct Solution Approach:
A correct approach would be:
- Set `a_1` to any value greater than `x_2`.
- For each subsequent `a_i`, set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` (or any multiple of `a_{i-1}` plus `x_i`), ensuring that `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
