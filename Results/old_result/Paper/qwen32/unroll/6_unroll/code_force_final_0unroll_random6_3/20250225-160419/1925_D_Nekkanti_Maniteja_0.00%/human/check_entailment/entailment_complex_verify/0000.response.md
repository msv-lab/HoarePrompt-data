Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is correct or not.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The friendship values increase for pairs of friends each time they are chosen. The expected value needs to be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) and the result should be \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Program Analysis

Here is the provided code with annotations:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)  # Incorrect calculation of probability
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f  # Sum of initial friendship values
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a  # Incorrect calculation of expected value
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The probability `c` of choosing any specific pair of friends is calculated as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is incorrect because `n * (n - 1) // 1` should be `n * (n - 1) // 2` (since there are `n * (n - 1) / 2` possible pairs of children).
   - Therefore, `c` should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` is intended to calculate the expected value, but the formula used inside the loop is incorrect.
   - The expected value for each excursion should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and their current friendship value. The provided code does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over subsequent excursions.

3. **Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the scenario where a pair of children are not friends. The expected value should be 0 for non-friend pairs, and the code does not account for this correctly.

4. **Summation of Expected Values**:
   - The summation logic inside the loop is flawed. The expected value for each excursion should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and their current friendship value.

### Correct Formula Derivation

The expected value for each pair of friends can be derived as follows:
- For each friend pair, the expected value of the friendship value after `k` excursions is the sum of a geometric series.
- The expected value for a pair of friends with initial friendship value `f` after `k` excursions is:
  \[
  E = f \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{n(n-1)/2} + \left(\frac{1}{n(n-1)/2}\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(\frac{1}{n(n-1)/2}\right)^{k-1}\right)
  \]
- This simplifies to:
  \[
  E = f \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{n(n-1)/2}\right)^k}{1 - \frac{1}{n(n-1)/2}}
  \]

The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all friend pairs.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid, and the program needs to be corrected to use the proper formula for calculating the expected value.

Final: **False**
