The `print('B')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the character 'B' to the console. The initial state provided does not affect the value being printed by this statement because the statement is not dependent on any variables or conditions derived from the initial state. The variables `ac` and `bc` are mentioned as part of the test case processing but do not influence the print statement directly.

Output: **B**
