Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n`. For each `n`, it calculates and prints the sum of the values of all integers from 1 to `n`, where the value of each integer is defined recursively based on its last digit and the value of the integer obtained by removing the last digit.**
