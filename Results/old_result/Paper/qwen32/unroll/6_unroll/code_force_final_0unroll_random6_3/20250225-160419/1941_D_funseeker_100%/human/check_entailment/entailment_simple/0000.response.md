### Reasoning:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after a series of throws, given the directions that are either explicitly known or unknown.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.

2. **Logic for Determining Possible Players**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include the players that could receive the ball based on the direction and distance.
     - If the direction `c` is `0` or `?`, it adds the player who would receive the ball if the throw were clockwise.
     - If the direction `c` is `1` or `?`, it adds the player who would receive the ball if the throw were counterclockwise.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the player number wraps around correctly within the range `[1, n]`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the modulo operation results in `0`, it is replaced with `n` to ensure the player number is within the valid range.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible players and their numbers in increasing order.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles all possible directions and distances.
   - The use of a set ensures that each player is counted only once.
   - The output matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correctly implemented and handles the problem requirements accurately.

**Correctness: True**
