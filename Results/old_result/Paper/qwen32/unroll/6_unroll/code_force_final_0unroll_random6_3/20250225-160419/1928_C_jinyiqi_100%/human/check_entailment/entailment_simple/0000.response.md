Let's analyze the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotated states.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine how many values of k (where k > 1) would result in Vasya receiving a specific number (x) at a specific position (n) in the line, given the pattern of "settling" described.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case, calculates potential values of k based on the given position (n) and the number received (x), and checks if these values satisfy the conditions of the problem.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases (t) is read.
   - For each test case, the position (n) and the number received (x) are read.

2. **Checking Conditions for k:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - If these conditions are met, it proceeds to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` respectively.

3. **Finding Divisors:**
   - The `func_1` function is used to find all divisors of a given number.
   - The divisors are then filtered based on the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

4. **Collecting and Printing Results:**
   - Valid k values are collected in a list, duplicates are removed, and the count of unique valid k values is printed.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program's logic against the provided examples.

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** `n = 10`, `x = 2`
- **Expected Output:** `4` (k = 2, 3, 5, 6)

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** `n = 3`, `x = 1`
- **Expected Output:** `1` (k = 2)

#### Example 3:
- **Input:** `n = 76`, `x = 4`
- **Expected Output:** `9`

#### Example 4:
- **Input:** `n = 100`, `x = 99`
- **Expected Output:** `0`

#### Example 5:
- **Input:** `n = 1000000000`, `x = 500000000`
- **Expected Output:** `1`

The logic in the program seems to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The checks for the conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are appropriate for finding potential k values. The `func_1` function correctly finds all divisors of a number, and the filtering conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensure that only valid k values are considered.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the examples given.

**Correctness:** **True**
