Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n. x_i are integers such that -n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n and x_i != 0 for all 1 <= i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
