Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining if there exists a template string `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The matching conditions are:
- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be the same as the i-th letter of the template.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template.

The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`. This is a simplified condition that does not fully capture the problem's requirement. Specifically, `func_1` does not consider the possibility of constructing a template that satisfies the matching conditions.

For example, in the third test case:
```
10
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
```
The correct template could be "CODEforces", where:
- 'm' in "mathforces" and 'l' in "luckforces" do not match 'a' in "adhoccoder" when 'C' is used in the template.
- 'a' in "mathforces" and 'u' in "luckforces" do not match 'd' in "adhoccoder" when 'O' is used in the template.
- This pattern continues for all characters.

However, `func_1` would return 'NO' because it only checks if there is a position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, which is not sufficient to construct a valid template.

The function `func_2` appears to be correctly reading the input and processing each test case using `func_1`. However, since `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
