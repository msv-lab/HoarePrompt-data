### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment in light of the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for excursions. The expected value should correctly account for the probability of choosing a pair of friends and the increasing friendship values over subsequent excursions.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the probability `c` of choosing any specific pair of friends as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is indeed incorrect because the total number of possible pairs is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, not `n * (n - 1) // 1`.
   - The correct probability should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program's loop `for i in range(k):` is intended to accumulate the expected value. However, the formula used inside the loop is incorrect.
   - The expected value for each excursion should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and their current friendship value. The provided code does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over subsequent excursions.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value for each excursion should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and their current friendship value.

3. **Handling Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The code does not correctly handle non-friend pairs. The expected value for non-friend pairs should be 0, and the code does not account for this correctly.

4. **Summation Logic**:
   - The summation logic inside the loop is flawed. The expected value for each excursion should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and their current friendship value.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the probability calculation and the expected value calculation. The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment, the program is indeed incorrect. The probability calculation and the expected value summation logic need to be corrected to match the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
