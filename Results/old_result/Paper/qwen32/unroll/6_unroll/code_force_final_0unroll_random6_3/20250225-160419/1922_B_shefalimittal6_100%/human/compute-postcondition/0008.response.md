Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `results` is a list that contains the results for each of the `t` test cases.
- `idx` is a variable that has been incremented by `2 + n` for each test case, where `n` is the number of integers in that test case.
- The variables `t`, `data`, and other variables not modified by the loop remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation:
- The `results` list contains the results for each of the `t` test cases. Since the exact contents of `results` are not provided, we can describe it as a list of strings, each representing the result for a specific test case.
- The `'\n'.join(results)` expression joins all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the contents of the `results` list, with each result on a new line.

### Final Answer:
Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the results for each of the t test cases)**
