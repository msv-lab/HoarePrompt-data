Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given description. The logic in the function `func()` seems to have several issues and does not properly count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

The conditions for the problem are:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\)
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The program incorrectly initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It then iterates through values of `count` up to `m`, but the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is flawed. The program does not correctly calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) and check the conditions for each pair \((a, b)\).

A correct approach would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if the conditions are satisfied. This can be optimized using properties of gcd and multiples, but the provided code does not implement this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program that uses a brute-force approach to verify the conditions for each pair:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This brute-force approach checks each pair \((a, b)\) to see if it satisfies the conditions, which is feasible given the constraints. However, for a more efficient solution, optimizations using mathematical properties would be necessary.
