You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:

        elif a % 2 == 1:

            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')

    #State: the sequence of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed for each test case based on the values of `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions related to the values of `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who start with `a` and `b` coins respectively. They take turns removing one coin from their current wallet, with the option to swap wallets before each turn. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally.

The program provided makes decisions based on the values of `a` and `b`:

1. If `a == b`, the program outputs 'Bob'. This is correct because if both players have the same number of coins, Alice will always be the one to face a situation where both wallets are empty, and hence she will lose.
2. If `a == 1`, the program outputs 'Alice'. This is incorrect. If Alice has only one coin, she can swap with Bob if he has more than one coin, ensuring that Bob eventually faces a situation where he has to remove the last coin from his wallet, thus losing. If Bob also has one coin, Alice will lose as per the first condition.
3. If `b == 1`, the program outputs 'Bob'. This is incorrect for the same reason as the previous case. If Bob has only one coin, Alice can swap with Bob if he has more than one coin, ensuring that Bob eventually faces a situation where he has to remove the last coin from his wallet, thus losing. If Alice also has one coin, Bob will lose as per the first condition.
4. If `a % 2 == 1`, the program outputs 'Bob'. This is incorrect. The parity of `a` alone does not determine the winner. The optimal strategy involves both `a` and `b`.
5. If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`, the program outputs 'Alice'. This is incorrect. The parity of both `a` and `b` does not fully determine the winner. The optimal strategy involves both `a` and `b`.
6. If `a > b`, the program outputs 'Bob'. This is incorrect. The number of coins alone does not determine the winner if both players play optimally.
7. If none of the above conditions are met, the program outputs 'Alice'. This is incorrect for similar reasons as the previous cases.

The correct strategy involves considering the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`:
- If `a + b` is odd, Alice will win. This is because Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by maintaining the odd sum after her turn.
- If `a + b` is even, Bob will win. This is because Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by maintaining the even sum after his turn.

Let's correct the logic based on the above reasoning.

Here is the corrected reasoning and the correct program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Based on the above analysis, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
