### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to split the array into two subsequences such that the sum of the penalties of the two subsequences is minimized. The penalty for a subsequence is defined as the number of times an element in the subsequence is smaller than the next element.

The provided program aims to find the minimum penalty by tracking the smallest and second smallest elements in the array. The logic is as follows:

1. Initialize `a` and `b` to infinity to represent the smallest and second smallest elements encountered so far.
2. Iterate through the array.
3. Ensure `a` is always the smaller of the two.
4. If the current element is less than or equal to `a`, update `a` to be the current element.
5. If the current element is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, update `b` to be the current element.
6. If the current element is greater than both `a` and `b`, it means we have encountered an element that breaks the order of the smallest and second smallest elements encountered so far. In this case, increment the penalty counter `c` and update `a` to be the current element (since `b` is no longer the second smallest).

The core idea is that for each element in the array, we are trying to determine if it can be part of a subsequence where the elements are in non-decreasing order. If it cannot (i.e., it is greater than both the smallest and second smallest elements seen so far), we increment the penalty counter.

The program correctly implements this logic and calculates the minimum penalty possible by ensuring that we count the number of times the order of the smallest and second smallest elements is broken.

### Execution Summary:

The execution summary explains that the function iterates through the array and counts how many times the smallest element needs to be updated to maintain the order of the two smallest distinct elements encountered so far. This effectively counts the number of times the list cannot be extended with a new smallest element without breaking the order, which is precisely the penalty we need to calculate.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by following the described logic.
