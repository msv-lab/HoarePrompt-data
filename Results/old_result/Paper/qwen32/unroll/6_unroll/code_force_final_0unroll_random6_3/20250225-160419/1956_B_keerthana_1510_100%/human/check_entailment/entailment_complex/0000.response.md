Reasoning:  
The given program is not correct for the problem described. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. The provided program, however, simply counts the number of integers that appear more than once in the list of cards you have. This count does not reflect the optimal strategy or the points you would score based on the game rules.

The program should implement a strategy to simulate the game and calculate the points based on the optimal moves by both players. The current implementation does not take into account the turns, the placement of cards on the table, or the interaction between your moves and Nene's optimal responses.

Correctness: **False**
