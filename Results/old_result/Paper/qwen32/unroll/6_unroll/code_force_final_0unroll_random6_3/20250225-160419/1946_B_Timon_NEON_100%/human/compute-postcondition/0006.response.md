The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is a concatenation of `max_segment` and a single-element list containing `len(arr) - 1`.

Given:
- `max_segment` is `[12, 6]`
- `len(arr) - 1` is an integer representing the last index of the list `arr`.

The new list to be appended is `[12, 6, len(arr) - 1]`.

Therefore, `segments_variants` will now include this new list as its last element.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9; `new_segment` is [5, 6]; `max_segment` is [12, 6]; `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [9, 4], [12, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1.**
