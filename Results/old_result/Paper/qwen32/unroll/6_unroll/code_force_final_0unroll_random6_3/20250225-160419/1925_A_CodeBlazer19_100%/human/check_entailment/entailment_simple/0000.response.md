Reasoning:
The given program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then prints a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times.

However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the generated string. For example, if `n` is 2 and `k` is 2, the program will output "aabb", but the string "ba" does not appear as a subsequence in "aabb".

The correct approach would involve generating a De Bruijn sequence for the given `n` and `k`, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears exactly once as a substring. However, the program does not implement this logic.

Given the provided output examples, it is clear that the program does not produce the correct output for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
