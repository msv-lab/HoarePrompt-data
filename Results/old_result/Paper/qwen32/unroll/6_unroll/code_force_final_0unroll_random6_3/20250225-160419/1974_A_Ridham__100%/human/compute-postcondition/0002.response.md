The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `result` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted. 

Given that `n` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` â‰¥ 1, `result` is an empty list**
