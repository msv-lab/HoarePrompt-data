The code snippet `ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])` appends a new element to the list `ops`. The new element is a list containing the values `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The initial state specifies that `ops` already contains the elements `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, r + 1]`. After the execution of the code, `ops` will have an additional element `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it. The values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that now contains an additional element [r + 1, l + 1] making it have [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, r + 1], and [r + 1, l + 1]. The condition that the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0 has been identified.**
