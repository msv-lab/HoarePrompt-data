The variable `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `numbers`. This means `hcf` is now equal to `t`, the number of test cases. The other elements in the list `numbers` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers where the first integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines. Each pair starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `hcf` is `t`.**
