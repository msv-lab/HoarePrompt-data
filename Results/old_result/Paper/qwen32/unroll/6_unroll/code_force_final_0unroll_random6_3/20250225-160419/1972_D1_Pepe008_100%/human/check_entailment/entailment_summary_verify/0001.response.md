### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach than what is directly implied by the problem statement. Let's break down the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Calculating the Number of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - It checks if \(x\) is greater than 0, and if so, adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it increments `suma` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Misunderstanding of the Problem:**
   - The program's logic does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the conditions checked do not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not explained or justified by the problem statement.
   - There is no clear explanation of how the program ensures that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Incorrect Loop Variable:**
   - The program uses `i` in the loop, but `i` is not defined in the context of the loop. It seems like `i` should be `b` in the context of the loop, but the logic still does not align with the problem.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.
- For each pair, checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Verification Using Function Summary:
The function summary provided states that the function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these integers and prints the result minus 2. This summary does not provide any insight into how the specific sum is calculated or how it relates to the problem statement. Therefore, the summary does not validate the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program's logic and the lack of alignment with the problem statement, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
