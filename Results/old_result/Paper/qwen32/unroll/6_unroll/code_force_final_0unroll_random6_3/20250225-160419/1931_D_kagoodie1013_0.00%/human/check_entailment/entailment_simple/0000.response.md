### Reasoning:

The program is intended to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. A pair \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The provided program uses two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the remainder for the `mod_x_map`.

Let's break down the logic:

- For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates:
  - `mod_x = -num % x` which is incorrect for the purpose of finding pairs where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. The correct remainder should be `num % x`.
  - `mod_y = num % y` which is correct for finding pairs where `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

- The program then updates the count by adding the number of times `-num % x` and `num % y` have been seen before (stored in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` respectively).

- After updating the count, it increments the counts of `num % x` and `num % y` in the respective maps.

The mistake in calculating `mod_x` as `-num % x` instead of `num % x` leads to incorrect results. This is because the condition for `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x` should be based on the sum of the positive remainders, not the negative remainders.

### Correctness:

Given the mistake in the calculation of `mod_x`, the program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
