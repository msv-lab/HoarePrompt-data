Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts. The price for one yogurt is `a` burles, and the price for two yogurts is `b` burles. We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis
The provided program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it determines the minimum cost based on the following logic:
1. If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is less than or equal to the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`), it calculates the total cost by considering as many pairs of yogurts as possible and any remaining single yogurt.
2. If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is more than the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`), it simply calculates the total cost by buying all yogurts individually.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Condition for Promotion**:
   - The original program checks if `b * 2 < a`. This condition is incorrect because it should be `b <= 2 * a` to ensure that buying two yogurts at the promotion price is not more expensive than buying them individually.
   
2. **Calculation for Odd `n`**:
   - For odd `n`, the program incorrectly prints `X` (the number of pairs) before calculating the total cost. It should directly calculate the total cost as `X * b + remaining * a`.

### Corrected Program
Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= 2 * a:
            pairs = n // 2
            remaining = n % 2
            print(pairs * b + remaining * a)
        else:
            print(n * a)

# Example input:
# 4
# 2 5 9
# 3 5 9
# 3 5 11
# 4 5 11

# Expected output:
# 9
# 14
# 15
# 20
```

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary provided in the original assessment is incorrect because:
- It incorrectly describes the condition for the promotion.
- It incorrectly describes the calculation for odd `n`.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the program and provides a corrected version. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment. The corrected version of the program should be used to ensure the correct calculation of the minimum cost.
