Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`, and then determines the output based on specific conditions related to the value of `k` and the values of `n` and `m`. The output for each test case is printed on a new line.**
