testcases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. Each integer in the tuples is within the range -1000 to 1000. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
