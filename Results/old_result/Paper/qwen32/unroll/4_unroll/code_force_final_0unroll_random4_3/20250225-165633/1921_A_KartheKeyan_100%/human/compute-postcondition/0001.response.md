The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state indicates that `n` is decremented by 1 after processing each test case until `n` is 0, but this decrement operation is not included in the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `n` is assigned the value from the input.

Output State: **There are `t` test cases where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. For each test case, `l` is an integer read from input, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2`, and printed. `n` is assigned the value from the input. The coordinates `x_i, y_i` remain unchanged.**
