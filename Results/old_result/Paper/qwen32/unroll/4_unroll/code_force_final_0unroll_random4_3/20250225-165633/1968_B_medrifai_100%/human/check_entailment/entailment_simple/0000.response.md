### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to find the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to find the next occurrence of the current character in `a` within the remaining part of `b`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `i` and `j` to 0, which represent the current positions in strings `a` and `b`, respectively. It also initializes `c` to 0, which counts the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

2. **Loop**: The program uses a `while` loop to iterate as long as `j` (the position in `b`) is less than `m` (the length of `b`) and `i` (the position in `a`) is less than `n` (the length of `a`).

3. **Finding the Next Occurrence**: Inside the loop, the program calls `func_1` with the current positions `i` and `j`. This function searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from position `j`.

4. **Updating Positions and Counter**:
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (`new_j`), it means the character `a[i]` was found in `b`. The program then updates `j` to `new_j + 1` to move past the found character in `b`, increments `i` to move to the next character in `a`, and increments `c` to count this match.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it means the character `a[i]` was not found in the remaining part of `b`, and the loop breaks.

5. **Output**: After the loop completes, the program prints the value of `c`, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- `a = "10011"`
- `b = "1110"`

- **Iteration 1**: `i = 0`, `j = 0`
  - `func_1(a, b, 0, 0)` finds `a[0] = '1'` at `b[0]`, returns `0`.
  - Update: `j = 1`, `i = 1`, `c = 1`.

- **Iteration 2**: `i = 1`, `j = 1`
  - `func_1(a, b, 1, 1)` finds `a[1] = '0'` at `b[3]`, returns `3`.
  - Update: `j = 4`, `i = 2`, `c = 2`.

- **Iteration 3**: `i = 2`, `j = 4`
  - `func_1(a, b, 2, 4)` does not find `a[2] = '0'` in the remaining part of `b`, returns `-1`.
  - Break loop.

The program correctly outputs `2`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`.

Correctness: **True**
