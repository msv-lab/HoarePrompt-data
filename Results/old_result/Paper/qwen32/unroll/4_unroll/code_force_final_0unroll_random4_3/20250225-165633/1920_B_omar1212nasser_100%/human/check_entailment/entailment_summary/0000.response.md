Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem described.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, which represent the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can negate, respectively.
   - It then reads the list of `n` integers `a`.
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The function calls `func_2` with the arguments `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - The result returned by `func_2` is printed as the output for that test case.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice's removals and Bob's negations.
   - It starts by initializing a list `pos` to store potential sums.
   - The initial sum `s` is the sum of all elements in the array.
   - The first potential sum is calculated by considering the effect of Bob negating the `x` largest elements in the sorted array. This is done by subtracting twice the sum of the `x` largest elements from `s` (since negating an element subtracts twice its value from the sum).
   - The function then iterates over the range from 1 to `removals` (inclusive). For each iteration:
     - It subtracts the `i`-th largest element from the sum `s` (simulating Alice's removal of elements).
     - It updates the sum `s2` of the `negatives + i` largest elements.
     - It calculates a new potential sum by considering the effect of Bob negating the `negatives + i` largest elements.
     - This new potential sum is added to the list `pos`.
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played optimally.

The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly simulate the optimal moves of both Alice and Bob:
- Alice will remove the largest elements first to maximize the remaining sum.
- Bob will negate the largest remaining elements to minimize the sum.

The sorting of the array in `func_1` ensures that the largest elements are easily accessible for both removal and negation.

Given the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
