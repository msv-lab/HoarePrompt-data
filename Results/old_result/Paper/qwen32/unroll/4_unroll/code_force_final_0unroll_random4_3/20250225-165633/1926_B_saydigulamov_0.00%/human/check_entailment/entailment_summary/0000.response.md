Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. The program only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal and prints the counts if they are. This is not sufficient to determine the shape of the figure. 

To correctly identify the shape, the program should analyze the entire grid to verify whether the '1's form a square or a triangle according to the given definitions. Specifically, for a square, all rows containing '1's should have the same number of '1's, and these '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern of an increasing or decreasing sequence (1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1) with the central 1s aligned vertically.

Given the current implementation, the program fails to perform these checks and instead just prints the counts of '1's in the first two rows if they are equal. This does not match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
