Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program trims leading zeros by repeatedly popping the first element of `a` as long as it is `0`.
   - Similarly, it trims trailing zeros by repeatedly popping the last element of `a` as long as it is `0`.
   - This step ensures that the list `a` now contains only the relevant segment with chips and free cells between them.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program initializes `res` to `0`, which will store the number of operations needed.
   - It then iterates through the trimmed list `a` and counts the number of `0`s.
   - Each `0` encountered in the trimmed list represents a free cell that a chip will have to move past to form a contiguous block.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of `0`s for each test case, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Trimming Zeros:** Trimming leading and trailing zeros is a valid step because it reduces the problem to the smallest segment that contains chips and the free cells between them. This is crucial because operations are only meaningful within this segment.
  
- **Counting Free Cells:** Counting the number of `0`s in the trimmed list is the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations. Each `0` represents a free cell that a chip will have to move past to form a contiguous block.

- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as all chips already in a block (no `0`s in the trimmed list), which results in `0` operations.

- **Output:** The program prints the result for each test case as required.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single contiguous block. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
