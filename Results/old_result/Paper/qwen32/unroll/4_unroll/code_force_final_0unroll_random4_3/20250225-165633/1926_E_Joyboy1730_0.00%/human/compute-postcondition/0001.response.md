In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is determined by the user input. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's execution, we only need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

According to the problem statement, `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. 

Given that `t` is already defined by the input, we don't need to adjust its value if it falls within the specified range. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be ensured to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4**
