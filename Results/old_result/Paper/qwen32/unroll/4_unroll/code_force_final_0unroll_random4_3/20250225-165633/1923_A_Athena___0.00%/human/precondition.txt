test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1). In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip (i.e., at least one a_i is 1). The first element of each tuple is the integer n, and the second element is the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
