You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m

                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: A series of integers printed to the console, each corresponding to the result of the operations within each iteration of the outer loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues:

1. **Initialization and Usage of List `L`:** The list `L` is initialized but never populated. The program attempts to use `L` later, but it remains empty, which means no values are being stored or used.

2. **Logic for Determining Card Order:** The program does not generate the sequence of cards as described in the problem statement. It fails to lay down the odd-numbered cards first, then the cards that are twice an odd number, and so on.

3. **Calculation of `tot` and `k`:** The logic for adjusting `tot` and `k` is not correctly implemented. The program does not correctly determine the position of the k-th card in the sequence.

4. **Output of the k-th Card:** The program does not correctly output the k-th card. The formula `pow * (2 * k - 1)` is not appropriate for determining the k-th card in the sequence.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
7 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program does not produce any output because the list `L` is empty, and the loop that would print the k-th card is never entered.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, it is incorrect.
