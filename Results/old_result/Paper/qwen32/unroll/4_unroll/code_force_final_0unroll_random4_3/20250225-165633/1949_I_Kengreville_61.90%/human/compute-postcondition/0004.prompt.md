Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` represents the radius of the i-th disk. `visited[i]` is now `True`, indicating that the i-th disk has been visited. `nodes` is a list that now includes `i`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are lists used to keep track of nodes in the current DFS traversal, coefficients for radius adjustments, and their signs, respectively. `n` is the total number of disks.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
