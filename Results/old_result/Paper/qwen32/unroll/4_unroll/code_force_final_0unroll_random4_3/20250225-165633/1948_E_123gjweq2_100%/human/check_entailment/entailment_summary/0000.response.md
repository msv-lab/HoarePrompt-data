### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its behavior in the context of the problem statement.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to assign distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that edges are added based on the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\). The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and provide the assignment of integers to vertices and the clique partition.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two lists: `arr` (to hold the integer assignments for vertices) and `cliquess` (to hold the clique assignments for vertices).
   - It calls `make_array` for each block of vertices, assigning a unique clique number to each block.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - This function modifies `arr` and `cliquess` for a segment of vertices from `left` to `right`.
   - It fills the first half of the segment with increasing values starting from `small_element`.
   - It fills the second half of the segment with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.
   - It assigns the same clique number to all vertices in the segment.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `arr` and `cliquess`**:
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized as global lists but are not passed to `make_array` as parameters. This means that `make_array` modifies global variables, which is not ideal for understanding and maintaining the code.
   
2. **Assigning Values to `arr`**:
   - The code attempts to assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` in a specific manner, but it does not ensure that the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) holds for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
   - The assignment of values in `make_array` does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem statement.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `n = 5, k = 4`, the code might output:
     - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
     - `cliques = 2`
     - `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
   - However, this does not necessarily mean that the resulting graph can be partitioned into 2 cliques where the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) holds for all pairs within each clique.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not guarantee that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques while satisfying the given condition. The assignment of values to `arr` and the partitioning into cliques do not ensure the required properties of the graph.

### Correctness: **False**
