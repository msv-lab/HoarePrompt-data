t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n matrix consisting of characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
