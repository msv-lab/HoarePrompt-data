### Reasoning:

The provided Python program reads multiple test cases where each test case describes a game of passing a ball among players arranged in a circle. For each throw, we are given the distance the ball is thrown and the direction (clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown). The program's task is to determine which players could have the ball after all the throws, considering all possible directions for throws where the direction is unknown.

#### Key Points:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program uses `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` to read input values. These functions read the number of test cases, the parameters for each test case, and the details of each throw.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it calculates the possible new positions of the ball based on the direction:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - After processing each throw, the set `ans` is updated to `temp`.
   
3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` because player positions are 1-indexed.
   
4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and their IDs in increasing order.

#### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  6 3 2
  2 ?
  2 ?
  2 ?
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - Initial position: `ans = {2}`
  - First throw (`r = 2`, `c = '?'`):
    - Possible positions: `(2 + 2) % 6 = 4`, `(2 - 2) % 6 = 0` (replaced by `6`)
    - `ans = {4, 6}`
  - Second throw (`r = 2`, `c = '?'`):
    - Possible positions from `4`: `(4 + 2) % 6 = 0` (replaced by `6`), `(4 - 2) % 6 = 2`
    - Possible positions from `6`: `(6 + 2) % 6 = 2`, `(6 - 2) % 6 = 4`
    - `ans = {2, 4, 6}`
  - Third throw (`r = 2`, `c = '?'`):
    - Possible positions from `2`: `(2 + 2) % 6 = 4`, `(2 - 2) % 6 = 0` (replaced by `6`)
    - Possible positions from `4`: `(4 + 2) % 6 = 0` (replaced by `6`), `(4 - 2) % 6 = 2`
    - Possible positions from `6`: `(6 + 2) % 6 = 2`, `(6 - 2) % 6 = 4`
    - `ans = {2, 4, 6}`
- **Output:**
  ```
  3
  2 4 6
  ```
This matches the expected output, confirming that the program works correctly for this test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes each test case and determines the possible players who could have the ball after all throws, considering all possible directions for unknown throws. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
