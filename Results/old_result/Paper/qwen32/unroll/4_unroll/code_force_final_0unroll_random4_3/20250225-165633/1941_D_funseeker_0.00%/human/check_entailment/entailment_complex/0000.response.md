### Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the program step-by-step and verify its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` reads the first line of input and converts it to an integer, which represents the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input, splits it by whitespace, and converts each substring to an integer, returning the list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4()` processes each test case. It first reads the initial conditions (number of players `n`, number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`).
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
     - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?' (unknown), it adds `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp` for each `q` in `ans`.
     - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?' (unknown), it adds `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp` for each `q` in `ans`.
   - After processing each throw, `ans` is updated to `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program ensures that if `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced by `n` (since player numbers are from 1 to `n`).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case independently.
- The use of a set for `ans` ensures that only unique players are considered.
- The modulo operation correctly handles the circular nature of the players.
- The replacement of `0` with `n` ensures that player numbers remain within the valid range.
- The program outputs the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem requirements and correctly processes the input to produce the desired output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
