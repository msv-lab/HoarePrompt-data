Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to ensure it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a subarray can be split into \( k > 1 \) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The program should handle multiple test cases, each with an array and several queries specifying subarrays to check.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes the input to extract the number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, the number of queries, the array elements, and the query ranges.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - For each test case, it calculates the prefix XOR array (`pf`) where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element.
   - It maintains a dictionary (`mp`) mapping each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, it means the subarray can be split into any number of segments with the same XOR value (since the XOR of the entire subarray is `0`), so the subarray is "interesting".
   - If `x` is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array where the prefix XOR value is the same at the start and end of the subarray, but not at the boundaries. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the list of occurrences of the prefix XOR values.
   - If such indices exist and are valid (i.e., the subarray can be split into two or more segments with the same XOR value), the subarray is "interesting".

4. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results for all queries and prints them in the required format.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a bitwise XOR of zero. The function outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise.

### Evaluation:

The function summary and the reasoning provided in the original assessment are accurate. The program correctly uses prefix XOR and binary search to efficiently determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The logic for checking if a subarray is "interesting" is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate, and the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Final: **True**
