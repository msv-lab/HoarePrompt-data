### Reasoning:
The program correctly interprets the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it initializes variables:
     - `cx` as a set to store the values that \( k \) must not be equal to.
     - `ax` as a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to find the minimum upper bound.
     - `bx` as -1 to find the maximum lower bound.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type \( a \) and the value \( x \).
     - If \( a = 1 \), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and \( x \) (ensuring \( k \geq x \)).
     - If \( a = 2 \), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and \( x \) (ensuring \( k \leq x \)).
     - If \( a = 3 \), it adds \( x \) to the set `cx` (ensuring \( k \neq x \)).

3. **Validation and Calculation:**
   - After processing all constraints for a test case, the program checks if the maximum lower bound `bx` is greater than the minimum upper bound `ax`.
     - If `bx > ax`, it means there are no valid integers \( k \) that can satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`.
     - It iterates through the set `cx` and counts how many of these values fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - It then calculates the total number of valid \( k \) as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of invalid values in `cx`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) for each test case. It ensures that all constraints are respected and handles edge cases appropriately.
