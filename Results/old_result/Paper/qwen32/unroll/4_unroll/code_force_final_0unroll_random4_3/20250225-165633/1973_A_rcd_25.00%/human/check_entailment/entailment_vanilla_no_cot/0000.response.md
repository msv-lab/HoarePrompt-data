Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Analysis

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is correct because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, 1 to each in a draw, or 0 to the loser and 2 to the winner).
   
2. **Handling Draws:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because in this scenario, all the games between the highest scoring player (p3) and the other two players could have been draws, and the remaining games could have been wins for p3, resulting in a maximum number of draws equal to `p1 + p2`.
   
3. **Complex Case Handling:**
   - For the case where `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates the range of possible draws using `low` and `high` values.
   - It then iteratively checks if a configuration of wins and draws can satisfy the given scores.
   - The check `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining games between p1 and p2 can be distributed in a way that their scores match the given input.
   - If a valid configuration is found, the program prints the total number of draws, which is `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no valid configuration is found after the loop, it defaults to printing `p3`.

### Issues in the Program

The logic in the program seems correct, but there are some edge cases and potential issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Default Case Handling:**
   - The `else` block after the `while` loop defaults to printing `p3` if no valid configuration is found. This is incorrect because it should print `-1` in such cases, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), but it implicitly handles this by printing `0` when the sum of scores is even and `p1 + p2` is `0`.

### Corrected Program

To fix the program, we need to change the default case in the `else` block to print `-1`:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(-1)  # Corrected this line to print -1

# Your response:
Correctness: **False**
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the default case when no valid configuration is found. The corrected version fixes this issue and should work correctly for all valid inputs.
