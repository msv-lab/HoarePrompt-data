To determine what is printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the formula for `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. (This variable `t` is not used in the given code snippet, so it can be ignored for this task.)
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^6. (The variable `k` is not used in the given code snippet, so it can be ignored for this task.)
- `ans` is calculated using the formula: `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2))`.
- `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Initial Term**: The first part of `ans` is simply `n`.
2. **Summation Term**: The summation part of `ans` is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{sum}\left(\left(\frac{n + i}{i \times i}\right) \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(2, \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 2)\right)
   \]
   - This means we iterate from `i = 2` to `i = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` (inclusive).
   - For each `i` in this range, we compute the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)`.
   - We sum up all these computed values.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n` and the calculated summation term.

Given the initial state and the formula, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without specific values for `n` and `k`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` in terms of `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2))**
