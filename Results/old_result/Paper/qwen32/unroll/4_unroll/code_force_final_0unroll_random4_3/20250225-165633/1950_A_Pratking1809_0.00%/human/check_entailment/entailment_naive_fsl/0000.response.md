Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has an issue in the logic of the `else` statement. The `else` statement is currently associated with the second `if` condition (`if a < b > c`) rather than the first `if` condition (`if a < b < c`). This means that if the first `if` condition is true, the program will print "STAIR" and then still check the second `if` condition, which is incorrect. If the first `if` condition is false, it should then check the second `if` condition and only if both conditions are false, it should print "NONE". 

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

In the corrected version, I replaced the second `if` with an `elif`. This ensures that the `else` block is only reached if neither of the first two conditions is met, which is the intended behavior.
