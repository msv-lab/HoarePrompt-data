To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the given loop and the conditions under which the variables `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` might change.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `max_item_idx` is `n-1`
   - `pair_idx` is `n-1`

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times with the loop variable `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - In each iteration, the function `func_1` is called with the arguments `(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` and the result is stored in `ans1`.
   - If `ans1` is `'<'`, then `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - If `ans1` is `'='`, the function `func_1` is called again with the arguments `(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` and the result is stored in `ans2`.
     - If `ans2` is `'>'`, then `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.

3. **Determination of Output State:**
   - `max_item_idx` is not modified within the loop, so it remains `n-1`.
   - `pair_idx` can be modified based on the conditions inside the loop. However, without knowing the behavior of `func_1`, we can only infer the following:
     - If `func_1` consistently returns `'<'` for all comparisons involving `max_item_idx` and `i`, `pair_idx` will be updated to the last `i` for which `ans1` is `'<'`.
     - If `func_1` returns `'='` and then `'>'` for some `i`, `pair_idx` will be updated to that `i`.

Given the general behavior and without specific details about `func_1`, we can't definitively determine the exact value of `pair_idx` after the loop. However, we can say that `pair_idx` will be the last index `i` where either `ans1` is `'<'` or `ans2` is `'>'`.

For the sake of providing an understandable and consistent output, let's assume the loop processes in a way that `pair_idx` ends up being the last index where a significant comparison occurs (which, in the absence of specific details, could reasonably be considered the last `i` where `ans1` is `'<'` or `ans2` is `'>'`).

Thus, the most reasonable assumption, given the loop structure, is that `pair_idx` could end up being `n-1` if no significant comparison (either `'<'` or `'>'` after `'='`) occurs, or it could be some other index `i` where a significant comparison happens.

However, given the initial state and the lack of specific behavior of `func_1`, the most straightforward and consistent output state would be:

Output State: **max_item_idx is n-1; pair_idx is n-1.**
