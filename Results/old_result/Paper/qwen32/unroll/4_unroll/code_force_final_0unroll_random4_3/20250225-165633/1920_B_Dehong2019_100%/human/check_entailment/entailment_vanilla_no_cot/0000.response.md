Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Here are the key issues:

1. **Alice's Optimal Move**: Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array. The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the `k` smallest elements from the array. The current program sorts the array in descending order and then starts removing elements from the start, which is incorrect.

2. **Bob's Optimal Move**: Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array. After Alice removes elements, Bob should flip the sign of the `x` smallest remaining elements. The current program incorrectly assumes that Bob will always flip the sign of the first `x` elements in the remaining array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice's move: remove k smallest elements
        a.sort()
        remaining = a[k:]
        
        # Bob's move: flip the sign of x smallest elements in the remaining array
        remaining.sort()
        for i in range(min(x, len(remaining))):
            remaining[i] = -remaining[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        final_sum = sum(remaining)
        print(final_sum)

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Sorts the array and removes the `k` smallest elements.
- Sorts the remaining elements and flips the sign of the `x` smallest elements.
- Computes the final sum of the array.
