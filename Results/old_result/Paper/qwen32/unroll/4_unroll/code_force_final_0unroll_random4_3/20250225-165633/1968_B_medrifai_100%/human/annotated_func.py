#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function `func_1` is called with a, b, i, and j, where i and j are indices representing the current position in strings a and b, respectively.
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the value of `j` plus the value of `index`, where `index` is the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from position `j`.
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two integer indices `i` and `j`. It returns the position in `b` where the character `a[i]` first appears, starting the search from position `j` in `b`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from position `j`, it returns -1.
