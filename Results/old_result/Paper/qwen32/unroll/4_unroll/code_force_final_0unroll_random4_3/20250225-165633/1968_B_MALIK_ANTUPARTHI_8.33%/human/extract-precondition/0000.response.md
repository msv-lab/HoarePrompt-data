Precondition: **The function takes no arguments but operates on input provided as described. The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively, followed by the binary strings a and b themselves. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
