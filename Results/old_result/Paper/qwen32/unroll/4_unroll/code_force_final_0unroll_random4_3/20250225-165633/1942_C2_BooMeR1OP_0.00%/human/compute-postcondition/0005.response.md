The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `x - 2`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `present`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `ans` is `x - 2`.**
