Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It also reads the array `a` of `n` integers.
   - The array `a` is then sorted.

2. **Logic in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have played their moves.
   - The function starts by checking if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. If so, it returns 0. This is a hardcoded case and does not follow the general logic of the game.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of all elements and the sum `n` of the `negatives` largest elements.
   - It then calculates the sum after removing the `removals` largest elements and flipping the `negatives` largest remaining elements.
   - The function iterates from 1 to `removals`, updating the sum `s` by subtracting the `i`-th largest element and adjusting `n` accordingly.
   - It appends each possible sum to the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

### Issues:
- The hardcoded condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is incorrect and does not follow the game's logic.
- The program does not correctly handle all cases, especially when `removals` and `negatives` are not 6 and 3, respectively.
- The logic for updating `n` and `s` is flawed. Specifically, `n` should be recalculated correctly based on the remaining elements after removals, and the flipping of elements should be considered more carefully.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. It fails to handle the general case correctly due to the hardcoded condition and incorrect logic for updating sums and handling element removals and flips.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
