The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `result`. None of the other variables are affected by this code snippet. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range and that there are test cases with integers `x` and `y` for each of these test cases. The variable `n` is also mentioned as an input integer but is not used in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer; `result` is an empty list.**
