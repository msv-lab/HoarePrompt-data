### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function reads the input, which includes the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` and then calls `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - It prints the result returned by `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is supposed to compute the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob have made their moves.
   - It first checks if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, returning 0 in that case. This is a hardcoded condition that does not seem to align with the problem description.
   - Otherwise, it initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the sum of the array `s` and the sum of the `negatives` largest elements `n`.
   - It appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos`. This calculation seems to account for the effect of Bob flipping the `negatives` largest elements.
   - It then iterates over possible removals from 1 to `removals`, updating `s` and `n` accordingly and appending the new calculated sum to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

### Issues with the Implementation:

1. **Hardcoded Condition:**
   - The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is not explained and does not seem to be part of the optimal strategy described in the problem. This could lead to incorrect results for specific inputs.

2. **Logic for Sum Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the sums in `func_2` seems flawed. The calculation `s - 2 * n` is not correct for all scenarios. Bob can flip up to `x` elements, and Alice can remove up to `k` elements. The optimal strategy involves carefully choosing which elements to remove and which to flip to minimize or maximize the sum, respectively.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The approach in `func_2` does not seem to account for the optimal strategy for both players. It should consider the combination of removing elements and flipping elements to reach the optimal sum.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the hardcoded condition and the flawed logic for sum calculation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
