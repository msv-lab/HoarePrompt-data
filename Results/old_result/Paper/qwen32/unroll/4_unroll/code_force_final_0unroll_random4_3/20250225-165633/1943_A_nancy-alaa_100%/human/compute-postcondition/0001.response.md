To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

The given code processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It then uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. The goal is to find and print the smallest integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that meets one of the following conditions:
1. `i` is not present in the list `arr`.
2. `i` is present in the list `arr` exactly once and there is at least one other integer in the list that is also present exactly once.

The loop iterates over the range `[0, n]` and checks these conditions. Once it finds an integer that meets the criteria, it prints the integer and breaks out of the loop. This process is repeated for each test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state of variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` is reset at the beginning of each iteration, the final output state will be determined by the printed values for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` will be in their initial state at the start of the next test case, and the variable `first` will be reset to `False` at the start of each test case.

**Output State:** The output state consists of the printed integers for each test case, which are the smallest integers meeting the specified conditions. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` will be in their initial state at the start of the next test case or if there are no more test cases, they will remain in their last assigned state.

Output State: **The printed integers for each test case, with variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` in their initial state for the next test case or the last assigned state if no more test cases.**
