The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which is used to determine the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Given the above, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be greater than 0**
