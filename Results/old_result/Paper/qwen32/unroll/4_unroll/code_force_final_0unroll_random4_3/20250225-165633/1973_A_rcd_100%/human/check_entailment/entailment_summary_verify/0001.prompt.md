You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted integer scores representing the scores of three players. For each test case, it determines and prints a value based on the scores: `-1` if the sum of the scores is odd, `p1 + p2` if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, or a calculated value derived from balancing the scores otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players in chess games, under the constraints that:
- The scores are non-decreasing, i.e., p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.
- Scores are derived from games where winners get 2 points, losers get 0, and draws result in 1 point for each player.
- If the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, we should print -1.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. **Check Total Points Modulo 2**: It first checks if the sum of the scores (p1 + p2 + p3) is even. This is because every game contributes either 2 points (if there's a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it's a draw). Thus, the total points must be even.
2. **Score Condition Check**: If p3 (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (p1 + p2), it prints p1 + p2 as the maximum number of draws. This is because if p3 is at least as high as the sum of the other two scores, the only way to achieve this is if all games between the player with p3 and the other two players ended in draws (each draw contributing 1 point to p3 and 1 point to the other player).
3. **Iterative Check for Draws**: If the above condition is not met, the program iterates over possible numbers of draws between p1 and p2 (variable x) and between p3 and the other two (variable y). It checks if the remaining points after accounting for these draws can be distributed among the players in a valid way. If a valid distribution is found, it prints the total number of draws (p1 - x + p3).
4. **Fallback**: If no valid distribution is found after the iteration, it prints p3 as the number of draws (which seems incorrect based on the logic).

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Total Points Modulo 2**: The check for the sum of points being even is correct.
- **Score Condition Check**: The logic for the condition p3 ≥ p1 + p2 is correct. If this condition holds, the maximum number of draws is indeed p1 + p2.
- **Iterative Check for Draws**: The iterative approach to find the maximum number of draws is correct in principle, but the fallback logic (printing p3 if no valid distribution is found) is incorrect. The correct fallback should be to print -1, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has an incorrect fallback logic. The fallback should print -1 instead of p3 when no valid distribution is found.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program should be modified to print -1 in the fallback case instead of p3.
