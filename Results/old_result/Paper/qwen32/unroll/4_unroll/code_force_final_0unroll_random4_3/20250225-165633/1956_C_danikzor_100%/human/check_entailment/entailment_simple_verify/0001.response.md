### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine whether it correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix and adheres to the constraints.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The maximum possible sum of the matrix can be achieved by ensuring that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix. This can be done by filling each row and each column with a permutation of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The sum of the numbers from 1 to \( n \) is:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

Since each number from 1 to \( n \) appears \( n \) times in the matrix, the total sum of the matrix is:
\[ \text{Total Sum} = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \]

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the value of \( n \).
2. Prints the maximum possible sum and the number of operations (which is \( 2n \)).
3. For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs:
   - A Type 1 operation to fill row \( i \) with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).
   - A Type 2 operation to fill column \( i \) with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).

Let's verify the operations and the calculated maximum sum:

- **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
  The program calculates the maximum sum as:
  \[ \text{Max Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \]

  However, the correct maximum sum should be:
  \[ \text{Max Sum} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \]

  Therefore, the formula used in the program is incorrect.

- **Operations:**
  The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit. However, the operations do not achieve the maximum sum as described above. The operations fill each row and each column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \), but this does not guarantee that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix and the operations do not achieve the maximum possible sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
