To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's systematically analyze the logic and the annotated code against the problem description and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of draws given the scores of three players, with the constraint that the scores are non-decreasing (i.e., \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \)). The total points across all games must be even because each game adds either 2 points (one for a win and one for a draw) or 2 points (both players get 1 point in a draw).

The key points to consider are:
1. **Total Points Check**: The sum of the scores must be even.
2. **Calculating Potential Draws**:
   - `x = (a + b + c) // 2` represents the total number of games played.
   - `y = a + b` represents the minimum number of games that must have involved the players with scores `a` and `b` to achieve their scores.
3. **Determining the Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `x` and `y`.

### Program Analysis

Let's validate the logic step-by-step using the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0`. If true, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible.
   - This check is correct.

3. **Calculating Potential Draws**:
   - `x = (a + b + c) // 2` calculates the total number of games.
   - `y = a + b` calculates the minimum number of games involving the players with scores `a` and `b`.

4. **Determining the Maximum Draws**:
   - The program prints `min(x, y)`, which is the maximum possible number of draws.

### Verification with Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0`, which is even.
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`.
   - Maximum draws: `min(0, 0) = 0`.
   - Output: `0` (Correct).

2. **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2`, which is even.
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`.
   - Maximum draws: `min(1, 1) = 1`.
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct).

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4`, which is even.
   - `x = 2`, `y = 2`.
   - Maximum draws: `min(2, 2) = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct).

5. **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct).

6. **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12`, which is even.
   - `x = 6`, `y = 7`.
   - Maximum draws: `min(6, 7) = 6`.
   - Output: `6` (Correct).

7. **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12`, which is even.
   - `x = 6`, `y = 2`.
   - Maximum draws: `min(6, 2) = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct).

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem's constraints. The logic for checking the total points and calculating the maximum number of draws is sound.

**Final: True**
