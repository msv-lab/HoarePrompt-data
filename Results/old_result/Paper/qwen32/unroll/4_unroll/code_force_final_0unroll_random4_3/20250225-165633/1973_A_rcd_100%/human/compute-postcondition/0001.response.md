To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because the loop iterates `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body, so we do not need to adjust its state.

Given that `t` is the number of test cases and must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` can remain as they are since they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30**
