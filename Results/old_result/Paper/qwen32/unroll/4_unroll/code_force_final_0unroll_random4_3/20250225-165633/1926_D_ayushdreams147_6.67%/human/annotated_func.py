#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique numbers encountered in the list `a` that were not previously seen in terms of their bitwise complements, `count` is a dictionary containing the counts of the bitwise complements of the numbers that were not previously seen, decremented by 1 for each occurrence of the original number.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the number of unique numbers encountered in the list `a` that were not previously seen in terms of their bitwise complements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique numbers in the list `a` that do not have their bitwise complements already present in the list.
