The provided code snippet reads a line of input containing two integers and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers within specific ranges. However, the code snippet only modifies `n` and `k` and does not involve `m` or `t` directly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^6.**
