### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the maximum length of a prefix of string `a` that is a subsequence of string `b` for each test case. The program uses a two-pointer technique with the help of a helper function `func_1` to achieve this. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` and `j` are initialized to 0. These pointers will traverse the strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `c` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j < m` (we haven't reached the end of `b`) and `i < n` (we haven't reached the end of `a`).
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1` is called with the current indices `i` and `j`. This function searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If `a[i]` is found, `func_1` returns the index of this occurrence relative to the start of `b` (`j + index`).
   - If `a[i]` is not found, `func_1` returns -1.

4. **Updating Pointers and Counter**:
   - If `new_j` (the result from `func_1`) is not -1, it means `a[i]` was found in `b` starting from `j`. The program then updates `j` to `new_j + 1` (moving the pointer in `b` to the next character after the found occurrence), increments `i` (moving to the next character in `a`), and increments `c` (since we have found a matching character, the length of the prefix increases by 1).
   - If `new_j` is -1, it means `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from `j`, so the loop breaks, and the current value of `c` is the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints `c`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
   - The program correctly finds that the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is "10" (length 2).

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `a = "100"`, `b = "110"`
   - The program correctly finds that the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is "10" (length 2).

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `a = "1"`, `b = "111"`
   - The program correctly finds that the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is "1" (length 1).

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - `a = "1011"`, `b = "1111"`
   - The program correctly finds that the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is "101" (length 3).

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - `a = "100"`, `b = "11010"`
   - The program correctly finds that the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is "100" (length 3).

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
   - `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`
   - The program correctly finds that the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is "" (length 0).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
