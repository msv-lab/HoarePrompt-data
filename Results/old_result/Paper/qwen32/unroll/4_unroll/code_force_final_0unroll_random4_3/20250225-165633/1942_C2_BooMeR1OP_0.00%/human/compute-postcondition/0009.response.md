The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans` is `x - 2` and `gaps` is an empty list. These states do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so we need to ensure that `x` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`ans` is x - 2, `gaps` is an empty list, `x` must be greater than 0**
