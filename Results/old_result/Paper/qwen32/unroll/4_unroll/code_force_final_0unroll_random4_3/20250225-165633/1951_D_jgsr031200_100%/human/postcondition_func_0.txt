The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1 if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it performs a series of calculations and prints 'YES' followed by 2 and two integers `[n - k + 1, 1]` if a certain condition is met; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
