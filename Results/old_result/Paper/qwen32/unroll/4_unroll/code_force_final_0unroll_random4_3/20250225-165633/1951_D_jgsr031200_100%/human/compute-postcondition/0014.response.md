Postcondition: **n is 0, k remains unchanged, costs remains [n - k + 1, 1], h is k + 1, and h is less than k.**

However, this postcondition presents a logical inconsistency because if `h` is defined as `k + 1`, it cannot simultaneously be less than `k`. Therefore, the if condition `if (h < k)` cannot be true under the given precondition. If we assume there might be a typo or a different interpretation needed, the most accurate postcondition based on the given information would be:

Postcondition: **n is 0, k remains unchanged, costs remains [n - k + 1, 1], h is k + 1. The if condition (h < k) is false under these conditions.**

But strictly adhering to the task and the given if condition, even though it is contradictory:

Postcondition: **n is 0, k remains unchanged, costs remains [n - k + 1, 1], h is k + 1, and h is less than k.**
