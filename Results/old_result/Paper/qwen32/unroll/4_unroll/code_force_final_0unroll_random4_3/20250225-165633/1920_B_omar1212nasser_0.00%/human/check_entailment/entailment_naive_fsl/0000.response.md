Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the given problem description. The main issue lies in the `func_2` function, which contains a hardcoded condition for a specific case (`removals == 6 and negatives == 3`) and does not handle other cases correctly. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Hardcoded Condition**:
   ```python
   if removals == 6 and negatives == 3:
       return 0
   ```
   This condition is incorrect and arbitrary. There's no logical reason for this specific case to always return 0. This is a clear sign that the function is not generalized to handle all possible inputs.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**:
   The function attempts to calculate the possible sums after Alice's removals and Bob's negations, but the logic is flawed. The `pos` list is supposed to store the possible sums after each removal and corresponding negation, but the way it's calculated doesn't consider all possible scenarios.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   The function does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `removals` is greater than or equal to `n`, Alice can remove all elements, making the sum 0. Similarly, if `negatives` is greater than or equal to `n`, Bob can negate all elements. The current implementation does not account for these scenarios correctly.

4. **Incorrect Index Handling**:
   The code tries to access elements beyond the list's bounds, which can lead to incorrect results or exceptions. For example:
   ```python
   n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
   ```
   This line can cause an `IndexError` if `negatives + i` exceeds the length of the list.

To correctly solve the problem, a more generalized approach is needed, considering all possible removals and negations, and calculating the optimal sum based on the players' strategies.

Here is an example of a potential input where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 2
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice can remove the two smallest elements (1 and 2), leaving the array [3, 4, 5].
- Bob can then negate the two smallest elements (3 and 4), resulting in the array [-3, -4, 5].
- The sum of the array is -3 - 4 + 5 = -2.

However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly and may return an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
