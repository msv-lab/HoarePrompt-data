To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and updates the `result` list.

### Explanation of the Loop:
1. **Input Reading**: For each iteration, two integers `x` and `y` are read from the input.
2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1` (which is just `x`).
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`.
   - `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.
3. **Screen Requirement Calculation**:
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
5. **Appending to Result**:
   - If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`.
   - Otherwise, the extra space required is calculated, and the number of additional screens needed is computed and added to `screen_require_for_y`. This total is then appended to `result`.

### Output State:
The `result` list will contain an integer for each test case, representing the number of screens required to accommodate `x` and `y` as described in the loop logic.

### Final Output State:
The output state will be the `result` list after all iterations of the loop have been completed.

Output State: **result is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of screens required for each test case.**
