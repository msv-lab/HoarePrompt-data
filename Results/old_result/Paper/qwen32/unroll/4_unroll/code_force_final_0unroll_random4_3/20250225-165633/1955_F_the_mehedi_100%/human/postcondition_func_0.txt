The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. Specifically, it checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd and increments the result by one if true. Then, it adds half of each count (rounded down) to the result. The function outputs the calculated value for each test case.
