You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then prints `2` if either `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The fireworks from each installation are launched at regular intervals, and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch. The installations launch fireworks every `a` and `b` minutes, respectively.

### Key Points:
1. **Simultaneous Visibility**: We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can overlap in visibility.
2. **Visibility Period**: Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes, from launch time `x` to `x + m`.
3. **Overlap Calculation**: To find the maximum overlap, we need to consider the periods when fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem with the following logic:
- If `m < a` or `m < b`, it prints `2`. This part seems incorrect because it does not consider the actual overlap but assumes that if `m` is less than the launch interval, only two fireworks can overlap.
- Otherwise, it calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation within the visibility period `m` and adds `2` to the sum. This also seems incorrect because it does not account for the correct overlap logic.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of combined fireworks launches. Then, we need to count the number of fireworks visible within a period that includes the maximum overlap. The correct formula involves calculating the number of multiples of `a` and `b` within `m`, and adjusting for overlaps using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

### Correct Formula:
The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

Where:
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor\) is the number of fireworks from the first installation.
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor\) is the number of fireworks from the second installation.
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor\) adjusts for the double-counted fireworks from both installations.
- The `+1` accounts for the initial time point.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
