The code snippet `s = input()` reassigns the variable `s` to the value provided by the user input. The initial state of `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, but after the input operation, `s` will hold whatever string the user provides. The variable `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string provided by user input, `x` is -1.**
