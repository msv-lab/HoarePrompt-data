Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then interprets the first element as the number of test cases (`t`), and the subsequent elements as the container capacities for each test case.
   - However, there's an issue here: the program assumes that all test cases are provided in a single line, which is not the case as per the problem description. Each test case has multiple lines of input.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the total amount of water (`total_water`) and checks if it is divisible by `n` (the number of containers).
   - It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the containers, keeping a running balance (`container`) of the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the running balance becomes negative, it returns 'No', indicating that it's not possible to equalize the water levels using the allowed operations.
   - If the loop completes without the balance going negative, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Logic for Correctness:**
   - The core logic of the program is correct: if, while going through the containers, we ever find that we need to take water from a container that doesn't have enough (i.e., the running balance goes negative), then it's impossible to equalize the water levels using the allowed operations (pouring from left to right only).
   - However, the program does not correctly parse the input for multiple test cases, which is a critical issue.

### Conclusion:
The program contains a significant flaw in how it reads and processes multiple test cases. It assumes all input is provided in a single line, which is not correct according to the problem description. Therefore, the program will not work as intended for inputs with multiple test cases.

**Correctness: False**

### Corrected Input Handling Example:
To fix the input handling, we would need to read the input line by line and process each test case separately. Here's a corrected version of the input handling part:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
