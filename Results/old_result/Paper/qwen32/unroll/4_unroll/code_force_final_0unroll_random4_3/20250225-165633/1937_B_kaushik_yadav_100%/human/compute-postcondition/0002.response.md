The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `t` must ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The states of the binary strings `a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n}` and `a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n}` are not in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
