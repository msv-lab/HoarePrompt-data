Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5; The sum of all `N` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; Additionally, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. It is not the case that (M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1])); `ans` is the binomial coefficient C(N-1, L[-1]-1); `cur` is `M1 - 2`. The condition `M1 > 1` is true.**
