Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to partition a given string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome.
- If such a partition exists, we must print "YES", the number of parts `k`, and the parts themselves.
- If no such partition exists, we must print "NO".

### Program Analysis:

#### Function `func_1(s) -> bool`:
- This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
- It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- This function reads a string `s` from the input.
- It checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
- If `s` is not a palindrome, it immediately prints "YES", the number of parts as `1`, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
- If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character that differs from the first character of the string.
- If no such character is found (meaning the string consists of the same character repeated), it prints "NO".
- If such a character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
- If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
- If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2` (halfway through the string).
- If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Palindromic Strings**: The program only handles the case where the entire string is a palindrome or where the substring after the first differing character is not a palindrome. It fails to consider other valid partitions for palindromic strings.
2. **Partitioning Logic**: The logic for partitioning palindromic strings is flawed. For example, for a string like "abccba", the program might fail to find a valid partition.
3. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the output format correctly for all cases. For example, it prints an extra space in the partitioned substrings.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not guaranteed to find a valid partition for all cases, especially for palindromic strings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
