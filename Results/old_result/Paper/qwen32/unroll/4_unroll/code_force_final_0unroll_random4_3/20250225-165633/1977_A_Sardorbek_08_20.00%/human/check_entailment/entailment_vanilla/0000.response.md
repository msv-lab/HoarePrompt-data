Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add one cube or remove one cube from the tower.

The key observation here is that:
- If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes by adding one cube `m` times.
- If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `n` is greater than `m`, we need to check the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m`. The difference `n - m` must be even because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) results in no net change. If `n - m` is even, it's possible to have `m` cubes by performing `(n - m) / 2` pairs of add-remove moves and then adding `m` cubes.

Now, let's look at the given program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line assigns the tuple (b, c) to q, but q is not used anywhere
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:  # This line checks the parity of a and b, not b and c
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

The issues in the program are:
1. The variable `q` is assigned the tuple `(b, c)` but is never used.
2. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. It should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` to check the parity of `b` (number of moves) and `c` (number of cubes).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic described above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
