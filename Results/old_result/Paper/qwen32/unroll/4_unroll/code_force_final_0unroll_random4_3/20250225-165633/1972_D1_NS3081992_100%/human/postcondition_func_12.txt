The function `func_13` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input. If `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `y` is an integer, `x - a // b * y` is the result of the expression `x` minus the integer division of `a` by `b` multiplied by `y`, and `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `b` and `a % b`.
