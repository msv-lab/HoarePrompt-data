Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The problem requires determining if we can adjust the radii of a set of disks such that:
1. Tangent disks remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of the radii strictly decreases.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii under the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of disks \( n \) is read.
   - For each disk, its center coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) and radius \( r_i \) are read.

2. **DFS Initialization:**
   - Arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients for radius adjustments.
   - `ok` is a flag to determine if a valid adjustment is possible.

3. **DFS Execution:**
   - For each unvisited disk, a DFS is initiated.
   - During DFS, if two disks are tangent (i.e., the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii), the coefficients for radius adjustments are set based on the tangency condition.
   - The DFS continues to explore all tangent disks.

4. **Coefficient Sum Check:**
   - After DFS completes for a connected component of disks, the sum of coefficients `c0` and `c1` is calculated.
   - If `c1` is non-zero, it indicates that a valid adjustment is possible (since `c1` represents the total change in radius that can be applied).

5. **Result Output:**
   - If any connected component of disks allows for a non-zero total change in radius, the program outputs "YES".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables:**
   - The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are defined in `func_1` but are used in `dfs` without being passed as parameters or declared as global. This can lead to undefined behavior or errors.

2. **DFS Function Definition:**
   - The `dfs` function is defined after it is used in `func_1`, which is not a syntax error in Python but can be confusing and should be avoided for clarity.

3. **Logic for Radius Adjustment:**
   - The logic for determining if a valid adjustment is possible seems correct based on the tangency condition and the coefficient sums. However, the implementation details (especially the use of global variables) need to be addressed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when there is only one disk or when all disks are isolated (not tangent to any other disk).

### Correctness:
Given the issues with global variables and the lack of parameter passing in the DFS function, the program is not correctly implemented as is. These issues can lead to incorrect behavior or runtime errors.

**Correctness: False**

To make the program correct, the variables used in `dfs` should either be passed as parameters or explicitly declared as global within the `dfs` function. Additionally, proper handling of edge cases should be considered.
