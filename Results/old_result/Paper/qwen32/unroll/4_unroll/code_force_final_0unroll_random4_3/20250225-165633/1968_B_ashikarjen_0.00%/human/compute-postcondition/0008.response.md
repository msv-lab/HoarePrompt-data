Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The strings `a` and `b` consist only of the characters '0' and '1'. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given binary strings `a` and `b`.**
