### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the game for `k` turns and calculating the scores for both players, Bodya and Sasha. However, the logic in the loop is flawed and does not correctly simulate the game's rules. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores and does not handle the permutation transitions correctly.

Here are the issues with the program:
1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The loop is supposed to simulate `k` turns, but the score updates are done incorrectly inside the loop. The lines:
    ```python
    bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    ```
    do not make sense in the context of the problem. The scores should simply be incremented by the value at the current position for each turn, and the players should move according to the permutation.

2. **Incorrect Movement Handling**: The program updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha correctly by using the permutation array `p`, but it does not handle the scores correctly. The lines:
    ```python
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]
    ```
    should be outside the `max` function and should be the only way scores are updated.

3. **Infinite Loop Risk**: The loop condition `for i in range(n)` is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the loop will run exactly `k` times. It should be `for i in range(k)`.

4. **Initial Score Calculation**: The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are correctly set to `a[b]` and `a[s]`, but the subsequent score calculations are incorrect.

### Corrected Approach:
Here is a corrected version of the loop:
```python
for i in range(k):
    bp += a[b]
    sp += a[s]
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game and calculate the scores based on the rules provided. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
