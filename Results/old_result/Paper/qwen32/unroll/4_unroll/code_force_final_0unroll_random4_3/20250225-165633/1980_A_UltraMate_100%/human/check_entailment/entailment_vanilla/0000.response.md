Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each problem difficulty in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of additional problems needed.
   - It defines a string `p` containing all possible difficulty levels: `'ABCDEFG'`.
   - For each difficulty level `i` in `p`:
     - If the difficulty level `i` is not present in the `Counter` object `hmp` (meaning there are no problems of that difficulty in the bank), it adds `m` to `ans` because `m` rounds are needed, and no problems of that difficulty are available.
     - If the difficulty level `i` is present in `hmp` but the count `hmp[i]` is less than `m` (meaning there are not enough problems of that difficulty for `m` rounds), it adds `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to account for the shortfall.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
- `hmp` = `Counter({'B': 2, 'D': 3, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'G': 1})`
- Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`, `G` (already present, but not enough for `m=1`)
- `ans` = 2 (for `A` and `F`)

**Test Case 2:**
- Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
- `hmp` = `Counter({'B': 2, 'D': 3, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'G': 1})`
- Missing difficulties: `A`, `F`, `G` (already present, but not enough for `m=2`)
- `ans` = 5 (for `A`, `F`, and 2 more `G`)

**Test Case 3:**
- Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
- `hmp` = `Counter({'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2})`
- Missing difficulties: `A`
- `ans` = 1 (for `A`)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided problem description and example.

**Correctness: True**
