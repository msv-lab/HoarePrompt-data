t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, m, k) and two lists (a, b). For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
