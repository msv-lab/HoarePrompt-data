Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` for determining the optimal sum after Alice's and Bob's moves is flawed. Here are some issues and counterexamples:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Removals and Negations**: The code does not correctly account for the optimal combination of removals and negations. For example, it does not consider the possibility of removing some negative numbers or negating some positive numbers to achieve the optimal result.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `s2`**: The variable `s2` is supposed to represent the sum of the largest `negatives + i` elements after `i` removals. However, the code incorrectly updates `s2` by subtracting the `i`-th element from the end and adding the `negatives + i`-th element from the end without properly considering the indices. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle edge cases where `k` or `x` are equal to `n` or `0` correctly. For example, if `k` is `n`, Alice can remove all elements, resulting in a sum of `0`. If `x` is `0`, Bob cannot negate any elements, and the sum should be the sum of the remaining elements after Alice's removals.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 2
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-3
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice can remove the two largest negative numbers, `-1` and `-2`, leaving `[-3, -4, -5]`.
- Bob can then negate the two smallest (most negative) numbers, `-4` and `-5`, resulting in `[-3, 4, 5]`.
- The final sum is `-3 + 4 + 5 = 6`.

However, the provided code will not produce this result because it does not correctly handle the combination of removals and negations.

Thus, the code is incorrect for at least this case, and the correctness is `False`.
