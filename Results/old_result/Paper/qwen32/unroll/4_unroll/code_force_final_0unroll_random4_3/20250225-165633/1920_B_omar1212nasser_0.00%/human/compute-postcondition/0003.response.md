The code snippet initializes an empty list named `pos`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 0 <= removals <= len(elements) and 0 <= negatives <= len(elements). elements is a list of integers. It is not the case that removals is 6 and negatives is 3. pos is an empty list.**
