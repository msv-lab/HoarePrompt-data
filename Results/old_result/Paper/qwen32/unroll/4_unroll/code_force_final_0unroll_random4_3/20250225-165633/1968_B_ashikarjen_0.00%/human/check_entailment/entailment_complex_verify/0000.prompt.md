You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are t test cases where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers representing the lengths of binary strings a and b respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The strings a and b consist only of the characters '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: a is the input string, b is the new input string, n is the length of a, m is the length of the new input string, k is the number of characters from a found in b in order, j is the position in b where the search stopped.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters from the string `a` found in the string `b` in order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines the maximum number of characters from `a` that can be found in `b` in the same order and prints this count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \).

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
```

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is initialized to 0 to count the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0 to track the current position in `b`.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each character in `a` using index `i`.

3. **Inner While Loop**:
   - The inner while loop increments `j` until it finds a character in `b` that matches `a[i]` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - If a match is found (`j < m`), `k` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next position in `b` to continue searching for the next character in `a`.

4. **Break Condition**:
   - If no match is found (`j >= m`), the loop breaks as there are no more characters in `b` to match the remaining characters in `a`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:
1. **First Example**:
   - Input:
     ```
     5 4
     10011
     1110
     ```
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The prefix "10" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`, but "100" is not.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     100
     110
     ```
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The prefix "10" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`, but "100" is not.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1 3
     1
     111
     ```
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The prefix "1" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input:
     ```
     4 4
     1011
     1111
     ```
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The prefix "1" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`, but "10" is not.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3 5
     100
     11010
     ```
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: The entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

6. **Sixth Example**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3 1
     100
     0
     ```
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: There is no "1" in `b`, so no prefix of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty Strings**:
   - If `a` is empty, `k` should be 0.
   - If `b` is empty, `k` should be 0 unless `a` is also empty.

2. **All Characters Match**:
   - If `a` is a subsequence of `b`, `k` should be the length of `a`.

3. **No Matching Characters**:
   - If `a` contains characters not present in `b`, `k` should be 0.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the provided example cases and edge cases. It correctly identifies the maximum prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` by iterating through `a` and finding matches in `b`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**. The program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
