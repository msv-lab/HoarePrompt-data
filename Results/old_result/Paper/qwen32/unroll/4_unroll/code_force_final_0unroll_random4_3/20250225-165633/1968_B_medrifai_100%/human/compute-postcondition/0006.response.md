Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two integer indices `i` and `j`. It returns the position in `b` where the character `a[i]` first appears, starting the search from position `j` in `b`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b` starting from position `j`, it returns -1.**
