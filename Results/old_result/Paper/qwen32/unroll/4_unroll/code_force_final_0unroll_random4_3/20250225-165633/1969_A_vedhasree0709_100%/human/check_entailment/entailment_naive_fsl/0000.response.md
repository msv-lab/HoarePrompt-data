Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and immediately returns 2 if such a pair is found. However, there could be cases where sending invitations to 3 friends is necessary to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Let's consider a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- Friend 1's best friend is Friend 2.
- Friend 2's best friend is Friend 3.
- Friend 3's best friend is Friend 4.
- Friend 4's best friend is Friend 1.

In this scenario, no two friends are each other's best friend directly. Therefore, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 of them come to the party. For example, inviting Friends 1, 2, and 3 would result in Friends 2 and 3 attending the party.

The provided code does not account for such scenarios and incorrectly returns 2 in this case. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
