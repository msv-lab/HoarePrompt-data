The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `c`. The functionality of the function is to handle `t` test cases, each involving a list of integers, and return a specific result for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), followed by a list of `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `c`.**
