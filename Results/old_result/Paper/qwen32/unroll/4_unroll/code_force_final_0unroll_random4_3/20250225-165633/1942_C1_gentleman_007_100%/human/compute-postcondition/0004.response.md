Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements where the first two elements are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `p` is 2.**

In this state, the value of `p` has been set to `2`, while the values and states of `num`, `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime` remain unchanged from the initial state.
