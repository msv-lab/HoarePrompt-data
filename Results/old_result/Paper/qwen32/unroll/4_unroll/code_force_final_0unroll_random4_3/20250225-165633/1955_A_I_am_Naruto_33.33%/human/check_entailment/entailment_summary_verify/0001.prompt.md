You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints the minimum cost for each test case, where the cost is determined based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the individual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.
- **Logic**:
  - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a`.
  - If `n` is greater than 1, we need to consider two scenarios:
    1. **Scenario 1 (Regular Purchase)**: Buying each yogurt at the regular price `a`, resulting in a total cost of `a * n`.
    2. **Scenario 2 (Promotion Purchase)**: Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price `b`, and then buying any remaining yogurt at the regular price `a`. The total cost in this scenario is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
  - The minimum cost is the smaller value between `ans1` (regular purchase) and `ans2` (promotion purchase).

### Program Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates:
  - `ans1` as `a * n` (total cost if buying all yogurts at regular price).
  - `ans2` as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` (total cost if buying pairs of yogurts at promotional price and any remaining yogurt at regular price).
- It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n` is 1, it directly prints `a` as the cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described above and handles all edge cases (e.g., when `n` is 1 or when `n` is even or odd).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
