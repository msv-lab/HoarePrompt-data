### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of determining how many seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position on the grid. The code uses a combination of list comprehensions, cumulative sums, and custom functions to achieve this.

Let's break down the code and see if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the grid string.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Preprocessing:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the length of `pre`.
     - `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of `pre`, starting with 0.
     - `suffZero` is initialized with a single 0.
     - `ans` is initialized as a list of zeros, which will store the final answers for each starting position.
   - **Processing from Right to Left:**
     - The code iterates over the string `s1` from right to left.
     - If the current character is '>', it calculates the answer based on the number of '>' and '<' characters seen so far.
     - If the current character is '<', it updates `suffZero` with the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters.
     - The answer for each starting position is computed using the cumulative sums and specific indices.
   - **Printing the Result:**
     - Finally, the function prints the list `ans`, which contains the answers for all starting positions.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index determined by `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - This function is used to compute specific indices and differences within the cumulative sums.

### Verification:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It efficiently calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position by leveraging cumulative sums and specific indices. The code handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the code correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
