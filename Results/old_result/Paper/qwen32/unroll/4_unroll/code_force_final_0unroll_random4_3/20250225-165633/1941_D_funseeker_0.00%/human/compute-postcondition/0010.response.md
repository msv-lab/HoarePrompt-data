Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c`. `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'. The function returns a set `ans` that is initialized with the value `x`. The function modifies the set `ans` based on the values of `m`, `r`, and `c`, and returns the modified set. The specific modifications depend on the values of `m`, `r`, and `c` as described in the cases.**
