### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (which should be `m` according to the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - It calculates a value `root` as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - It then iterates from `2` to `root + 1`, updating `ans` by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - **Incorrect Variable Naming**: The variable `k` is used instead of `m`. This is a clear error.
   - **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside `func_1()` does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs a series of calculations unrelated to the problem's requirements.
   - **No Pair Checking**: The program does not iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) to check the given condition.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - For each pair, we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition and print the result for each test case.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
