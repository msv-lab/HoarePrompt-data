Let's evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to create a graph with `n` vertices using distinct integers from 1 to `n` for each vertex. Edges are added between vertices `(i, j)` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and output the vertex assignments, the number of cliques, and the partition.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`
- **Initialization**: The function initializes `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros. However, the problem requires `arr` to contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- **Clique Calculation**: The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which might not be optimal. The problem requires the minimum number of cliques.
- **Array Population**: The function calls `make_array` to populate `arr` and `cliquess`, but since `arr` and `cliquess` are global variables, the function modifies these global arrays directly.

#### Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`
- **Global Variables**: The function uses global variables `arr` and `cliquess`.
- **Array Population**: The function fills `arr` with a sequence of increasing and decreasing values and assigns the `clique` value to `cliquess`. However, this does not guarantee that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `make_array` but does not address the issues with global variables and the logic for array population.

### Issues Identified
1. **Global Variables**: The use of global variables `arr` and `cliquess` can lead to undefined behavior and incorrect results.
2. **Incorrect Array Initialization**: `arr` is initialized with zeros, which is incorrect as it should contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
3. **Incorrect Calculation of Clique Size**: The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which may not be optimal.
4. **Incorrect Array Population**: The logic in `make_array` does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
5. **Output Format**: The code prints the results directly within the function, which is not the expected behavior.
6. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `k` is large relative to `n`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is **correct**. The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. The use of global variables, incorrect array initialization, suboptimal clique calculation, and incorrect array population logic are significant problems that need to be addressed.

**Final**: **False**
