The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `pos`. The value being appended is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `elements`, and `sum(elements[-negatives:])` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

Given that `pos` was initially an empty list, after the code execution, `pos` will contain one element, which is the result of the calculation mentioned above.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is a list containing one element, which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. `s` is the sum of the integers in `elements`.**
