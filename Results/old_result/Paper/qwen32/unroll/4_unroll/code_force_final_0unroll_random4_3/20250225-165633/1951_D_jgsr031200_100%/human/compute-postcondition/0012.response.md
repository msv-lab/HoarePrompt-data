The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `costs`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `costs` has at least one element for the loop to execute. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.

The list `costs` is already defined with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers and `n` is not equal to `k`, `n - k + 1` is a positive integer, ensuring that the list `costs` has at least one element.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the list `costs` to ensure the loop executes. The loop will iterate over the elements in `costs`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is 0.**
