You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Given the trace of a string `s`, which is an array `a` of integers where each `a_i` represents the number of previous occurrences of the character `s_i` in `s`, the task is to reconstruct such a string `s` using lowercase Latin letters.

### Key Points:
1. The trace array `a` is given.
2. We need to reconstruct the string `s` such that the trace of `s` matches `a`.
3. The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters.
4. Multiple valid strings `s` may exist for a given trace `a`; any valid one is acceptable.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program initializes a string `a` containing all lowercase Latin letters ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz').
2. It also initializes a list `b` of size 26, filled with zeros. This list will keep track of the number of times each letter has been used so far.
3. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `s`.
   - It initializes an empty string `r` to build the result.
   - For each element `i` in the trace array `s`:
     - It finds the index `x` of the first occurrence of `i` in the `b` list.
     - It appends the corresponding letter from the `a` string (based on the index `x`) to the result string `r`.
     - It increments the count of that letter in the `b` list.
   - It prints the resulting string `r`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Finding the Index in `b`**: The `b.index(i)` call finds the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`. However, this does not necessarily correspond to the letter that should be used next. For example, if `b` is `[0, 0, 1]` and `i` is `0`, `b.index(0)` will return `0`, but the correct letter might be 'b' (index `1`), not 'a' (index `0`), because 'a' has already been used once.
2. **Incrementing Counts**: The program correctly increments the count of the chosen letter in the `b` list, but the choice of which letter to use is flawed due to the incorrect index lookup.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly reconstruct the string `s` from the trace array `a`. The choice of letters based on the first occurrence of a count in the `b` list is incorrect and can lead to invalid results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
