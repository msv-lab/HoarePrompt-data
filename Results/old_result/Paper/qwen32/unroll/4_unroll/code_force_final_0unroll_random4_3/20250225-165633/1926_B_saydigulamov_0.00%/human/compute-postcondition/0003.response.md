The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 100`. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that `2 <= n <= 10`, and an `n x n` grid which is a list of strings. Each string in the grid consists of `n` characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up entirely of '1's, and this shape has a size greater than 1. 

The function returns:
- Case_1: The area of the triangle or square made up of '1's in the grid.
