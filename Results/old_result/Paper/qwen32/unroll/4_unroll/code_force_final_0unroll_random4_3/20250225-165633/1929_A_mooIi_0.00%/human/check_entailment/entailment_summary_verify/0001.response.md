### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the beauty, which is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements (i.e., \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \)).
   - The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order because this arrangement maximizes the positive differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `ar`.
   - It sorts the list `ar` in ascending order.
   - It then prints the sorted list as a space-separated string.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the program: it sorts the list and prints it.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not compute the beauty; instead, it prints the sorted list.
   - It provides a corrected version of the program that calculates and prints the beauty.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - The original program does not solve the problem as described. It sorts the array but does not calculate the beauty.
   - The original assessment is accurate in pointing out the error and providing a corrected version.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
