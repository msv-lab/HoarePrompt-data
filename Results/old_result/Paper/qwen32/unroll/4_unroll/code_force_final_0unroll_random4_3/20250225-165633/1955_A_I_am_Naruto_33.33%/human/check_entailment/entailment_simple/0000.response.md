### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts during a promotion is `b` burles.
   - The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - `ans1` calculates the total cost if each yogurt is bought individually, i.e., `a * n`.
     - `ans2` calculates the total cost if the promotion is used as much as possible:
       - `b * n // 2` calculates the cost for the maximum number of pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
       - `a * n % 2` calculates the cost for any remaining single yogurt.
     - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a` since there's no pair to buy.

3. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **First Test Case:**
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`
     - Minimum cost is `9`.
   - **Second Test Case:**
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
     - Minimum cost is `15`.
   - **Third Test Case:**
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 21`
     - Minimum cost is `15`.
   - **Fourth Test Case:**
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
     - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 0 = 22`
     - Minimum cost is `20`.

The program correctly handles the logic for both scenarios where `n` is greater than 1 and when `n` is 1, and it calculates the minimum cost accurately in all provided examples.
