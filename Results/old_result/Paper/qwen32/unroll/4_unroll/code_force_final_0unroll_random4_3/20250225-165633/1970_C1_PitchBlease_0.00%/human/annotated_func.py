#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 \(\leq\) n \(\leq\) 2 \(\times\) 10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v in the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v in the tree, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and `tree` is a `defaultdict` with lists as default values that now contains adjacency lists for each node, representing the connections between nodes as defined by `edges`.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the shortest path distances from a starting node to two leaf nodes in a tree. It accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of the tree, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. The function returns 'Ron' if at least one of the shortest paths from the starting node to any two leaf nodes has an even length; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.
