To determine the output state, we need to consider the given conditions and the calculation specified in the return statement.

Initial State:
- `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers.
- If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is 3 or greater.

Return Statement:
```
return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
```

Let's break this down:

1. **If `extroverts` is divisible by 3:**
   - The remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 is 0.
   - The sum of the remainder (0) and `universals` is `universals`.
   - The return value is `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

2. **If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3:**
   - The remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 is a non-zero value (1 or 2).
   - The sum of this remainder and `universals` is 3 or greater.
   - The return value is `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

In both cases, the return value is the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3. Given that `universals` compensates for the remainder when `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, ensuring the sum is 3 or greater, the ceiling function will round up to the nearest integer.

Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**
