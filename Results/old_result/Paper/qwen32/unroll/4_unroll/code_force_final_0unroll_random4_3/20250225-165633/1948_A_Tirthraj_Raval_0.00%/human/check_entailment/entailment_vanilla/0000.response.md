Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Logic to Determine Special Characters:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters always come in pairs in such a string (e.g., in "AA", 'A' at position 2 is special because it is equal to its neighbor 'A' at position 1, and vice versa).
   - If `n` is even, the program proceeds to construct a string.

3. **String Construction:**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a pattern using the characters 'A' and 'B'.
   - It appends 'A' and 'B' alternately in pairs to ensure that each 'A' and 'B' has exactly one neighbor that is the same, thus making them special characters.
   - The pattern is repeated `n // 2` times to ensure there are exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Output:**
   - If `n` is even, the program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Odd `n`:** The program correctly identifies that it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters and returns "NO". This is correct based on the problem's definition of special characters.
  
- **Even `n`:** For even `n`, the program constructs a valid string by alternating 'A' and 'B' in pairs. This ensures that each 'A' and 'B' has exactly one neighbor that is the same, making them special characters. The number of special characters in the constructed string is exactly `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a suitable string can be constructed and correctly constructs such a string when possible.

**Correctness: True**
