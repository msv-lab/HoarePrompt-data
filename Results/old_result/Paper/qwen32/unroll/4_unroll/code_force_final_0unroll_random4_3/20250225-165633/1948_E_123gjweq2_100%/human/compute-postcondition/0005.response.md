To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the loop and see how the variables change.

### Initial State Recap
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop runs `mid` times, and in each iteration `i`:
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is set to `small_element + i`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.

Let's analyze the changes:
1. **Array `arr`**:
   - The loop sets `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `small_element + i` for `i` ranging from `0` to `mid - 1`.
   - This means the `mid` elements starting from `arr[left + mid - 1]` going backwards to `arr[left]` will be set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 each step.

2. **Array `cliquess`**:
   - The loop sets `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique` for `i` ranging from `0` to `mid - 1`.
   - This means the `mid` elements starting from `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` will all be set to `clique`.

### Output State
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
- `clique` remains unchanged.
- `small_element` remains unchanged.
- `big_element` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `not_mid` remains unchanged.
- `arr` will have `mid` elements starting from `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
- `cliquess` will have `mid` elements starting from `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` set to `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`; `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`; `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are set to `clique`.**
