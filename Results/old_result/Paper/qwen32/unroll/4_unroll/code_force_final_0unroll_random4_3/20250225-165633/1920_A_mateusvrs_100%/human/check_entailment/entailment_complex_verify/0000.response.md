### Reasoning:

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints on the integer \( k \). The constraints are processed to determine the valid range of \( k \) values and then exclude any values specified by type 3 constraints. Here is a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and verification against the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cx` is a set that stores values that \( k \) cannot be (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large number (1000000000.0 + 7) to find the minimum \( k \) (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to find the maximum \( k \) (type 1 constraints).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program updates `ax`, `bx`, or adds to `cx` based on the constraint type:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (\( k \geq x \)), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (\( k \leq x \)), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and \( x \).
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (\( k \neq x \)), it adds \( x \) to the set `cx`.

3. **Calculating Valid \( k \) Values:**
   - If `bx` (maximum \( k \)) is greater than `ax` (minimum \( k \)), it means there are no valid \( k \) values, so the answer is 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total possible values between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, subtracting the values in `cx` that fall within this range.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases and constraints correctly:

1. **Edge Case: No Overlapping Range:**
   - If the maximum \( k \) from type 1 constraints is greater than the minimum \( k \) from type 2 constraints, there are no valid \( k \) values.
   - Example: \( k \geq 5 \) and \( k \leq 4 \).
   - The program correctly identifies this as an impossible case and returns 0.

2. **Edge Case: Only One Valid \( k \) Value:**
   - If the maximum \( k \) from type 1 constraints equals the minimum \( k \) from type 2 constraints and no type 3 constraints exclude this value.
   - Example: \( k \geq 5 \) and \( k \leq 5 \).
   - The program correctly identifies this as a single valid value and returns 1 if no exclusions are present.

3. **Edge Case: Multiple Type 3 Constraints:**
   - If multiple values are excluded by type 3 constraints, these should be subtracted from the total range.
   - Example: \( k \geq 1 \), \( k \leq 10 \), \( k \neq 3 \), \( k \neq 7 \).
   - The program correctly calculates the number of valid values by excluding the specified values.

4. **Edge Case: Large Range:**
   - The program should handle large ranges efficiently.
   - Example: \( k \geq 10000 \), \( k \leq 900000000 \).
   - The program correctly calculates the number of valid values within the large range.
