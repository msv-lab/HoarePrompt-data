The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over is `a`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0. The state of `a` is the only one we need to adjust based on the loop head.

Given that `a` is described as an input integer, it is likely that `a` represents the number of iterations or some related quantity from the input description, but the loop itself only cares about whether `a` is greater than 0 to determine if it should execute.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0**
