### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description and the execution summary.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1.
   - It then reads the permutation list `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - `bp` and `sp` are initialized to the values of `a` at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - `bm` and `sm` are initialized to the potential scores if both players stayed at their starting positions for all `k` turns.

3. **Simulation of Moves:**
   - The program simulates `k` turns of the game.
   - In each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation list `p`.
   - It updates the scores `bm` and `sm` by adding the values from the array `a` at the new positions.
   - The code seems to have an incorrect logic to accumulate scores. `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect as they do not correctly simulate the game rules. The scores should simply be accumulated by adding the value at the new position `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.
   - Furthermore, the initial score multiplication by `k` is also incorrect because it assumes the players stay in their positions for all `k` turns which is not the case. The scores should be accumulated based on the actual moves.

4. **Determination of the Winner:**
   - After simulating the game, the program correctly compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The logic for score calculation and position updates is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
