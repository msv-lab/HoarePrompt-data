The code snippet calculates the value of `not_mid` based on the current values of `right`, `left`, and `mid`. The value of `mid` is already defined as `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`.

The expression for `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`. Substituting the value of `mid` into this expression, we get `not_mid = right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2`. This expression calculates the number of elements not in the middle when the elements between `left` and `right` are split into two parts around the middle.

The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, and `mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.**
