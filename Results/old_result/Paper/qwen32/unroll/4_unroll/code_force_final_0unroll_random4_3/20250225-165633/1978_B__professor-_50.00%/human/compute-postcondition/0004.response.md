Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the corresponding results.**
