Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern as described in the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the number of ships sunk by the Kraken, but it does so in a way that does not accurately reflect the alternating attack pattern (first ship, last ship, first ship, etc.).

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
5 7
3 2 1 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
1. Attack the first ship (3 -> 2)
2. Attack the last ship (2 -> 1)
3. Attack the first ship (2 -> 1)
4. Attack the last ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 5 sinks
5. Attack the first ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 1 sinks
6. Attack the last ship (4 -> 3)
7. Attack the first ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 2 sinks

So, the ships that sink are 1, 2, and 5, which totals 3 ships.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will not produce the correct output because it does not simulate the alternating attack pattern correctly. The logic in the function `func_1` incorrectly attempts to sum the durability from both ends separately and compare it to half of the total attacks, which does not match the problem's requirements.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case and potentially for others as well.
