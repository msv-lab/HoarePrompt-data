The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is between 0 and 2^31 - 1. It then performs operations on the list and prints the result for each test case, which is the count of unique elements after a specific transformation involving bitwise XOR with 2^31 - 1.
