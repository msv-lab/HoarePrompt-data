To ensure that the given for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- **`n`**: This is the upper bound of the range (exclusive), and it is determined by the input. The loop will iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- **`i`**: This is the loop variable that starts at 1. The initial value of `i` is automatically set by the `range` function and does not need to be explicitly adjusted before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be considered for the loop to execute is `n`. It must be at least 1. The value of `i` is managed by the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be at least 1**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once for each test case.
