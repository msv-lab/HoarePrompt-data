Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left. The core issue lies in the logic used to determine the output based on the counts of the favorite value in the sorted list.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for "YES" and "NO"**:
   - The program checks if the number of removed cubes with the favorite value (`removed_count`) is equal to the total number of cubes with the favorite value (`favorite_count`). If they are equal, it prints "YES". This logic is incorrect because the favorite cube could still be in the list even if some cubes with the same value are removed.
   - Similarly, if `removed_count` is 0, it prints "NO". This is also incorrect because it does not consider the possibility that the favorite cube could be removed if it appears later in the sorted list.

2. **Incorrect Logic for "MAYBE"**:
   - The program prints "MAYBE" if `removed_count` is neither equal to `favorite_count` nor 0. This logic is flawed because it does not accurately reflect the conditions under which the favorite cube might be removed or not.

To fix these issues, we need to correctly determine the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list and compare it with the number of cubes removed (`k`).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        favorite_index = sorted_a.index(favorite_value)
        if favorite_index < k:
            print('YES')
        elif favorite_index >= n - k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We find the index of the favorite value in the sorted list.
- If the index is less than `k`, it means the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes and will be removed, so we print "YES".
- If the index is greater than or equal to `n - k`, it means the favorite cube is among the last `n - k` cubes and will not be removed, so we print "NO".
- Otherwise, the favorite cube could be either removed or not, so we print "MAYBE".
