To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and check if it accurately identifies when it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations.

### Analysis of the Problem

The problem states that we can select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them with that color. The goal is to determine if we can make the entire grid one single color.

### Key Observations

1. **Single Color Rows/Columns**: If there is a row or column where all elements are the same color, then you can color the entire grid that color by selecting pairs of squares from that row or column.

2. **First and Last Rows/Columns**: If the first and last rows are different, and the first and last columns are different, then it might be impossible to make the entire grid one color because there would be at least two different colors in the first and last rows/columns that can't be unified.

3. **Single Color Grid**: If the grid is already a single color, then the answer is trivially "YES".

### Analysis of the Program

The program reads the grid and checks two conditions:
- If the first row is a single color and is different from the last row, it prints "NO".
- If the first column is a single color and is different from the last column, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Check

Let's consider the two conditions in the program:
- The first condition checks if the first row is a single color and different from the last row. If this is true, then the grid cannot be made uniform because there are two different colors represented in the first and last rows.
- The second condition checks if the first column is a single color and different from the last column. If this is true, then the grid cannot be made uniform because there are two different colors represented in the first and last columns.

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. For example, if the first row and last row are different but the first column and last column are the same, the program would incorrectly print "YES" even if the grid cannot be made uniform.

### Counterexample

Consider the following grid:
```
WB
BW
```
This grid cannot be made uniform because the first row and the last row are different, and the first column and the last column are different. However, the program would incorrectly print "YES" because the first row is not a single color and the first column is not a single color.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all cases and can incorrectly print "YES" for grids that cannot be made uniform. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
