You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` will receive a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively, followed by a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The function will process each test case independently.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: A series of integers, each representing the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (where `n` is the number of problems in the bank, ranging from 1 to 50, and `m` is the number of upcoming rounds, ranging from 1 to 5), and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The function processes each test case independently and returns the results based on the given criteria.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
