The value of `ans` is set to the value of `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^6; `ans` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^6; `ans` is equal to `n`.**
