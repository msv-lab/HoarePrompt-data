You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and checks if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd) to print 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem description. Let's go through the logic:

1. If `b == c`, the program correctly outputs "YES" because if the number of moves `n` is equal to the number of cubes `m`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve `m` cubes.
2. If `b < c`, the program correctly outputs "NO" because if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes since each move can only add or remove one cube.
3. The next condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves. This condition should actually check if the difference between the number of moves `b` and the number of cubes `m` is even, i.e., `elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:`. This is because the only way to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves is if the difference between `n` and `m` is even (since each move changes the number of cubes by 1, an even number of moves is required to reach a specific count from another count).

Let's consider an example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
3 3
2 4
5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
No
Yes
```

**Program Output:**
```
Yes
NO
No
```

The output for the third test case is incorrect. The program outputs "No" instead of "Yes" because it incorrectly checks `a % 2 == b % 2` (which translates to `3 % 2 == 5 % 2` or `1 == 1`, which is true, but the program should check `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` which is `2 % 2 == 0` or `0 == 0`, which is true).

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
