You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a permutation of the first `n` natural numbers. It then reverses the elements at even indices (considering 0-based indexing) while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged. The modified permutation is printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
- The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)).

### Program Analysis:
The given program is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
```

### Explanation of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case separately.
2. **Creating the Permutation:** For each test case, it creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
3. **Reversing Even Indices:** It reverses the elements at even indices in the list `a`. This is done using slicing (`a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`).
4. **Output:** It prints the modified list `a` as the permutation.

### Checking the Permutation:
Let's check if the generated permutation meets the criteria of the problem description. We need to ensure that there do not exist indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

#### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Generated Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Check:
     - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide any other element in the list.
     - \( p_2 = 1 \) divides \( p_4 = 3 \), but \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_5 \) (out of bounds).
     - \( p_3 = 2 \) divides \( p_4 = 3 \), but there is no \( p_5 \) (out of bounds).
     - No two pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exist such that both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
   - Conclusion: This permutation is valid.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3`
   - Generated Permutation: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Check:
     - \( p_1 = 1 \) divides \( p_2 = 2 \) and \( p_3 = 3 \), but \( p_2 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 3 \) and vice versa.
     - No two pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exist such that both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
   - Conclusion: This permutation is valid.

### General Case:
Let's consider a general case to see if the permutation logic holds. The program reverses the elements at even indices, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern between consecutive elements. For any \( n \geq 3 \), the generated permutation seems to avoid the condition where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of specific test cases and the general logic of the program, it appears that the program generates a valid permutation for any \( n \geq 3 \) that satisfies the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program generates a permutation by reversing elements at even indices, which ensures that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) exist such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \). This logic is consistent across the provided test cases and appears to hold for any \( n \geq 3 \).
