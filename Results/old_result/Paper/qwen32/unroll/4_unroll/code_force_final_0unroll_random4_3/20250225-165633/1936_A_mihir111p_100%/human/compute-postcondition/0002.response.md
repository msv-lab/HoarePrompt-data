Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which must be within the range from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive), where `n` is the length of a secret permutation. The function returns the result of a comparison between the bitwise OR of the elements at indices `a` and `b` in the permutation and the bitwise OR of the elements at indices `c` and `d`.**
