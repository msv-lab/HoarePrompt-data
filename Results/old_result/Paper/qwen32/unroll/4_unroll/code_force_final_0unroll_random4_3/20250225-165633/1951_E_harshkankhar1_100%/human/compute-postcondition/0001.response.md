The code assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n` and reassigns `-1` to the variable `x`. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is provided by user input. The variable `x` is reassigned to `-1`, which is the same value it had initially, so this reassignment does not change its value effectively. The Output State reflects these changes.

Output State: **`s` is a string provided by user input, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is -1.**
