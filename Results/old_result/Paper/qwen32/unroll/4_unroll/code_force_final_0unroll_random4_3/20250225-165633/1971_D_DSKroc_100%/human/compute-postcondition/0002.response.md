To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
        if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print(count + 1)
    else:
        print(count)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, meaning it will process `t` different strings `s`.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each string `s`, the inner loop iterates through the characters of `s` from the first to the second last character.
3. **Count and Flag Variables**:
   - `count` is incremented whenever the current character is different from the next character.
   - `flag` is set to 1 if any character is less than the next character.
4. **Print Statement**:
   - If `flag` is 0 (meaning no character is less than the next character, i.e., the string is non-increasing), it prints `count + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `count`.

### Output State:
Given that the loop processes `t` strings, the output state will be a series of `t` printed values, each depending on the respective string `s` processed in each iteration.

Since the code does not modify the value of `t` or `s` outside the loop, the state of `t` and `s` after the loop remains the same as their initial state. However, the output will be a sequence of `t` printed values.

Output State: **a sequence of t printed values, each representing the count of transitions between different characters plus one if the string is non-increasing.**
