Precondition: **i is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk. visited, nodes, coef0, and coef1 are lists used to keep track of visited disks, nodes in the current DFS traversal, coefficients for radius adjustments, and their signs, respectively. n is the total number of disks.**
