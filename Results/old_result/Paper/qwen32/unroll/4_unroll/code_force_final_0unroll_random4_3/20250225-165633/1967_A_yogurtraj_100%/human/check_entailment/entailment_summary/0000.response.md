### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum score one can achieve by rearranging cards after potentially purchasing additional cards from a shop. The score is defined as the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` (number of distinct card types), `k` (number of coins to buy new cards), and a list `a` representing the initial count of each card type.
3. It sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
4. It iteratively checks if it can level up the counts of card types by using the available coins `k`. The goal is to make the counts of card types as equal as possible.
5. If at any point the remaining coins `k` are insufficient to level up the next card type, it calculates the maximum possible count `r` for the current level and the remaining coins `rem`.
6. Finally, it computes the maximum score based on the final counts of card types and prints the result.

The correctness of the program can be verified by analyzing its logic against the problem requirements:
- The program correctly sorts the initial counts of card types.
- It iteratively levels up the counts of card types using the available coins `k`.
- It handles the case where there are still coins left after leveling up all card types.
- It correctly calculates the maximum score based on the final counts of card types.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct logic and produce the expected results for the sample test cases.
