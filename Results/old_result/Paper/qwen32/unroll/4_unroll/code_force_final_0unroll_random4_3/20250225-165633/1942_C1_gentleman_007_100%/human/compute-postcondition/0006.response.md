Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `l` of integers. It returns a 2D list `p` of integers with dimensions `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, where each element `p[i][j]` is the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner (0,0) to (i-1,j-1) in `l`. The first row and the first column of `p` are initialized to `0`.**
