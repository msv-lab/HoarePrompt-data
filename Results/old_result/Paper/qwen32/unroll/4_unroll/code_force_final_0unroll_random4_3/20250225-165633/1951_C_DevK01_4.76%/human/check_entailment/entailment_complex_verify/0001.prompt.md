You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day (`m`), the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and the price per ticket for each day. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased each day.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with the goal of minimizing the total cost. The constraints are:
- On any given day, you can buy up to `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Program Analysis

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum number of tickets you can buy in one day `m`, and the total number of tickets `k` to be bought.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices for each day, `a`.

2. **Constraints Adjustment:**
   - `m` is adjusted to be the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure we do not attempt to buy more tickets in a single day than we need to buy in total.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list of ticket prices `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because buying tickets on the days with the lowest prices first will minimize the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the number of days needed to buy all `k` tickets, assuming `m` tickets are bought each day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list of prices. These are the days with the lowest prices.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If the total number of tickets bought in `q` days is exactly `k` (i.e., `q * m == k`), the cost is calculated using a specific formula involving the sum of the selected prices and the incremental cost due to the price increase.
   - If `k` tickets cannot be bought exactly in `q` days (i.e., `q * m > k`), the program adjusts the last day's purchase to buy only the remaining tickets needed (`mu = k - (q - 1) * m`) and recalculates the cost.

### Issues in the Program

The program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The formulas used to calculate the cost are incorrect. The incremental cost due to the price increase is not correctly accounted for.
   - The program does not properly handle the scenario where the number of tickets bought in `q` days exceeds `k`.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the cost for the last day when `k` tickets cannot be bought exactly in `q` days.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The approach of selecting the first `q` days and then adjusting the last day's purchase is not optimal. It does not guarantee the minimum cost.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
