### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it calls `func_1`. Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (which should be `m`), initializes `ans` to `n`, and then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` plus one, adding to `ans` the value of \((n + i) // (i * i)\).

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k`, computes a value `ans` based on `n`, and prints the result. The computation involves adding to `n` the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n` plus one.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Parameter Handling**: The function reads `n` and `k` instead of `n` and `m`. This is a minor issue since `k` is used in the computation, but it should be `m`.
2. **Logic Mismatch**: The provided code does not seem to implement the logic required by the problem statement. The code is computing something related to divisors and sums, but it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's consider the provided test case:
```
1
2 3
```
**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
- \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\)
- \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\)

Now, let's run the provided code with this input:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)

# Simulating the input
input_data = "2 3"
from io import StringIO
import sys

sys.stdin = StringIO(input_data)
func_1()
```
**Output:**
```
3
```
The output is `3`, which matches the expected output for this test case. However, this does not necessarily mean the code is correct for all test cases, but it does challenge the original assessment that the code is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. The fact that it produces the correct output for the provided test case does not guarantee its correctness for all possible inputs. The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment appears to be accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
