Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but interacts with a system to determine two indices i and j of a secret permutation p such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The function can send up to 3n queries per test case in the form "? a b c d" to receive comparisons of bitwise OR operations on elements of the permutation. The function returns the indices i and j that maximize p_i âŠ• p_j.**
