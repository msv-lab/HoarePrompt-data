You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 500 inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: a series of t outputs, each being either -1 or a calculated result based on the scores of the three players.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores (p_1, p_2, p_3) of players. For each test case, it calculates and prints either -1 if the sum of the scores is odd, or a calculated result based on the scores if the sum is even.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws based on the given scores and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Program

The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players.
3. It checks if the total score `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even since each game results in an even sum of points (either 0+2, 2+0, or 1+1).
4. If the total score is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` and prints the result.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Input:** `0 0 0`
   - Total score: `0` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `(0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `0 1 1`
   - Total score: `2` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `(0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1 1 1`
   - Total score: `3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `1 1 2`
   - Total score: `4` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `(1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Input:** `3 3 3`
   - Total score: `9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Input:** `3 4 5`
   - Total score: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `(3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6`
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Input:** `1 1 10`
   - Total score: `12` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `(1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Edge Case Consideration

Let's consider a few more edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly:

1. **Input:** `0 0 2`
   - Total score: `2` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `(0 + 0 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `0 2 2`
   - Total score: `4` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `(0 + 2 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 0 - 2)) // 2 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `2 2 4`
   - Total score: `8` (even)
   - Maximum draws: `(2 + 2 + 4 - max(0, 4 - 2 - 2)) // 2 = 4`
   - Output: `4` (Correct)

### Conclusion

After analyzing the provided test cases and additional edge cases, the program appears to correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all valid inputs and correctly identifies invalid score sets by returning `-1` when the total score is odd.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all given test cases and additional edge cases, ensuring it calculates the maximum number of draws accurately and returns `-1` for invalid score sets.
