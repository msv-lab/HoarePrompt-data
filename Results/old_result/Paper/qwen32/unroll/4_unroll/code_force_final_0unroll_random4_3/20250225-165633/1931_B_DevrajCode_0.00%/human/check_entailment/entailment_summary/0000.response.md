Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. Calculate the total amount of water across all containers.
2. Check if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it would be impossible to distribute the water equally, and the function would return 'No'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant and not actually performed in the code.
3. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total amount of water divided by `n`.
4. Iterate through the list of containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
5. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that it is not possible to redistribute the water from the previous containers to the current one to reach the target amount without violating the operation constraints (i.e., pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`). In such a case, the function returns 'No'.
6. If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, it means that it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, and the function returns 'Yes'.

The logic of the program is correct based on the problem constraints and requirements. The program efficiently checks the possibility of equal distribution by ensuring that the cumulative water deficit does not exceed the available water surplus in previous containers.

Correctness: **True**
