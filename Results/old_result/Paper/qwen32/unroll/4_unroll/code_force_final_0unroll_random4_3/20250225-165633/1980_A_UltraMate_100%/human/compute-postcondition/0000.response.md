The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer input `t` which represents the number of test cases. This does not affect the initial state of the test cases themselves, but it does introduce a new variable `t`.

Output State: **The function `func` will receive a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively, followed by a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The function will process each test case independently. `t` is the number of test cases.**
