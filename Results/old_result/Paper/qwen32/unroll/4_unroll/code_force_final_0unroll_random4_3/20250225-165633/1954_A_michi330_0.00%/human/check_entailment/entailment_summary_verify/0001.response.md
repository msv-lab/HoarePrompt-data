Let's analyze the program and function summary in detail to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice wants to paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Number of parts in the ribbon, `n`.
   - Number of colors available, `m`.
   - Maximum number of parts Bob can repaint, `k`.
3. **Conditions**:
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to one color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - If `m == 1`, Bob can always repaint the ribbon to one color, so the answer is `NO`.
   - If `n > k` and `m > 1`, Alice can potentially paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color.

### Program Analysis:
The given program checks:
1. If `n <= k`, it prints `NO` because Bob can repaint all parts.
2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints `NO`.
3. Otherwise, it prints `YES`.

Let's break down the second condition:
- `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts that must have the same color if the ribbon is painted in a way that minimizes the maximum number of parts of the same color.
- `n - math.ceil(n / m)` gives the number of parts that can be painted in different colors from the most frequent color.
- If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can repaint enough parts to match the most frequent color, so the answer is `NO`.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the sample inputs:
1. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - `n <= k` is `True`, so the answer is `NO`.
2. **Input**: `5 1 1`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - `m == 1` is `True`, so the answer is `NO`.
3. **Input**: `5 2 1`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
   - `n > k` and `m > 1` is `True`, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2` which is not less than `k`, so the answer is `YES`.
4. **Input**: `5 2 2`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
   - `n > k` and `m > 1` is `True`, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2` which is equal to `k`, so the answer is `NO`.
5. **Input**: `5 5 3`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
   - `n > k` and `m > 1` is `True`, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4` which is greater than `k`, so the answer is `YES`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program. It states that the function determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color. The conditions in the program are correctly implemented to check:
1. If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts.
2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to match the most frequent color.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
