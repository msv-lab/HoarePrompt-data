The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a rectangle's dimensions (`h`, `w`) and the coordinates of two distinct points (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`). It then determines and prints the result for each test case, which can be "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw", based on the relative positions of the points within the rectangle.
