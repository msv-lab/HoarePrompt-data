You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Program:

import math

for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    (a, b) = (math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2)
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `k`, an integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers. It returns `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integers in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns `ans`, which is the total number of times the cumulative sums from the start (`s_a`) and from the end (`s_b`) of the list `nums` are less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and `b` (which is `k // 2`), respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and the last ship until it has attacked `k` times or all ships have sunk. Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1. We need to determine how many ships have sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the number of sunk ships. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program does:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - Read the durability list `nums` for the ships.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k, nums)`:**
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all durabilities, all ships will sink, so return `n`.
   - Calculate `a` as the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` as `k // 2`. These represent the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively.
   - Initialize `ans` (number of sunk ships) to 0.
   - Initialize `s_a` and `s_b` to 0. These will accumulate the total durability of the ships attacked from the start and end, respectively.
   - Iterate through the ships:
     - Add the durability of the current ship from the start to `s_a`. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, increment `ans` (indicating the ship has sunk).
     - Add the durability of the current ship from the end to `s_b`. If `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, increment `ans` (indicating the ship has sunk).

### Issues with the Program:
The provided program has a significant flaw in its logic. The program does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern of the Kraken. Instead, it tries to determine the number of sunk ships by comparing cumulative sums of durability to `a` and `b`, which does not accurately reflect the alternating nature of the attacks.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the number of sunk ships, we need to simulate the alternating attack pattern of the Kraken. This involves:
- Iterating through the ships and reducing their durability based on the attack pattern.
- Removing ships from the list once their durability drops to 0.
- Continuing the process until `k` attacks have been made or all ships have sunk.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
