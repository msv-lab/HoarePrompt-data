The code snippet `n, m, x = func_3()` indicates that the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are being reassigned based on the return values of the function `func_3()`. The initial state of `n`, `m`, and `x` are no longer relevant as they are directly overwritten by the output of `func_3()`. The variables `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are reassigned to the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set initialized with the value `x`, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.**
