### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. 

The solution provided in `func_1` works as follows:
1. It first sorts the array to get `sorted_a`.
2. It then creates a concatenated version of the array `concatenated_a` by concatenating the array with itself.
3. It checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`. If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

The idea behind this approach is valid. When you concatenate the array with itself, you essentially create all possible rotations of the array. By checking if any of these rotations match the sorted version of the array, you can determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation.

The function `func_2` handles reading the input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results. This part of the code is also correct and follows the problem's input-output requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
