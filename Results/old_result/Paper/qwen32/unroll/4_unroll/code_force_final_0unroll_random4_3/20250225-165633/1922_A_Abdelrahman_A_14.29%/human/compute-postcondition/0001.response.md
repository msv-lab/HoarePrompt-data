In the provided `for` loop, the loop will iterate based on the value of `tests`. The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the variable `tests`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `tests` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once. 

The variable `i` is the loop counter and is initialized automatically by the `range` function, so we do not need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `tests` is the integer input representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.

The only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `tests`. To make sure the loop executes at least once, `tests` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is at least 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters**.
