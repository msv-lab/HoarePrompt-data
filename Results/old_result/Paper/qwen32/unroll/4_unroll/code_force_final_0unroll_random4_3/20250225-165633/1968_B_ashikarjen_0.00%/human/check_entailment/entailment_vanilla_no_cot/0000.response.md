To determine if the provided program is correct, let's analyze its logic step by step against the problem description and the example inputs.

The problem requires finding the maximum possible number \( k \) such that the prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \).

Here's the provided program:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization**:
    - `k` is initialized to 0. It will track the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
    - `j` is initialized to 0. It will be used to traverse string `b`.

2. **Outer Loop**:
    - The outer loop iterates over each character in string `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`).

3. **Inner Loop**:
    - The inner `while` loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m` (the length of `b`) and the current character in `b` (at index `j`) does not match the current character in `a` (at index `i`).
    - If a match is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), `k` is incremented to indicate that one more character of `a` has been matched as a subsequence in `b`. Then, `j` is incremented to move to the next character in `b`.

4. **Break Condition**:
    - If the inner `while` loop exits because `j` has reached `m` (meaning the rest of `b` does not contain the current character of `a`), the `else` block is executed, and the loop breaks. This means no more characters of `a` can be matched as a subsequence in `b`.

5. **Output**:
    - Finally, the program prints the value of `k`, which is the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Testing the Program:

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
    - Input:
        ```
        5 4
        10011
        1110
        ```
    - Output:
        ```
        2
        ```
    - Explanation: '10' is a subsequence of '1110', but '100' is not.

2. **Second Example**:
    - Input:
        ```
        3 3
        100
        110
        ```
    - Output:
        ```
        2
        ```
    - Explanation: '10' is a subsequence of '110', but '100' is not.

3. **Third Example**:
    - Input:
        ```
        1 3
        1
        111
        ```
    - Output:
        ```
        1
        ```
    - Explanation: '1' is a subsequence of '111'.

4. **Fourth Example**:
    - Input:
        ```
        4 4
        1011
        1111
        ```
    - Output:
        ```
        1
        ```
    - Explanation: '1' is a subsequence of '1111', but '10' is not.

5. **Fifth Example**:
    - Input:
        ```
        3 5
        100
        11010
        ```
    - Output:
        ```
        3
        ```
    - Explanation: '100' is a subsequence of '11010'.

6. **Sixth Example**:
    - Input:
        ```
        3 1
        100
        0
        ```
    - Output:
        ```
        0
        ```
    - Explanation: '1' is not a subsequence of '0'.
