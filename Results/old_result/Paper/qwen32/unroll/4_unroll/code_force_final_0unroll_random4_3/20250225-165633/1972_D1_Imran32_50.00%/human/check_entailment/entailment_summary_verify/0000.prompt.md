You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, computes a value `ans` based on `n`, and prints the result. The computation involves adding to `n` the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n` plus one. The function does not return any value explicitly but outputs the computed `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. The code appears to be attempting to solve a different problem or has a logical error in the implementation.

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the given code does not properly address these conditions. Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. The function `func_1()` is incorrectly named and does not take the parameters `n` and `m` correctly.
2. The variable `k` is used instead of `m` in the input parsing.
3. The logic inside the loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To demonstrate the incorrectness, let's consider a simple test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
- \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\)
- \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\)

The provided code does not produce the correct output for this test case or any other test cases that I can think of. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Incorrect Output for the Test Case:**
The code will not produce the correct output for the given test case, indicating that the logic is flawed.
