You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum length of consecutive segments in the list `a` where all elements in a segment are the same. If no such segment exists or the entire list is a single segment, it prints `-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve this by:
1. Iterating through each test case.
2. For each array, it tries to find the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements.
3. If the minimum length of such a segment is `inf` (which should not happen as the array is beautiful) or the length of the array itself (meaning the entire array consists of the same element), it outputs `-1`.
4. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of the segment.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Finding Minimum Segment Length**: The program incorrectly calculates the minimum length of a segment of identical elements. It does not correctly handle the case where the last segment of identical elements is the shortest, as it only updates `minn` when it encounters a different element.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array is already not beautiful correctly. However, since the problem guarantees that the input array is beautiful, this is not an issue for the given problem constraints.
3. **Final Update for `minn`**: The program correctly updates `minn` with the last segment length after the loop, but the logic for determining the minimum length of a segment of identical elements is flawed.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for finding the minimum segment length, the program is incorrect. It does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

### Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, one approach would be to correctly identify the minimum length of segments of identical elements and handle the edge cases properly. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Correctness: **False**
