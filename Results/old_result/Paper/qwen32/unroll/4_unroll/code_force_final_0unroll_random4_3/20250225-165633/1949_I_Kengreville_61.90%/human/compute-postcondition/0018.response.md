Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but operates on the global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. It processes `n` disks defined by their centers `(x[i], y[i])` and radii `r[i]`, and uses the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists to manage the state and results of the processing. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists as part of its operation.**
