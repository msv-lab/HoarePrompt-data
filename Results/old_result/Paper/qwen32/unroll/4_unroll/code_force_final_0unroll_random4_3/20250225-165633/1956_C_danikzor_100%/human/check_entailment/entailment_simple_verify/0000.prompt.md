You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

def func_1():
    n = int(input())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n x n matrix. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the size of the n x n matrix for each test case)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: For each test case with integer `n`, the output consists of `2 * n` lines. Each pair of lines for `i` from 1 to `n` is `1 i n n-1 ... 2 1` followed by `2 i n n-1 ... 2 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix based on the allowed operations. The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \), which is correct for the maximum sum achievable. However, the operations it performs to achieve this sum are incorrect.

The program performs Type 1 and Type 2 operations with a descending permutation for each row and column, but this does not necessarily lead to the maximum sum. The operations should be designed to place the highest possible numbers in the matrix while adhering to the constraints of the problem.

Let's consider a simple counterexample:

For \( n = 2 \):

- The maximum sum is \( 7 \), which can be achieved by setting the matrix as:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  3 & 2 \\
  2 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

- The program's operations would be:
  - Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation [2, 1]
  - Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation [2, 1]
  - Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation [2, 1]
  - Type 2 operation on column 2 with permutation [2, 1]

  This results in the matrix:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  which has a sum of \( 6 \), not \( 7 \).

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum for all cases, making it incorrect.
