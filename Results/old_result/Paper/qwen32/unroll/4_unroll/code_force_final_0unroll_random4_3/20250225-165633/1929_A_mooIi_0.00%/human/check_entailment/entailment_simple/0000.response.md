Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints it, without calculating the beauty of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Calculate the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
3. Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

The provided program outputs the sorted array instead of the beauty of the array. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
