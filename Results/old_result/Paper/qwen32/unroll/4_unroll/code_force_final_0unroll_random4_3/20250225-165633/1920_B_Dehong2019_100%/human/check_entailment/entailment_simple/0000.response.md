### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of both Alice and Bob based on the provided rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in descending order. Sorting helps in easily identifying the largest and smallest elements.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial sum of the array `ans1` which is the sum of all elements in the sorted array.

3. **Bob's Optimal Move**:
   - Bob's goal is to minimize the sum. If Bob can flip `x` elements to negative, he would flip the `x` largest elements (since they are sorted in descending order).
   - The program adjusts `ans1` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements (since flipping a positive number `a[i]` to negative reduces the sum by `2 * a[i]`).

4. **Alice's Optimal Move**:
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the sum. She can remove at most `k` elements.
   - The program iterates over all possible numbers of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `k`).
   - For each possible number of elements removed, it updates the sum by adding back the `i`-th element (which was previously subtracted twice by Bob) and subtracting twice the `i + x`-th element (if it exists) because Bob can flip it to negative.
   - It keeps track of the maximum sum achievable (`ans2`).

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum sum achievable after both players have made their optimal moves.

### Correctness:

The program correctly simulates the optimal moves of both players by leveraging the sorted order of the array. It ensures that Alice maximizes the sum by removing the smallest elements and Bob minimizes the sum by flipping the largest elements to negative. The logic for updating the sum based on the number of elements removed by Alice and flipped by Bob is sound.

**Correctness: True**
