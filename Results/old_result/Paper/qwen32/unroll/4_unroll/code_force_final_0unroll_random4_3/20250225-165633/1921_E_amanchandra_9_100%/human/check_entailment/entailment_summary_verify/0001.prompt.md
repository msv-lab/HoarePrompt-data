You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a rectangle's dimensions (`h`, `w`) and the coordinates of two distinct points (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`). It then determines and prints the result for each test case, which can be "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw", based on the relative positions of the points within the rectangle.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the described problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Alice's Moves**:
   - Can move down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Alice wins if she reaches Bob's position.
   - Alice cannot move if she is already in the last row.

2. **Bob's Moves**:
   - Can move up, up-left, or up-right.
   - Bob wins if he reaches Alice's position.
   - Bob cannot move if he is already in the first row.

3. **Game Outcome**:
   - If Alice is initially in a row greater than Bob's row, Alice cannot win because she can't move up.
   - If they are in the same row, the game is a draw because neither can move towards each other.
   - If Alice is in a row less than Bob's row, the game's outcome will depend on the columns and the number of rows separating them.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - If `x_a > x_b`, Alice cannot win because she cannot move up, so the game is a draw.
   - If `x_a == x_b`, Alice and Bob are in the same row, so the game is a draw.
   - If `x_a < x_b`, the game's outcome depends on the columns and the number of rows separating them:
     - `x = abs(a - c) // 2` calculates half the number of rows separating Alice and Bob.
     - If the number of rows separating them is odd, the program calculates the range of columns Bob can be in to block Alice from reaching him in the next move.
     - If the number of rows separating them is even, the program calculates the range of columns Alice can be in to block Bob from reaching her in the next move.
     - The program then checks if Alice or Bob can block each other based on these ranges and prints the winner accordingly.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly handles the cases where Alice is in a row greater than or equal to Bob's row.
- The logic for determining the winner when Alice is in a row less than Bob's row seems flawed. The conditions to check if Alice or Bob can block each other do not correctly account for all possible scenarios.
- For example, the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` for odd row differences and `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` for even row differences do not correctly determine the game's outcome.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed logic in the blocking conditions, the program does not always produce the correct outcome.

Correctness: **False**
