Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the rules of movement (i.e., moving one or two cells at a time, and not landing on thorns). Instead, it simply counts the number of coins ('@') in each test case and prints that count, regardless of the movement rules.

Here is a specific case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
5
.@*@@
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
Explanation: Starting from the first cell, you can move to the second cell (which has a coin), but you cannot move to the third cell (which has thorns). Therefore, the maximum number of coins you can collect is 1.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```
Explanation: The program incorrectly counts the number of coins ('@') in the path, which is 2, without considering the thorns and movement rules.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
