### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- The program should read an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it should read two integers `x` and `y`.
- It should output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

**Annotations:**
- The program reads `t` but does not use it.
- It reads exactly 10 test cases regardless of the value of `t`.
- It stores the values of `x` and `y` in lists and then prints the minimum and maximum for each pair.

**Original Assessment:**
- The program is incorrect because it is hardcoded to read and process exactly 10 test cases, which does not align with the problem description where `t` can be between 1 and 100.

**Evaluation Based on Annotations:**
- The annotations confirm that the program reads exactly 10 test cases, which is a direct contradiction to the problem description where the number of test cases can vary.
- The annotations do not indicate any logic errors in determining the minimum and maximum of each pair `x` and `y` once the pairs are read.
- The core issue lies in the hardcoded loop that limits the number of test cases to 10, irrespective of the value of `t`.

**Conclusion:**
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the varying number of test cases as specified by `t`. It is hardcoded to process only 10 test cases, which makes it incorrect for any value of `t` other than 10.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
