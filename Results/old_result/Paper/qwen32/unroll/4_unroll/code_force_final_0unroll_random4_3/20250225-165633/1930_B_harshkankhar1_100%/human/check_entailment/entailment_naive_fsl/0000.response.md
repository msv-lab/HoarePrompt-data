Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
- The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)).

### Program Analysis:
The given program is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
```

### Explanation of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case separately.
2. **Creating the Permutation:** For each test case, it creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
3. **Reversing Even Indices:** It reverses the elements at even indices in the list `a`. This is done using slicing (`a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`).
4. **Output:** It prints the modified list `a` as the permutation.

### Checking the Permutation:
Let's check if the generated permutation meets the criteria of the problem description. We need to ensure that there do not exist indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

#### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Generated Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Check:
     - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide any other element in the list.
     - \( p_2 = 1 \) divides \( p_4 = 3 \), but \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_5 \) (out of bounds).
     - \( p_3 = 2 \) divides \( p_4 = 3 \), but there is no \( p_5 \) (out of bounds).
     - No two pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exist such that both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
   - Conclusion: This permutation is valid.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3`
   - Generated Permutation: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Check:
     - \( p_1 = 1 \) divides \( p_2 = 2 \) and \( p_3 = 3 \), but \( p_2 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 3 \) and vice versa.
     - No two pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exist such that both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
   - Conclusion: This permutation is valid.

### General Case:
Let's consider a general case to see if the permutation logic holds. The program reverses the elements at even indices, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern between consecutive elements. For any \( n \geq 3 \), the generated permutation seems to avoid the condition where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of specific test cases and the general logic of the program, it appears that the program generates a valid permutation for any \( n \geq 3 \) that satisfies the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program generates a permutation by reversing elements at even indices, which ensures that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) exist such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \). This logic is consistent across the provided test cases and appears to hold for any \( n \geq 3 \).
