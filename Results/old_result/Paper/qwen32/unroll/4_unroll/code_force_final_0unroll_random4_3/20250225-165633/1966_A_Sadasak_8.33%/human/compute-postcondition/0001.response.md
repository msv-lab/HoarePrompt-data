In the given task, the for loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which represents the current element in the list during each iteration. The other variables `arr`, `k`, and `frequency_table` are not directly part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`arr`**: The loop iterates over `arr`, so `arr` must be a list with at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. **`num`**: This variable is automatically assigned by the loop to each element in `arr` during each iteration, so there's no need to adjust its state before the loop starts.
3. **`k`**: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect whether the loop executes.
4. **`frequency_table`**: This variable is also not part of the loop head and does not affect whether the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must contain at least one element. The other variables do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop's execution.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and must have at least one element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.
