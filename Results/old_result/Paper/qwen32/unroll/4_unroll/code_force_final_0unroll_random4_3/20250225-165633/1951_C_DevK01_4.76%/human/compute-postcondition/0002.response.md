To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the input state.

The loop processes `t` test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the prices of tickets for each day.
2. It then calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets by selecting the cheapest tickets available over the days, considering the limit `m` on the number of tickets that can be bought each day.
3. The cost calculation involves sorting the ticket prices and then selecting the cheapest tickets in chunks of up to `m` tickets until `k` tickets are bought.
4. Finally, it prints the total cost for each test case.

The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices `M` are modified within the loop, but after all iterations, the only state that remains relevant is the printed output for each test case. Since the loop prints the cost for each test case, the output state will be the sequence of costs printed for each test case.

Given that the loop processes `t` test cases and prints a cost for each, the output state will consist of `t` printed costs.

Output State: **the sequence of costs printed for each of the t test cases.**
