To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration and how the output is generated.

### Loop Breakdown:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` is read, representing the size of the `n x n` matrix.

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - A matrix `mat` of size `n x n` is created where each row is initialized with numbers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Result Calculation:**
   - A variable `res` is initialized to `0`.
   - A loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, and in each iteration, `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `res` and `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`) are printed.
   - Two nested loops run from `i = n` to `i = 1`:
     - In each iteration, two lines are printed:
       - The first line starts with `1` followed by `i` and the numbers from `1` to `n`.
       - The second line starts with `2` followed by `i` and the numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Output State Analysis:

For each test case, the following outputs are generated:
- A single line with the result `res` and `2 * n`.
- `2 * n` lines with the specified format.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to consider the final state of the output, which is the sequence of all outputs generated for each test case.

### Output State:

The output state is a sequence of outputs for each test case. For each test case:
1. A line with the result `res` and `2 * n`.
2. `2 * n` lines with the specified format.

Given the format of the question, we can describe the final output state as follows:

Output State: **A sequence of outputs for each test case, where each test case outputs a line with `res` and `2 * n`, followed by `2 * n` lines with the specified format.**

This describes the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.
