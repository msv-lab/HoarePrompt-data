To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and ensure that it correctly counts the number of good subsegments of array `a` for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the length of array `a`, the length of array `b`, and the required number of matching elements, respectively.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `todo` is initialized as a set containing all elements of array `b`.
   - `done` and `extra` are initialized as empty sets. `done` will store elements from the current subsegment of `a` that are also in `b`, and `extra` will store elements from the current subsegment of `a` that are not in `b`.

3. **First Subsegment Processing**:
   - For the first subsegment of length `m` in `a`, it iterates through the elements.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is moved from `todo` to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - It checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and sets `ans` to 1 if true, otherwise 0.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - For each subsequent subsegment, it slides the window one element to the right.
   - It removes the element that is no longer in the window (`old`).
     - If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
     - If `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
   - It adds the new element that enters the window (`a[r]`).
     - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is moved from `todo` to `done`.
     - If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - It checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and increments `ans` if true.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments for a test case, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Analysis:

- The program uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subsegments.
- It maintains the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to keep track of elements in the current window.
- The logic for moving elements between `todo`, `done`, and `extra` as the window slides is correct.
- The condition to check if a subsegment is good (i.e., if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`) is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` for each test case as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
