Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It returns a value indicating the outcome based on the scores. Case_1: If all scores are equal, it returns "draw". Case_2: If `p_3` is greater than the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`, it returns "player3_wins". Case_3: If neither of the above conditions is met, it returns "no_clear_winner".**
