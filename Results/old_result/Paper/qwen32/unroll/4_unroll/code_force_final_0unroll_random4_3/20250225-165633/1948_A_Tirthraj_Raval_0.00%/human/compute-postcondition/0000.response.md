Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 50 inclusive. The condition for `n` in the test cases remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input of `t`.
