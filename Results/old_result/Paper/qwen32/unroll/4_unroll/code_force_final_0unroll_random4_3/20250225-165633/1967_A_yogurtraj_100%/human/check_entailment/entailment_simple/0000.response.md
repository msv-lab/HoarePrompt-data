### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum score we can achieve by rearranging the cards such that the score is the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` which are a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. We can buy up to `k` new cards to help achieve this.

The provided program follows a strategy to maximize the score by ensuring that all `n` types of cards have as equal a count as possible, given the constraint of `k` additional cards. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of distinct card types) and `k` (number of coins), followed by a list `a` of `n` integers representing the counts of each card type.

2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This helps in determining the minimum number of cards needed to make all counts equal.

3. **Distributing Coins**: The program iterates through the sorted list to see how many coins `k` are needed to make all counts up to the current card type equal to the count of the next card type. If at any point the required coins exceed `k`, it calculates the new maximum count `r` that can be achieved with the available coins and computes the remaining coins `rem` and the number of card types `y` that can be incremented by one.

4. **Final Calculation**: After distributing the coins, the program calculates the maximum score based on the final counts of the cards. If `k` is not fully used, it means all card types have been made equal, and the remaining coins are distributed evenly among the card types to maximize the score.

5. **Output**: The program prints the maximum score for each test case.

The logic used in the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by ensuring that the counts of card types are as equal as possible, given the constraint of `k` additional cards. The program handles the edge cases, such as when `k` is zero or when all card types already have equal counts.
