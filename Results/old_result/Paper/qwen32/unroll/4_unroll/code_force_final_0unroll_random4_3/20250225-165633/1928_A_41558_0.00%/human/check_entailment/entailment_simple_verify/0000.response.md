Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotations and the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He tries to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles by rotating and moving them as he wishes. Two rectangles that differ only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Annotations:
- **State before function call**: `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`.
- **Inside the loop**: `a` and `b` are read as integers.
- **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:`
  - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program outputs "NO".
- **Condition 2**: `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`
  - If one dimension is exactly half of the other, the program outputs "NO".
- **Else Case**:
  - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program outputs "YES".

### Evaluation of Conditions:
1. **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:`
   - **Reasoning**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in two rectangles with at least one dimension being odd, and it is impossible to rearrange them into a new rectangle with integer sides that is different from the original. This condition is correct.
   
2. **Condition 2**: `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`
   - **Reasoning**: If one dimension is exactly half of the other, the resulting rectangles will have one dimension that is half the other, and it is impossible to rearrange them into a new rectangle with integer sides that is different from the original (e.g., cutting a `6x3` rectangle results in two `3x3` rectangles, which can only form a `6x3` rectangle). This condition is correct.
   
3. **Else Case**:
   - **Reasoning**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it means the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This condition is correct based on the problem description.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 1`
  - Both dimensions are odd, so the output is "NO". Correct.
- **Test Case 2**: `a = 2, b = 1`
  - One dimension is even and the other is odd, and one is not half of the other, so the output is "NO". Correct.
- **Test Case 3**: `a = 2, b = 6`
  - One dimension is not half of the other, so the output is "YES". Correct.
- **Test Case 4**: `a = 3, b = 2`
  - One dimension is not half of the other, so the output is "YES". Correct.
- **Test Case 5**: `a = 2, b = 2`
  - Both dimensions are even and one is half of the other, so the output is "YES". Correct.
- **Test Case 6**: `a = 2, b = 4`
  - One dimension is exactly half of the other, so the output is "NO". Correct.
- **Test Case 7**: `a = 6, b = 3`
  - One dimension is exactly half of the other, so the output is "NO". Correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided test cases. There are no edge cases that seem to be missed based on the problem description and the given examples.

**Final: True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all the described scenarios. If both dimensions are odd, it returns "NO". If one dimension is exactly half of the other, it returns "NO". In all other cases, it returns "YES", which aligns with the problem description.
