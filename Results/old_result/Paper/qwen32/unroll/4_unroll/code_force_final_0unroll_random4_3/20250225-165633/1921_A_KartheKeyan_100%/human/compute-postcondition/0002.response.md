In this task, the `while` loop condition is `while n:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and `0` is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

- **State right before the while loop**: 
  - There are `t` test cases where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
  - For each test case, `l` is an integer read from input.
  - `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2` and printed.
  - `n` is assigned the value from the input.
  - The coordinates `x_i, y_i` remain unchanged.

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The value of `n` must be non-zero.

### Final State:
State: **There are `t` test cases where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. For each test case, `l` is an integer read from input, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2`, and printed. `n` is a non-zero integer. The coordinates `x_i, y_i` remain unchanged.**

This state ensures that the `while n:` loop can execute at least once.
