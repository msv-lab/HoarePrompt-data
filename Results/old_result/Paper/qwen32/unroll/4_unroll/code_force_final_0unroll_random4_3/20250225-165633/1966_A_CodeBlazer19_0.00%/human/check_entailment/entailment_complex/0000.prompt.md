Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. The list of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n represents the numbers written on the cards and each c_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be `k - 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `l` will be different for each test case based on the input, but the output for each test case will specifically be the value of `k - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. It then prints `k - 1` for each test case.
