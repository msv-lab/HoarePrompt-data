Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Additionally, for each of the k moves, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
