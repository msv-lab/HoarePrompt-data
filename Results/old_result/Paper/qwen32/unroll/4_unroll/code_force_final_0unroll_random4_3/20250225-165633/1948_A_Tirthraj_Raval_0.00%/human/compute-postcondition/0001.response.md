For the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. This means the only variable we can adjust is `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 50`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 50, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, to adhere to the format and ensure clarity, we can state that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be at least 1**
