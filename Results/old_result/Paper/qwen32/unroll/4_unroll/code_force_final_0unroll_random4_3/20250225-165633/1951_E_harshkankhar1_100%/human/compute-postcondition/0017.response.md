Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the exact output.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a string provided by user input.
2. `n` is the length of `s`.
3. `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
4. `i` is the index of the first differing character, and it is the same as `x`.
5. `x` is not equal to -1, meaning there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
6. The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
```

### Explanation:
- `s[:x + 1]` will print the substring of `s` from the beginning up to and including the index `x`. This means it will include the first character and all characters up to the first differing character.
- `s[x + 1:]` will print the substring of `s` starting from the character immediately after the first differing character up to the end of the string.

### Example:
Let's assume `s` is the string "aaaaabbb". Here's how the variables would be set:
- `s[0]` is 'a'.
- `x` is 4 (since 'b' at index 4 is the first character different from 'a').
- `s[:x + 1]` would be "aaaaa".
- `s[x + 1:]` would be "bbb".

### Output:
Based on the above explanation, the print statement will output the first part of the string up to and including the first differing character, followed by a space, and then the rest of the string starting from the character immediately after the first differing character.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring of s from the start to the first differing character, and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character after the first differing character to the end of s)**

However, to make it more precise and in the requested format:

Output: **s[:x + 1]  s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring of s from the start to and including the first differing character, and s[x + 1:] is the substring of s from the character after the first differing character to the end of s)**

To make it even more concrete with an example, if `s = "aaaaabbb"`:

Output: **aaaaa  bbb**
