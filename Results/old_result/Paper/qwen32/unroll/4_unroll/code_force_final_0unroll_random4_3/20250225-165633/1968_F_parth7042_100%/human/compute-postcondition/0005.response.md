The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The variable `t` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the loop will execute because `t` is already within the valid range for the loop to run. The variables `data`, `index`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**
