Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; each constraint is described by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2; no two constraints are the same; `r` is an empty list.**

The variable `r` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
