### Reasoning:
The original assessment provides a thorough breakdown of the problem and the program's logic. Let's re-evaluate the key points to ensure the program is indeed correct:

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve an odd total with the given scoring rules.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - **Case 1**: When `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is because if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws is the sum of the smaller two scores. This is a valid logical deduction.
   - **Case 2**: When `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates the range of possible draws between `low` and `high` and checks for a valid number of draws (`cur`) such that the remaining scores after accounting for draws are feasible. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining scores are achievable.

3. **Testing the Program**:
   - The program is tested with several examples, and it produces the expected output for each case.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call**: The program reads multiple test cases, each with three scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` where `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- **Total Points Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
  - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws is the sum of the smaller two scores.
  - **Case 2**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` and iterates to find a valid number of draws. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining scores are feasible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem's logic. The annotations and the original assessment provide a clear and accurate explanation of the program's behavior.

**Final: True**
