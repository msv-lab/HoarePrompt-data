The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints. For each test case, it calculates and returns the number of integers within a specified range that are not explicitly listed as constraints of type 3. The range is determined by the maximum value of constraints of type 1 and the minimum value of constraints of type 2.
