Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted integer scores representing the scores of three players. For each test case, it determines and prints a value based on the scores: `-1` if the sum of the scores is odd, `p1 + p2` if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, or a calculated value derived from balancing the scores otherwise.**
