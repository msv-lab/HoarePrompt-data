Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` representing the numbers written on the cards. The function returns the count of numbers in the list that are divisible by `k` for each test case.**
