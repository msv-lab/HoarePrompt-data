You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n). Each integer in the sublist satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function receives an additional parameter n, which is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, there are m queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and each query consists of two integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city in each test case, the closest city is uniquely determined.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: prog_cities is a list of n-1 elements where each element is either 1 (if the next city is closer) or the distance to the next city (if the previous city is closer).
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains `n-1` elements where each element is either 1 (if the next city is closer) or the distance to the next city (if the previous city is closer).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `cities` which is a list of lists containing the coordinates of cities in ascending order for each test case, and `n` which is the number of test cases. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum travel cost for each city to its closest neighboring city and returns a list `prog_cities` containing `n-1` elements. Each element in `prog_cities` is either `1` if the next city is closer or the distance to the previous city if the previous city is closer.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains `n-1` elements where each element is either 1 (if the next city is closer) or the distance to the next city (if the previous city is closer).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
