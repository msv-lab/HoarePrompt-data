Let's carefully analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph of tangent disks. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads `n`, the number of disks.
   - It then reads the coordinates `(x, y)` and radius `r` for each disk.

2. **DFS Initialization:**
   - `visited`: A list to keep track of which disks have been visited.
   - `coef0` and `coef1`: Coefficients used to represent the relationship between the radii of tangent disks.
   - `nodes`: A list to keep track of nodes (disks) in the current connected component of tangent disks.

3. **DFS Execution:**
   - For each disk `i` that hasn't been visited:
     - It initializes the coefficients `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]`.
     - It starts a DFS from this disk.
     - After the DFS, it sums up the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the connected component.
     - If the sum of `coef1` is not zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `ok` is `True`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program attempts to determine if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii decreases while maintaining tangency.
- However, the logic to determine this is flawed. The program checks if the sum of `coef1` is not zero, but this does not directly correlate to whether the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's requirements.
- The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent the relationship between the radii of tangent disks, but the program does not correctly use these coefficients to determine if the radii can be adjusted in the desired manner.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the requirements is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
