To determine the final state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the given loop and how it modifies the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, and the sets and variables used within the inner loop.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
   - There are constraints given as pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9.
   - `r` is an empty list.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration, `n` (the number of constraints) is read from the input.
   - `cx` is initialized as an empty set.
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (1000000007).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs `n` times.
   - For each constraint (a, x):
     - If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a` is 3, `x` is added to the set `cx`.
   - After the inner loop, the code checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`:
     - If `bx > ax`, 0 is appended to the list `r`.
     - Otherwise, a temporary variable `tmp` is initialized to 0. For each element `i` in `cx`, if `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is incremented by 1. Finally, `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is appended to the list `r`.

4. **Output State**:
   - After all iterations of the outer loop, the list `r` will contain `t` elements, each determined by the constraints provided in each iteration.
   - The variables `t`, `n`, and the constraints themselves do not change after the loop ends.

Given the above analysis, the output state is simply the final state of the list `r` after all iterations of the loop have completed. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the constraints) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Output State: **r is a list of integers where each integer is determined by the constraints provided in each iteration of the outer loop.**
