Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game and determine the final score. Here's why:

1. The program simply looks for the first missing integer in the array and prints it, which does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their respective strategies to maximize or minimize the MEX.

2. Alice and Bob take turns, and Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program does not simulate the turns or take into account the optimal moves each player would make.

3. The logic in the program does not handle the game dynamics correctly. For example, if there are multiple instances of the same number, the program should consider how Alice and Bob would play to reach the optimal MEX.

To solve the problem correctly, one needs to simulate the game considering the optimal moves of both players. Here's a corrected approach:

- Count the occurrences of each number in the array.
- Determine the smallest number that appears an odd number of times.
- The MEX will be this number if it exists, otherwise, it will be the smallest number that does not appear in the array.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        mex = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if mpp[i] % 2 == 1:
                mex = i
                break
        print(mex)

func()
```

This version correctly determines the MEX by considering the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
