To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t):`. The only variable we can adjust is `t` to ensure the loop executes.

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, `s`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
