Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Path Construction**: The program does not correctly construct the lexicographically smallest path. It only considers the possibility of switching to the second row when the element in the second row is smaller than the next element in the first row. However, it does not handle the scenario where the element in the second row is smaller than the current element in the first row. This can lead to incorrect paths being chosen.

2. **Counting Paths**: The program's logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is also incorrect. It only counts the number of consecutive positions where the elements in both rows are the same or where a '0' in the first row can be followed by a '1' in the second row. This does not account for all possible paths that can yield the smallest string.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:

- Use dynamic programming to determine the lexicographically smallest path. This involves maintaining a state that keeps track of the smallest string possible up to each cell and the number of ways to achieve that string.
- Carefully handle the transitions between rows and columns to ensure that the smallest possible string is constructed.
- Count all paths that lead to the smallest string by maintaining a count of the number of ways to reach each state.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        
        # Initialize dp arrays
        dp_min = [['', 0] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp_min[0][0] = ('', 1)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Option 1: Move right in the first row
            if dp_min[i - 1][0] + a[i - 1] < dp_min[i][0]:
                dp_min[i][0] = dp_min[i - 1][0] + a[i - 1]
                dp_min[i][1] = dp_min[i - 1][1]
            elif dp_min[i - 1][0] + a[i - 1] == dp_min[i][0]:
                dp_min[i][1] += dp_min[i - 1][1]
            
            # Option 2: Move down from the first row to the second row
            if i == 1 or dp_min[i - 1][0] + b[i - 1] < dp_min[i][0]:
                dp_min[i][0] = dp_min[i - 1][0] + b[i - 1]
                dp_min[i][1] = dp_min[i - 1][1]
            elif i == 1 or dp_min[i - 1][0] + b[i - 1] == dp_min[i][0]:
                dp_min[i][1] += dp_min[i - 1][1]
            
            # Option 3: Move right in the second row
            if i > 1 and dp_min[i - 1][0] + b[i - 1] < dp_min[i][0]:
                dp_min[i][0] = dp_min[i - 1][0] + b[i - 1]
                dp_min[i][1] = dp_min[i - 1][1]
            elif i > 1 and dp_min[i - 1][0] + b[i - 1] == dp_min[i][0]:
                dp_min[i][1] += dp_min[i - 1][1]
        
        print(dp_min[n][0])
        print(dp_min[n][1])

func()
```

This corrected program uses dynamic programming to ensure that the smallest lexicographical path is found and counts all paths that yield this path.
