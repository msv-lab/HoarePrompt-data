To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `i < n` is true right before the loop starts. The variables `i` and `n` are the only ones involved in the loop condition.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of only '0' and '1'.
- `counter` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

The condition `i < n` must be true for the loop to execute. Since `i` is initially 0, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is already constrained to be between 1 and 10^5, this condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` or `i` to ensure the loop can execute the first time. The state right before the loop is already sufficient for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of only '0' and '1', `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
