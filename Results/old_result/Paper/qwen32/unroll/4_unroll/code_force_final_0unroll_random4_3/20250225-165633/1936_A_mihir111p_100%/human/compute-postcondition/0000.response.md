The given code snippet is:

```python
print('?', a, b, c, d)
```

Based on the initial state provided:
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\), where \(n\) is the length of the secret permutation \(p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\).
- The function `func_1` is used to make a query by providing these four indices and receiving the comparison result between \((p_a | p_b)\) and \((p_c | p_d)\).

The `print` statement will output the character `'?'` followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The exact numerical values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not provided, but we know they are within the range from 0 to \(n-1\).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)**
