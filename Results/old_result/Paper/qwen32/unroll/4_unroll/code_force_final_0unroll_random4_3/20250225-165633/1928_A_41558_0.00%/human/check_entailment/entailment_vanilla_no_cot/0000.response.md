Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The key points are:
1. The original rectangle can be cut parallel to one of its sides.
2. The two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
3. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.

The program's logic seems to be based on the following observations:
1. If both dimensions of the rectangle are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`), it is impossible to form a new rectangle because the cuts will result in rectangles with odd dimensions that cannot be rearranged into a different rectangle.
2. If one dimension is exactly twice the other (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`), it is also impossible to form a new rectangle because the only way to cut the rectangle would result in two rectangles that can only form the same rectangle when rearranged.
3. Otherwise, it is possible to form a new rectangle.

However, there is a flaw in the logic:
- The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is not sufficient. It should check if one dimension is an integer multiple of the other, not just exactly twice. For example, a rectangle of size `6 x 3` can be cut into `3 x 3` and `3 x 3`, which can then be rearranged to form a `6 x 3` rectangle, which is the same as the original. Thus, this condition should be more general.

The correct condition should be:
- If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to form a new rectangle.
- If one dimension is not an integer multiple of the other, it is possible to form a new rectangle.

Here is the corrected logic:
- If `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`, print 'NO'.
- Otherwise, if `a % b != 0 and b % a != 0`, print 'YES'.
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
