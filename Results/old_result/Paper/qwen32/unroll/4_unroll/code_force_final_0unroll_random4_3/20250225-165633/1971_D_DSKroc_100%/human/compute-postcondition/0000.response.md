The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means the value of `t` is updated based on the user input. The precondition specifies that `t` is initially an integer within the range 1 to 500. After the execution of the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided by the user, which is also within the range 1 to 500. The string `s` and its properties remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500, and `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 to 500.**
