Given the initial state, let's analyze the variables and the print statement:

- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, but their specific values are not provided.
- `ans` is a set of values generated by loop operations.
- If `0` is in `ans`, `ans` now includes `n` and excludes `0`.
- `r` and `c` are the values from the last iteration of the loop.

The `print(*ans)` statement will print all the elements in the set `ans`, separated by spaces.

Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` are not provided, we can only describe the final state of `ans` based on the given conditions.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State of `ans`**: We don't know the initial elements in `ans`, but we know that it is a set.
2. **Condition**: If `0` is in `ans`, it will be removed and `n` will be added.
3. **Final State of `ans`**: After the loop operations and the condition is applied, `ans` will contain some elements, possibly including `n` if `0` was originally in the set.

### Output Description:
The output will be the elements of the set `ans` after the loop operations and the condition is applied. Since the exact elements of `ans` are not known, we can describe the output in terms of the final state of `ans`.

Output: **the elements of the set `ans` after the loop operations and the condition (if 0 was in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added)**
