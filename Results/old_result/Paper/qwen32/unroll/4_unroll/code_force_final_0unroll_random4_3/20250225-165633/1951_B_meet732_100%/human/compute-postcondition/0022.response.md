Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing up to 2 indices of cows with ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is the count of such cows (0, 1, or 2). `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1. Therefore, the length of `ind` is either 2 or 0. Additionally, the first element of `ind` is not 0, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.**
