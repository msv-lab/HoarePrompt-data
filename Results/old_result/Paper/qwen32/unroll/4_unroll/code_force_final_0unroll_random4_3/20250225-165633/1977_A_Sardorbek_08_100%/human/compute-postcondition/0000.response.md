The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `n` and `m` between 1 and 100. The value of `a` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is newly assigned by the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer.**
