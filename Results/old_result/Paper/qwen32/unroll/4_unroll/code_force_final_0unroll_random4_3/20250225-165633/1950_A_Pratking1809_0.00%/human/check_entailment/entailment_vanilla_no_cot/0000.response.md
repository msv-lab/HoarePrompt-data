Correctness: **False**

The given program incorrectly handles the "NONE" case. Specifically, the `else` statement is not correctly aligned with the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK". The `else` statement will be executed if the second condition (`a < b > c`) is not met, which includes cases where the digits form a "STAIR" or neither a "STAIR" nor a "PEAK". To fix this, you should use `elif` for the "PEAK" condition to ensure that "NONE" is only printed when neither "STAIR" nor "PEAK" conditions are met. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This change ensures that "NONE" is only printed when the digits do not form either a "STAIR" or a "PEAK".
