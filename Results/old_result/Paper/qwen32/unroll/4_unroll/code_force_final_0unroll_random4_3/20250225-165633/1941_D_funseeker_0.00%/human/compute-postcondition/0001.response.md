The given code snippet only modifies the variable `ans` by reassigning it to a set containing the value of `x`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change for `ans` while keeping the other variables as they were initially described.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are reassigned to the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.**
