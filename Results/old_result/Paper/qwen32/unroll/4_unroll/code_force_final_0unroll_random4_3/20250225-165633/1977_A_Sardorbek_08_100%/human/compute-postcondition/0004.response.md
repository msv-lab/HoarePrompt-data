Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then prints 'YES' if `n` is equal to `m`, 'NO' if `n` is less than `m`, 'Yes' if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise.**
