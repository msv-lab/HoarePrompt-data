The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the `elements` list and assigns it to the variable `s2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is a list containing one element, which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. `s` is the sum of the integers in `elements`. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**
