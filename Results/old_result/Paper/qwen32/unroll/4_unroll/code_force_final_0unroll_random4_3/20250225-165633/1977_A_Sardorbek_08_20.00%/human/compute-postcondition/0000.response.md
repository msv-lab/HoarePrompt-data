Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the integer input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
