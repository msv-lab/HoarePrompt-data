The provided code snippet defines a new lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. This new definition of `R` overwrites the previous lambda function `R` which was used to read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each split string to an integer, and return a list of these integers.

Therefore, the lambda function `I` remains unchanged, and the new lambda function `R` is now defined to read and return a single integer from the input.

Output State: **The lambda function `I` is defined to read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each split string to an integer, and return a list of these integers. The lambda function `R` is defined to read a line of input, convert it to an integer, and return this integer.**
