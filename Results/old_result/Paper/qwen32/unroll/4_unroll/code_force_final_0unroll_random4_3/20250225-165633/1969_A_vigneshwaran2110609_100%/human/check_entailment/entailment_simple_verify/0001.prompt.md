You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):

        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True

                break

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains the number of friends, `n`.
     - The second line contains `n` integers, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n`, where `p_i` is the best friend of the `i-th` friend.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

3. **Logic:**
   - A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.
   - To minimize the number of invitations, the goal is to find the smallest subset of friends such that at least 2 of them will attend the party.

### Program Analysis:
Here's the provided code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends, `x`, and the list of best friends, `l`.

2. **Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the list of best friends.
   - It checks if there is any pair `(i, p_i)` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. This condition checks if `i` is the best friend of `p_i` and vice versa (i.e., they form a mutual best friendship).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because only 2 invitations are needed (one for each in the pair).
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program assumes that if there is a mutual best friendship, only 2 invitations are needed. This is correct.
- However, the program incorrectly assumes that if there is no mutual best friendship, the answer is always `3`. This is not necessarily true. There could be cases where 2 invitations are still sufficient to bring at least 2 friends to the party, but they are not part of a mutual best friendship.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not cover all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where 2 invitations are sufficient but do not involve a mutual best friendship.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all scenarios correctly and may output incorrect results for certain test cases.
