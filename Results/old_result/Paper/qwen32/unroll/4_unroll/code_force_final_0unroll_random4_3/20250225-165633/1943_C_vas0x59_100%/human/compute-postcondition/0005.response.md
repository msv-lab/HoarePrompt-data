To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1` does. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only infer that `a` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value or state of `a`. However, we can state that `a` will be whatever `func_1(d)` returns.

The initial state mentions that `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the outer list. This state remains unchanged. Similarly, `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices, and this state also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the outer list; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
