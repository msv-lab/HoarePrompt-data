You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The strings a and b consist only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is the first input binary string, `b` is the second input binary string, `k` is the count of matched characters in `a` that appear in `b` in the correct order, `j` is the position in `b` where the search stopped.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: - The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is the count of matched characters in `a` that appear in `b` in the correct order.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `k`.
    #
    #Output:
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
