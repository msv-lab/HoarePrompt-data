You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` modifies the input array `arr` and `cliquess` by setting specific segments of `arr` to a sequence of increasing and decreasing values based on the `left` and `right` indices, and assigns the `clique` value to the corresponding segment in `cliquess`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function is designed to handle each test case.
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays: `arr` for the values assigned to vertices and `cliquess` for the clique assignments.
   - It then iterates through each clique and calls `make_array` to populate the arrays.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - This function is supposed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for a specific range of vertices.
   - It calculates `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` to distribute values in a way that respects the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - It assigns values to `arr` and clique numbers to `cliquess`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are used in `make_array` but are defined in `func_1`. In Python, this would cause an `UnboundLocalError` because `make_array` does not recognize `arr` and `cliquess` as global variables.
   - To fix this, `arr` and `cliquess` should either be passed as parameters to `make_array` or declared as global variables.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**:
   - The logic for assigning values in `make_array` seems to be intended to distribute the values in a way that respects the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`, but it is not clear whether this distribution guarantees the minimum number of cliques.
   - The distribution strategy should ensure that all pairs within a clique satisfy the condition and that the number of cliques is minimized.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when `k` is very small or very large.
   - It is important to ensure that the program works correctly for all valid inputs within the given constraints.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, particularly the use of global variables and the lack of clarity in the distribution strategy, the provided program is not guaranteed to be correct for all test cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
