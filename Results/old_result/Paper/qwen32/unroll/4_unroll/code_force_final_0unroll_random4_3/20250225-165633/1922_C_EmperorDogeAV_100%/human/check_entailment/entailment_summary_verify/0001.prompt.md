You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = input().split()
    for i in range(n):
        cities[i] = int(cities[i])
    forward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    cities.reverse()
    backward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    pref_sum_f = [0]
    pref_sum_b = [0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        pref_sum_f.append(pref_sum_f[i] + forward_cities[i])
        pref_sum_b.append(pref_sum_b[i] + backward_cities[i])
    pref_sum_b.reverse()
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(a), int(b))
        if a < b:
            print(pref_sum_f[b - 1] - pref_sum_f[a - 1])
        else:
            print(pref_sum_b[b - 1] - pref_sum_b[a - 1])

def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `cities` representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order and an integer `n` which is the number of test cases. It calculates, for each city (except the last one), whether the next city is closer or the previous city is closer, and returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` elements. Each element in `prog_cities` is either `1` if the next city is closer or the distance to the previous city if the previous city is closer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city. However, it incorrectly calculates the closest city and the cost to travel to it.
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly determine the closest city and assigns costs incorrectly. For example, in the example provided, it should assign a cost of 1 when traveling to the closest city, but it assigns the actual distance instead.

2. **Incorrect Indexing and Calculation of Prefix Sums**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) based on the incorrect costs calculated by `func_1`.
   - The prefix sums are used to determine the minimum cost to travel between cities, but since the costs are incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the input correctly but does not handle the closest city logic properly, leading to incorrect cost calculations.
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to travel to the closest city for a minimal cost, which is a key part of the problem.

Here is an example of how the program fails:

**Example Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce the expected output because it incorrectly calculates the costs to travel between cities and does not handle the closest city logic correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
