Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Problems**:
   - The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Problems**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It then iterates through each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
     - If a difficulty level `i` is not present in the `Counter` object `hmp` (meaning it doesn't appear in the string `s`), it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level.
     - If a difficulty level `i` is present but the count is less than `m`, it adds `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to account for the shortfall.
   
4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold `m` rounds.

5. **Edge Cases Considered**:
   - The program handles cases where no problems of a certain difficulty level are present in the bank by adding `m` for each missing difficulty level.
   - It also handles cases where the number of problems of a certain difficulty level is less than `m` by adding the difference to `ans`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
