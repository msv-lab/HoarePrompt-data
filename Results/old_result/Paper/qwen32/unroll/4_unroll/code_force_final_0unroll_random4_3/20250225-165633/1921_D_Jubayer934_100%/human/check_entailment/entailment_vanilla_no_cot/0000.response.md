Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum total difference \( D \) that can be obtained. Here are some issues with the logic:

1. **Sorting and Selection**: The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order and the array `b` in descending order. However, it only selects the first `n` elements from `b` in descending order. This might not be optimal for maximizing the difference.

2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach to decide whether to take elements from the start or the end of the sorted `b` array. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum difference because it only considers a limited number of combinations.

3. **Logic for Choosing Elements**: The logic for choosing elements from `b` is flawed. The program breaks out of the loop after finding the first element where the difference with the end of `b` is larger, but it does not consider all possible combinations to maximize the difference.

To correctly solve the problem, a more optimal approach would be to always pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa, ensuring that the differences are maximized. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Pair smallest of a with largest of b and vice versa
        max_diff = 0
        i, j = 0, m - 1
        while i < n:
            max_diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[j]), abs(a[i] - b[i]))
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        
        print(max_diff)

# Example usage
func()
```

This approach ensures that for each element in `a`, we consider the maximum possible difference by pairing it with the largest and smallest available elements in `b`.
