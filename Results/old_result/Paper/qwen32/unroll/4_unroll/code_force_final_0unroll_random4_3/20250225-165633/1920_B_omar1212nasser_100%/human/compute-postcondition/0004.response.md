The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `removals`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `removals`. If `removals` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). The initial state of `i` does not need to be adjusted because `i` is initialized in the loop header.

To ensure that the loop executes, `removals` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is 1 as per the loop header, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element, which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of the integers in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`**
