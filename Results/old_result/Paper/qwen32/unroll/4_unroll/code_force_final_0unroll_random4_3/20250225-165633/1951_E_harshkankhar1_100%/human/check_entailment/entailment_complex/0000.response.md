### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine if a given string can be partitioned into substrings, where each substring is not a palindrome. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness against the problem statement:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing the string with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles each test case. It reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome by calling `func_1(s)`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by `1` (indicating one partition), and the string `s` itself.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it then searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character (`s[0]`). This index is stored in `x`.
     - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it means the string consists of only one character repeated, and thus it cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings. It prints "NO".
     - If a different character is found, it checks if the substring starting from this character to the end (`s[x + 1:]`) is not a palindrome. If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2` (indicating two partitions), and the two substrings: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of the string). If `x` is either of these, it prints "NO" because no valid partition can be made.
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `sinktheyacht`
  - Since `sinktheyacht` is not a palindrome, the function prints "YES", `1`, and `sinktheyacht`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `lllllllll`
  - The string is a palindrome, and there are no differing characters. Thus, it prints "NO".

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `uwuowouwu`
  - The string is a palindrome, but there are differing characters. The function finds the first differing character at index `1` (`w` vs `u`). It checks the substring `s[2:]` (`uowouwu`), which is not a palindrome. Thus, it prints "YES", `2`, and the substrings `uw` and `uowouwu`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given problem by checking the conditions specified and providing the appropriate output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
