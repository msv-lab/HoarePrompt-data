You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the array a contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is a space-separated string of integers from the array `a`, sorted in ascending order. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` and `ar` are not retained after each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The task is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The current implementation sorts the array and prints it, but it does not compute the beauty of the rearranged array.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 1 3
```
The program will output: `1 2 3`, which is the sorted array, but it should output the maximum beauty, which is `2` (as explained in the problem statement).

The correct approach would be to sort the array and then compute the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the array and calculates the beauty as required by the problem statement.
