Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The current implementation sorts the array and prints it, but it does not compute the beauty of the rearranged array.

The annotated code confirms that the program sorts the array and prints it as a space-separated string, but it does not calculate the beauty as required. The beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which the current implementation does not do.

The corrected version of the program, as suggested in the original assessment, sorts the array and then computes the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This corrected version would provide the correct output for the given problem.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

Final: **False**
