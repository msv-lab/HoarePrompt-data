### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem of maximizing the sum of the matrix within the constraints.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to fill an \( n \times n \) matrix with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \) using Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix.
- The maximum possible sum is achieved when each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix.
- The sum of numbers from 1 to \( n \) is \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\).
- Therefore, the maximum sum for the matrix is \(\frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2}\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the integer \( n \).
   - Prints the maximum sum as \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\) and the number of operations as \(2n\).
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
     - Performs a Type 1 operation to fill row \( i \) with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1]\).
     - Performs a Type 2 operation to fill column \( i \) with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1]\).

#### Verification of the Maximum Sum Formula:
The program uses the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\) for the maximum sum. Let's verify if this formula is correct:
- The correct maximum sum should be \(\frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2}\), as each number from 1 to \( n \) appears \( n \) times in the matrix.
- The formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\) does not match the expected maximum sum.

#### Verification of the Operations:
The operations performed by the program are:
- For each row \( i \), fill row \( i \) with \([n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1]\).
- For each column \( i \), fill column \( i \) with \([n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1]\).

This approach does not ensure that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix. Instead, it results in a specific pattern where the numbers are distributed in a descending order along each row and column, which does not maximize the sum.

#### Conclusion:
- The formula used for the maximum sum is incorrect.
- The operations performed do not achieve the maximum sum as described.

Given these findings, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
