### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The logic of the program is based on identifying the smallest contiguous segment of identical numbers in the array. If the smallest such segment is the entire array or if no such segment exists, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, and the program should output `-1`. Otherwise, the program should output the size of this smallest segment.

Let's break down the program step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar` itself.

2. **Finding the smallest segment of identical numbers**:
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 (to count the length of the current segment of identical numbers), `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity (to keep track of the smallest segment length found).
   - It then iterates through the array, comparing each element to the current segment's number (`num`). If the element matches `num`, it increments `same`. If it doesn't, it updates `minn` with the minimum of its current value and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` to ensure the last segment is considered.

3. **Determining the result**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity (which shouldn't happen given the problem constraints) or if `minn` equals the length of the array (indicating the array consists of a single segment of identical numbers), the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, which represents the size of the smallest segment of identical numbers.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `3\n2 2 2`
  - The array is entirely composed of the same number, so `minn` will be 3, which equals the length of the array. The program correctly outputs `-1`.
  
- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `5\n1 2 1 2 1`
  - The smallest segment of identical numbers has a length of 1 (e.g., any single `1` or `2`). The program correctly outputs `1`.
  
- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `1\n1`
  - The array is entirely composed of the same number, so `minn` will be 1, which equals the length of the array. The program correctly outputs `-1`.
  
- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `7\n3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
  - The smallest segment of identical numbers has a length of 1 (the `5`). The program correctly outputs `1`.

However, the problem statement and the example for Test Case 4 seem to suggest that the correct output should be `3` (removing the first three `3`s to leave `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful). This indicates that the current program logic is not correctly identifying the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic is flawed because it only considers the smallest segment of identical numbers, not the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to disrupt the beautiful property of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
