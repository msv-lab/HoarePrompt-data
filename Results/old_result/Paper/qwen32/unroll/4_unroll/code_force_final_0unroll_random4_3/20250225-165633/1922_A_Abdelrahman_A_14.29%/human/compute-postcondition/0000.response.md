The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c` directly in this snippet. The only change is the assignment of the input value to `tests`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `tests` is the integer input representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
