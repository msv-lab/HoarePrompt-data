### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

**Problem Recap:**
- We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- There must be exactly `n` special characters in this string.
- A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

**Key Observations:**
- If `n` is odd, there is no way to construct a string where exactly `n` characters are special because each special character must be part of a pair (one character being equal to its neighbor while different from the other neighbors). Thus, `n` must be even for a valid solution to exist.
- If `n` is even, we can construct a string using an alternating pattern of 'A' and 'B'. For example, for `n=6`, the string "AAABAACC" has exactly 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
- If `n` is odd, it correctly prints "NO" because no valid string can have an odd number of special characters.
- If `n` is even, it prints "YES" and constructs a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters with a length of `n`. This is done by appending 'A' and 'B' alternately to the `pattern` list, which is then joined into a string.

**Execution Summary:**
- The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program: it prints "NO" for odd `n` and constructs an alternating string for even `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
