Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers structured as described. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the cow you own, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. The function returns different values based on specific conditions related to the ratings and indices of the cows. The return values are determined by the following cases: 
- Case 1: If a certain condition is met, it returns `n - 1`.
- Case 2: If a different condition is met, it returns `k - 1`.
- Case 3: If the first element of `ind` (a derived list) is greater than `k` and not 0, it returns the first element of `ind` minus 1.
- Case 4: If there is a single index in `ind` that is not 0 and less than or equal to `k`, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
- Case 5: If there are at least two indices in `ind`, it returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
- Case 6: If there are at least two indices in `ind`, it returns the greater value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- Case 7: If there are at least two indices in `ind`, it returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.**
