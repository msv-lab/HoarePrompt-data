Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a potential issue with the modulo operation when calculating the new position of the ball. Specifically, when the modulo operation results in `0`, the program incorrectly converts it to `n`, which is not correct in the context of the problem. The players are numbered from `1` to `n`, so `0` should be converted to `n` only if the result of the modulo operation is `0` and the position is being calculated in a way that wraps around to the last player. However, in the current implementation, the conversion is done without checking if the result of the modulo operation is `0`.

Here's a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 1 1
1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
5
```

In this example, the ball starts with player `1` and is thrown a distance of `1` clockwise. The correct position should be player `2`, but the program incorrectly calculates it as player `5` due to the incorrect handling of the modulo operation result.

To fix this, the code should be modified to handle the modulo operation correctly:

```python
import sys

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                new_pos = (q + r) % n
                temp.add(new_pos if new_pos != 0 else n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                new_pos = (q - r) % n
                temp.add(new_pos if new_pos != 0 else n)
        ans = temp
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))

# Example usage:
# func_4()
```

With this fix, the program should correctly handle all edge cases, including when the modulo operation results in `0`.
