Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to handle the problem as described. It iterates over each test case, processes the input arrays `a` and `b`, and counts the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements from `b`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - For each test case, the program reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list `a` of `n` integers and the list `b` of `m` integers.
   - The `todo` set is initialized with the elements of `b`. This set keeps track of the elements from `b` that still need to be matched in the current subarray.
   - The `done` set is initialized as an empty set. This set keeps track of the elements from `b` that have been matched in the current subarray.
   - The `extra` set is initialized as an empty set. This set keeps track of the elements in the current subarray that are not in `b`.

2. **Initial Subarray Processing**:
   - The program processes the first subarray of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each element in this subarray, it checks if it is in `todo`. If it is, the element is moved from `todo` to `done`. If it is not, the element is added to `extra`.

3. **Counting Good Subarrays**:
   - The program initializes the `ans` counter to 1 if the initial subarray is good (i.e., if `len(done) >= k`), otherwise it initializes `ans` to 0.
   - The program then slides the window one element at a time from left to right across the array `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (from the right), it updates the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets accordingly.
   - For each element removed from the window (from the left), it updates the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets accordingly.
   - After updating the sets, it checks if the current subarray is good and increments `ans` if it is.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all subarrays for a given test case, the program prints the value of `ans`.

The logic correctly handles the sliding window approach, ensuring that the program efficiently counts the number of good subarrays without unnecessary recomputation. The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` allows for efficient membership checking and updates.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the solution appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
