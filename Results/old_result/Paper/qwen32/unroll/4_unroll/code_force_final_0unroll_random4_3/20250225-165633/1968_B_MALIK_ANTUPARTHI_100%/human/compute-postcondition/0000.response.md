Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is an integer (previously a binary string of length n), and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `a` has been reassigned to an integer value from the input, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
