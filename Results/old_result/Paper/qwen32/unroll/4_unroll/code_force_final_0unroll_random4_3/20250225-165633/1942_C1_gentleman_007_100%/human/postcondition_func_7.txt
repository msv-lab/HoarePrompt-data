The function takes a 2D list `l` of integers and returns a 2D list `p` of integers with dimensions `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, where each element `p[i][j]` represents the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner (0,0) to (i-1,j-1) in `l`. The first row and the first column of `p` are initialized to `0`.
