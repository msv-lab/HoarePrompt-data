The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum length of consecutive segments in the list `a` where all elements in a segment are the same. If no such segment exists or the entire list is a single segment, it prints `-1`.
