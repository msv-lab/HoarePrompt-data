Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, and `costs` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. The variable `h` is newly introduced and is assigned the value 0.
