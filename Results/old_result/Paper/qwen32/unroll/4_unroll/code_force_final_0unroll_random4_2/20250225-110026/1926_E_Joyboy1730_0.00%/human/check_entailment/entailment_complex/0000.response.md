Reasoning:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Initialization of `L`:** The list `L` is initialized as an empty list and is never populated. This means the `for a in L:` loop will never execute, and no output will be produced.

2. **Calculation of `m`:** The variable `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the number of odd numbers up to `n`. However, this value is not used to populate `L` or contribute to the logic of determining the `k`-th card.

3. **Logic for determining the `k`-th card:** The code attempts to determine the `k`-th card using a loop over `L`, but since `L` is empty, this logic is never reached. The intention seems to be to iterate over multiples of odd numbers and determine the position of `k` within these multiples, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

4. **Output:** The code is supposed to print the `k`-th card for each test case, but due to the issues mentioned above, no output is generated.

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to:

- Calculate the number of odd numbers up to `n`.
- Determine the `k`-th card by iterating through multiples of odd numbers until `k` is found within the range of a particular multiple.

Given the current state of the code, it is incorrect as it does not produce any output and does not follow the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
