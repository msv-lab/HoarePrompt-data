Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Shape Detection**:
   - The program only counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in the list `k`.
   - It then checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal, and if so, it prints the list `k`. This logic does not correctly identify the shape of the figure based on the given problem description.

2. **Output Mismatch**:
   - The program is supposed to output either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the shape of the '1's in the grid.
   - Instead, it prints the list `k` if the first two counts are equal, which is not the expected output.

3. **Missing Shape Detection Logic**:
   - The program does not implement any logic to check for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square.
   - It does not check for the conditions that the number of '1's in each row should be `2*i - 1` for a triangle or `k` for a square, where `i` is the row index and `k` is the side length of the square.

4. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     3
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     - The program should output "SQUARE" because the '1's form a 2x2 square.
     - However, the program will output `[2, 2]` because it only checks if the first two counts are equal and prints the counts.

5. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle or a square positioned in different parts of the grid.

Given these issues, the program is clearly incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
