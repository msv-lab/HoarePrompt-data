The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Specifically, the loop will execute `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` is the only thing that needs to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
