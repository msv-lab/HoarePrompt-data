Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Alice's Move**: Alice can remove up to `k` elements from the array to maximize the sum.
2. **Bob's Move**: Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
3. **Objective**: Find the final sum after both play optimally.

### Optimal Strategy:
- Alice should remove the `k` smallest elements to maximize the remaining sum.
- Bob should then flip the `x` smallest elements (after Alice's removal) to minimize the sum.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code follows a similar logic but has some issues:
1. **Alice's Move**: The code sorts the array and calculates the possible sums after removing up to `k` elements.
2. **Bob's Move**: The code attempts to calculate the effect of flipping the `x` smallest elements after each removal by Alice.

However, there are some flaws in the implementation:
1. **Hardcoded Case**: The function `func_2` has a hardcoded case for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which is incorrect and does not generalize to all cases.
2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The code incorrectly calculates the sum after flipping elements. It subtracts twice the sum of the `x` largest elements, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Approach:
- **Alice's Move**: Sort the array and remove the `k` smallest elements.
- **Bob's Move**: After Alice's removal, sort the remaining array and flip the `x` smallest elements.

### Correct Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        remaining = a[k:]
        # Bob flips the x smallest elements
        remaining[:x] = [-elem for elem in remaining[:x]]
        print(sum(remaining))

# Call the function to execute the solution
func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob's moves. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
