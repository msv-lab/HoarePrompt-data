The initial state describes that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`, which is independent of the values of `n` and `k`.

The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
