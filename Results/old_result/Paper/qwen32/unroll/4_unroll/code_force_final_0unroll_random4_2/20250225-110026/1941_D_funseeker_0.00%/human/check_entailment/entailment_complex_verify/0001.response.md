### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the provided annotations and the problem description to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) using `func_2()`, which correctly reads an integer from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which correctly reads three integers from standard input.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads `r` and `c` using `func_1().split()`, which correctly reads a line and splits it into two parts.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct as it starts tracking the possible positions of the ball from the initial player.
   - For each throw, it reads `r` and `c` and processes the possible new positions:
     - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new position by adding `r` to the current position and taking modulo `n`. This is correct for clockwise movement.
     - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new position by subtracting `r` from the current position and taking modulo `n`. This is correct for counterclockwise movement.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw, which correctly accumulates all possible positions.

3. **Handling Modulo Operation:**
   - The program uses the modulo operation to wrap around the circle. This is correct as it ensures that the positions are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - The check `if 0 in ans` and the subsequent replacement of `0` with `n` is correct because in a circle, position `0` is equivalent to position `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all throws, the program prints the number of possible positions in `ans` using `print(len(ans))`.
   - It then prints the sorted list of possible positions using `print(*ans)`. This ensures that the output is in increasing order, as required.

### Evaluation

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for calculating the new positions based on the direction is correct.
  - The use of a set to track possible positions is appropriate because it handles duplicates naturally.
  - The handling of the modulo operation and the conversion from `0` to `n` is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where the direction is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities.
  - It correctly processes the input for multiple test cases.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The output format matches the problem description, with the number of possible positions followed by the sorted list of positions.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after the throws, considering the given constraints and requirements.

**Final: **True**
