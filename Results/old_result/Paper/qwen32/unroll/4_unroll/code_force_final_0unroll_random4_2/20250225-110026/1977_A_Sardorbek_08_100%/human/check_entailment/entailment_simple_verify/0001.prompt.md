You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), where n is the number of moves Nikita can make and m is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective:** Determine if after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
- **Operations Allowed:** 
  - Add exactly 1 cube.
  - Remove exactly 1 cube.
- **Initial State:** The tower starts with 0 cubes.
- **Constraints:** `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.

### Key Observations:
- **Parity Consideration:** Since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes will change with each move.
  - If you start with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, you will still have an even number of cubes.
  - After an odd number of moves, you will have an odd number of cubes.
- **Sufficient Condition:** 
  - If `n` (number of moves) and `m` (number of cubes desired) have the same parity (both odd or both even), it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
  - If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided code to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line is unnecessary and does nothing.
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **First Condition (`b == c`):**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` (b) is equal to `m` (c), it is always possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding a cube `m` times. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'YES' (case insensitive).

2. **Second Condition (`b < c`):**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` (b) is less than `m` (c), it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes since you can only add or remove one cube at a time, and you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'NO' (case insensitive).

3. **Third Condition (`b % 2 == c % 2`):**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both odd or both even), it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'Yes' (case insensitive).

4. **Else Condition:**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'No' (case insensitive).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity of `n` and `m`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
