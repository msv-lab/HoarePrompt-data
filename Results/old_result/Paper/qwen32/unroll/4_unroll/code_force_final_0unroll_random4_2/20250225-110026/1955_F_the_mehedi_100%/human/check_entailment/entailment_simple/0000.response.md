### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function `func()` correctly computes the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

The winning condition for Bob is that the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero. The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.

The numbers in the sequence can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, which correspond to binary representations:
- 1: 001
- 2: 010
- 3: 011
- 4: 100

The key observation is that:
- The XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
- The XOR of three identical numbers is the number itself.
- The XOR of four identical numbers is 0.

Thus, the strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins is to ensure that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as many times as possible.

The given program seems to follow this logic:
1. It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, Bob can win once initially because XOR of three odd counts will be non-zero, and removing one of each will make all counts even, leading to a zero XOR.
2. It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to the count of Bob's wins. This is because pairs of identical numbers can be removed, and Bob can win for each pair removed.

Let's verify this with the example inputs:

1. **Input:** `1 1 1 0`
   - Counts: 1 (odd), 1 (odd), 1 (odd), 0 (even)
   - Initial check: `cnt += 1` because all three counts are odd.
   - Further pairs: `cnt += floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) = 0`
   - Total: `cnt = 1`

2. **Input:** `1 0 1 2`
   - Counts: 1 (odd), 0 (even), 1 (odd), 2 (even)
   - Initial check: `cnt += 0` because not all three counts are odd.
   - Further pairs: `cnt += floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) = 1`
   - Total: `cnt = 1`

3. **Input:** `2 2 2 0`
   - Counts: 2 (even), 2 (even), 2 (even), 0 (even)
   - Initial check: `cnt += 0` because not all three counts are odd.
   - Further pairs: `cnt += floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 3`
   - Total: `cnt = 3`

4. **Input:** `3 3 2 0`
   - Counts: 3 (odd), 3 (odd), 2 (even), 0 (even)
   - Initial check: `cnt += 0` because not all three counts are odd.
   - Further pairs: `cnt += floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 3`
   - Total: `cnt = 3`

5. **Input:** `0 9 9 9`
   - Counts: 0 (even), 9 (odd), 9 (odd), 9 (odd)
   - Initial check: `cnt += 0` because not all three counts are odd.
   - Further pairs: `cnt += floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) = 12`
   - Total: `cnt = 12`

All the test cases match the expected output, indicating that the logic in the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
