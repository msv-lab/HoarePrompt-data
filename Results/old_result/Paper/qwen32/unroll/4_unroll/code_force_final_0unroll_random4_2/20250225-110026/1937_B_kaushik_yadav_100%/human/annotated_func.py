#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), representing the length of the grid. The next two lines each contain a binary string of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()

        work = True
        
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        counter = 1
        
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, and `counter` will have their final values as determined by the last test case processed. The variable `t` will be 0 (since the loop has finished all iterations), and the other variables will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The state of `t` is the only one that can be definitively stated to be 0, while the others depend on the specific inputs of the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a length `n` and two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of a grid. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by alternating characters from the top and bottom strings based on specific conditions and prints this string. It also calculates and prints a counter that represents the length of the longest prefix of the top string that matches the bottom string, with the additional condition that '0' in the top string can match '1' in the bottom string.
