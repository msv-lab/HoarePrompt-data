Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `times` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `check` is 2147483647.** 

The loop modifies `n`, `data`, `dic`, `ans`, and `check` during each iteration. After the loop completes, `n`, `data`, `dic`, and `ans` will reflect the state of the last iteration, and `check` will be reset to 2147483647. However, since the problem asks for the state of variables not affected by the loop, the output state for those variables remains the same as the initial state.
