Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a grid. It then accepts `n` lines of `m` characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given grid configuration.**
