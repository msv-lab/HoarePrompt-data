In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4` are defined inside the loop body, and are not part of the loop head. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust for the loop to execute is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4` are not relevant for determining whether the loop can execute, as they are initialized within the loop body for each iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
