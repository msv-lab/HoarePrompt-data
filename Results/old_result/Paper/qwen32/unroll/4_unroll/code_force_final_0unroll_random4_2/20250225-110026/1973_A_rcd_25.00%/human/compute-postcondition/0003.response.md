Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns the result for each test case based on the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`.**
