Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, including the annotations and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis
Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts. The store offers two pricing options:
1. One yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.

### Code Analysis
The provided code processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints the minimum cost as follows:
- `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
- `ans2` is the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs and possibly one additional yogurt individually: `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

### Annotations
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. The computation of `ans1` and `ans2` is also correctly described.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because the calculation of `ans2` is flawed. Specifically, it states that `ans2` does not correctly account for the number of pairs and the potential single yogurt.

### Detailed Reasoning
Let's re-examine the calculation of `ans2`:
- `b * n // 2` computes the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts.
- `a * n % 2` computes the cost of the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.

This calculation is actually correct. Here's why:
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `ans2` is simply `b * n // 2`, which is the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a`, which is the cost of buying `(n - 1) / 2` pairs and one additional yogurt individually.

### Verification with Example
Let's verify with the provided example:
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 11 + 5 = 16`
  - The correct minimum cost is indeed `15`, which is `ans1`, not `ans2`.

However, the original assessment is incorrect in stating that `ans2` is always wrong. The calculation is correct for the general case. The issue in the example is that `ans1` is actually the minimum cost, not `ans2`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is incorrect. The program correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering both the individual and pair pricing options.

**Final: True**
