To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the given code and understand what it does for each test case.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the size of an `n x n` matrix. It then calculates a sum using the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
   \]
   Simplifying the term inside the summation:
   \[
   i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
   \]
   Therefore, the formula becomes:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
   \]
   This sum can be computed iteratively.
3. **Printing**: After calculating the sum, it prints:
   - The calculated sum and `n + n` (which is `2n`).
   - For each row `j` from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines:
     - The first line starts with `1`, followed by `n - j + 1`, and then the numbers from `1` to `n`.
     - The second line starts with `2`, followed by `n - j + 1`, and then the numbers from `1` to `n`.

The output state after all the iterations will be the complete output printed for each test case. Since the output is printed directly and not stored in variables, the state of the variables at the end of the loop will be the same as at the start of the loop, except for the printed output.

Given the nature of the problem, the output state will be the printed results of all test cases.

Output State: **The printed results for each test case, which include the calculated sum and `2n`, followed by the specified matrix patterns for each row from 1 to `n`.**
