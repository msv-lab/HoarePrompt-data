Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game played on a tree with exactly two leaves. It accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (the starting node where a stone is placed). The function calculates the distances from the starting node to each of the two leaves and returns 'Ron' if at least one of these distances is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.**
