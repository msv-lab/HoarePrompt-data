### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Requirements:
The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences of `s`. The string `s` should be of the smallest possible length.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs a string by taking the first `k` letters of the alphabet and repeating this substring `n` times.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1()` reads `n` and `k`, constructs a string using the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times, and returns this string.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
Let's analyze the correctness of the program using the given examples:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `k = 2`
  - Expected Output: `ab` (or any permutation of `a` and `b`).
  - Program Output: `ab` (correct).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 1`
  - Expected Output: `aa`.
  - Program Output: `aa` (correct).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - Expected Output: A string that contains all subsequences of length 2 using `a` and `b` (e.g., `baab`).
  - Program Output: `aabb` (incorrect, as it does not contain subsequences like `ba`).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - Expected Output: A string that contains all subsequences of length 2 using `a`, `b`, and `c` (e.g., `abcbac`).
  - Program Output: `aaabbb` (incorrect, as it does not contain subsequences like `ba`, `bc`, `cb`, etc.).

#### Conclusion:
The program fails to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are present in the generated string for `n > 1` and `k > 1`. The approach of simply repeating the first `k` letters `n` times does not guarantee the presence of all required subsequences.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

**Final: False**
