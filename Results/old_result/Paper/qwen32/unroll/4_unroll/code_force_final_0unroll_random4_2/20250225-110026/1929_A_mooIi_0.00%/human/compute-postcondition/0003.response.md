Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers in ascending order and prints the sorted list with elements separated by spaces. The function does not modify the input values or maintain any state between test cases.**
