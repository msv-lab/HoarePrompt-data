You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers representing a visited state (0 or 1) for each node, da is an integer representing the current node being processed, and rank is a list of integers representing the rank of each node.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers representing a visited state (0 or 1) for each node, `da` is an integer representing the current node being processed, `rank` is a list of integers representing the rank of each node, `tmp` is 10, and the length of the list `d[da]` is not equal to 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers representing a visited state (0 or 1) for each node, `da` is an integer representing the current node being processed, `rank` is a list of integers representing the rank of each node, `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all unprocessed nodes in `d[da]`.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all unprocessed nodes in `d[da]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing` representing the visited state (0 or 1) for each node, an integer `da` representing the current node being processed, and a list `rank` representing the rank of each node. If the function reaches a certain condition, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all unprocessed nodes in `d[da]`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all unprocessed nodes in `d[da]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
