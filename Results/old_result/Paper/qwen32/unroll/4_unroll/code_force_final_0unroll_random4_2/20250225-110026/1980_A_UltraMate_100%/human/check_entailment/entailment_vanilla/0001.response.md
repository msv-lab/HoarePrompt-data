Let's break down the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of problems in the bank) and `m` (the number of upcoming rounds).
   - It then reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of New Problems:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will hold the total number of new problems needed.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
     - If a difficulty level is not present in the bank (i.e., not in `hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds require a problem of that difficulty level.
     - If a difficulty level is present but not enough (i.e., `hmp[i] < m`), it adds the difference `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans` to ensure there are enough problems for all `m` rounds.
   - This approach correctly calculates the minimum number of new problems needed by ensuring that each difficulty level 'A' to 'G' is available in at least `m` copies.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the calculated `ans`, which is the minimum number of new problems required.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases, such as when a difficulty level is completely missing or when there are not enough problems of a certain level.

**Correctness: True**
