The code snippet `ans = [0] * n` initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all of which are `0`. This operation does not affect the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, or `suffZero`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s1`, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, with `preOne[0]` being 0, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
