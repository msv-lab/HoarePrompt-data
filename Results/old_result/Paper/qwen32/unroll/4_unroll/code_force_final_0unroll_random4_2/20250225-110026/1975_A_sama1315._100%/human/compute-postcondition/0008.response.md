Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- **`idx`**: This variable is incremented by `1 + n1 + 1 + n2 + 1 + ... + nk + 1` throughout the loop, where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` in each iteration. However, the exact value of `idx` is not needed for the print statement.
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`a`**: This variable holds the last list of integers processed in the loop.
- **`data`**: This variable remains unchanged and is only read from.
- **`results`**: This list contains the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement joins all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). The `results` list contains the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.

Since the exact contents of `results` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the `results` list.

### Final Output:
Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultk (where result1, result2, ..., resultk are the results of func_1(a) for each iteration of the loop)**
