The variable `check` is assigned the value `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is a specific constant value. The values of `t`, `times`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `times` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `check` is 2147483647.**
