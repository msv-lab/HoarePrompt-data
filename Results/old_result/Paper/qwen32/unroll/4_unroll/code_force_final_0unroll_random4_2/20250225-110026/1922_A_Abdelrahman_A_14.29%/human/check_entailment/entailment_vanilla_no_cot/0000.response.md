Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

For each character position `i`:
- If `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to `t[i]`, and `c[i]` must not be equal to `t[i]`.
- If `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`, and `c[i]` must be equal to the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains logical flaws.

1. **Initial Check for `c == a` or `c == b`**:
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` and immediately prints "NO" if true. This is incorrect because the template can still be constructed such that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not, even if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`.

2. **Checking Characters in `c`**:
   - The program checks if any character in `c` is not present in `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints "YES". This is also incorrect because the template can be constructed by using uppercase letters in the template to differentiate `c` from `a` and `b`.

3. **Template Construction**:
   - The program does not attempt to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`. It only checks for specific conditions that do not necessarily guarantee the existence of such a template.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- For each character position `i`, construct the template character `t[i]` based on the characters in `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]`.
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` should be the lowercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` should be different.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` should be the uppercase version of a character that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `c[i]` should be equal to one of `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
