The code snippet provided reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input. These integers represent the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The initial state does not specify the values of `n` and `m`, only that they are integers within the range 1 to 200,000.

After executing the code snippet, the variables `n` and `m` will be assigned the values read from the input. The other parts of the initial state, including the binary strings `a` and `b`, remain unchanged as they are not referenced or modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.**
