The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'YES' if the conditions `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` and `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` are not met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints output based on the input conditions.
