Reasoning:

The given program is trying to solve the problem by calculating the frequency of each card number and then applying the operation rules to determine the minimum number of cards left. However, there are several issues with the provided program that make it incorrect for the given problem.

1. **Logic Flaws in the `func_1` Function**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to help in determining how many cards can be reduced, but the current logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It simply caps the frequency of each card to `k`, which does not help in calculating the correct number of cards left after performing the operations.
   - The function does not actually calculate the number of operations that can be performed or how many cards will be left after those operations.

2. **Incorrect Use of Frequency Table**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency table's values, which does not correspond to the correct logic for determining the minimum number of cards left.
   - The program does not correctly simulate the process of exchanging cards based on the given rules.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when `k > n` or `k == n`, although these are partially addressed with simple print statements.

4. **Lack of Proper Simulation**:
   - The program does not simulate the process of exchanging cards and reducing the count of cards based on the given rules.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
