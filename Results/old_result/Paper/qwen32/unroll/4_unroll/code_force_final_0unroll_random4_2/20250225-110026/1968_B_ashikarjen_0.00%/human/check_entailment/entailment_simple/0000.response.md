### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum length of a prefix of string `a` that is a subsequence of string `b`. The provided function, `func_1`, implements this logic correctly by iterating through each character of string `a` and checking if it can be matched with characters in string `b` in order. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` and `m` are the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `a` and `b` are the binary strings provided as input.
   - `k` is initialized to 0 to count the length of the matching prefix.
   - `j` is initialized to 0 to track the current position in string `b`.

2. **Iterating through `a`:**
   - For each character in `a` (using index `i`), the function searches for this character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - A `while` loop increments `j` until the character `a[i]` is found in `b` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.

3. **Matching Characters:**
   - If `j` is still within the bounds of `b` after the `while` loop, it means `a[i]` was found in `b`. Thus, `k` is incremented by 1 to count this match, and `j` is incremented by 1 to move to the next character in `b`.
   - If `j` has reached the end of `b` and the character `a[i]` was not found, the loop breaks, indicating that no further characters in `a` can be matched as a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints `k`, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the function with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
   - The function correctly identifies that the prefix `"10"` of `a` is a subsequence of `b`, resulting in `k = 2`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `a = "100"`, `b = "110"`
   - The function correctly identifies that the prefix `"10"` of `a` is a subsequence of `b`, resulting in `k = 2`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `a = "1"`, `b = "111"`
   - The function correctly identifies that the entire `a` is a subsequence of `b`, resulting in `k = 1`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `a = "1011"`, `b = "1111"`
   - The function correctly identifies that the prefix `"101"` of `a` is a subsequence of `b`, resulting in `k = 1`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - `a = "100"`, `b = "11010"`
   - The function correctly identifies that the entire `a` is a subsequence of `b`, resulting in `k = 3`.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`
   - The function correctly identifies that no characters of `a` can be matched as a subsequence of `b`, resulting in `k = 0`.

### Conclusion:

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of a prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the function is:

**Correctness: True**
