### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The given solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To determine if the array can be rearranged into a sorted order using the described operation.
- **Implementation**: The function sorts the array and checks if any contiguous subsequence of the array concatenated with itself contains the sorted version of the array.
- **Logic**: The logic behind the function is correct. By concatenating the array with itself, any possible rotation of the array can be represented as a contiguous subsequence within this concatenated array. If the sorted version of the array can be found within this concatenated array, it means that the array can be rearranged into a sorted order using the allowed operation.
- **State**: The function returns 'Yes' if the sorted version of the array is found in any subsequence of the concatenated array, otherwise it returns 'No'.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To read multiple test cases from the standard input, process each test case using `func_1`, and print the results.
- **Implementation**: The function reads the input, processes each test case, and accumulates the results. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
- **State**: The function correctly processes each test case and accumulates the results, which are then printed in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It checks if the array can be rearranged into a sorted order using the described operation and handles multiple test cases as required.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
