Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly simulate the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. The hardcoded return value of `0` for a specific case (`removals == 6 and negatives == 3`) indicates that the function is not generalized and does not cover all scenarios.

Here is a counter-example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 2
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice can remove the two smallest elements (1 and 2), leaving the array as [3, 4].
- Bob can then flip the sign of the smaller element (3), resulting in the array [-3, 4].
- The final sum is -3 + 4 = 1.

However, the program will not produce the correct output for this case because it does not correctly simulate the removal and flipping strategies. The function `func_2` does not account for the optimal choices Alice and Bob would make in a general scenario.

To fix the program, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as:
- Sorting the array.
- Allowing Alice to remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
- Allowing Bob to flip the sign of the smallest elements to minimize the sum.
- Considering all possible combinations of removals and sign flips within the given constraints.

The current implementation is insufficient and fails to cover all potential cases, making it incorrect.
