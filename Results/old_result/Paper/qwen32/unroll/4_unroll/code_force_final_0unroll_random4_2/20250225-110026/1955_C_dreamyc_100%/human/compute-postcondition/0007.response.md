The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, the state of `n` is given as `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, which already ensures that the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes.

The other variables (`k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `s_a`, `s_b`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 0**
