To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the loop:

1. For each iteration (up to `a` times), the code reads two integers `b` and `c`, followed by two strings `d` and `e`.
2. It initializes a variable `k` to 0.
3. It then enters another loop that iterates up to `b` times.
4. Inside this loop, it checks if the character `d[j]` is in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` (`e[k:]`).
5. If `d[j]` is found, it updates `k` to the index where `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]` plus 1, plus the current `k` value. If `k` equals `c` or if `j` is the last index (`b - 1`), it sets `k` to `j + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
6. If `d[j]` is not found, it sets `k` to `j` and breaks out of the loop.
7. Finally, it prints the value of `k`.

Since the loop prints a value of `k` in each iteration and `k` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, the state of `k` after the loop ends is irrelevant because the value of `k` is not retained between iterations. The only thing that changes in each iteration is the printed value of `k`.

Given the initial state and the loop, the output state will be the same as the initial state for `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`, and `b` will be the last value read for `b` in the last iteration of the outer loop. However, since `b` is read in each iteration and does not affect the state outside the loop, we can consider it as not being retained in the output state description.

Thus, the output state in terms of the variables provided in the initial state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer equal to the input value; `b` is a binary string of length `m`.**
