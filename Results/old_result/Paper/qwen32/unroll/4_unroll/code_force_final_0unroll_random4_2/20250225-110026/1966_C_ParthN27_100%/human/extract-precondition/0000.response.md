Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where each a_i represents the number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
