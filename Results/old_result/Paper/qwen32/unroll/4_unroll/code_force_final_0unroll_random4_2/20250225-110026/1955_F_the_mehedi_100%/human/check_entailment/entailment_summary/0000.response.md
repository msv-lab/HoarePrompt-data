### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. According to the rules, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.

Let's break down the code's logic and see if it aligns with the problem's requirements:

1. **Initial XOR Check:**
   - The code checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd (`a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1`). If this condition is true, it means the XOR of the sequence with these counts would be zero when no numbers are removed (since the XOR of an odd number of ones, twos, and threes can result in zero under certain conditions). Therefore, Bob can win at the start, and `cnt` is incremented by 1.

2. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each count `x` in the list `a`, the code calculates `math.floor(x / 2)`. This represents the number of pairs of each number that can be removed. Since removing pairs of the same number does not change the XOR (XOR of a number with itself is zero), this effectively reduces the problem to a scenario where we are left with an odd number of each type of number if the initial count was odd, or no numbers if the initial count was even.

3. **Summing Up:**
   - The sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in `a` gives the maximum number of times Bob can win after pairs are removed. This is because each pair removal does not change the XOR, and thus, Bob can continue to win until no more pairs can be removed.

### Verification with Examples:

- **First Example: `1 1 1 0`**
  - Initial XOR check: `1 % 2 == 1 % 2 == 1 % 2 == 1` is true, so `cnt += 1`.
  - Pair removal: `floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.
  - Total: `1 + 0 = 1`.

- **Second Example: `1 0 1 2`**
  - Initial XOR check: `1 % 2 == 0 % 2 == 1 % 2 == 1` is false, so `cnt += 0`.
  - Pair removal: `floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.
  - Total: `0 + 1 = 1`.

- **Third Example: `2 2 2 0`**
  - Initial XOR check: `2 % 2 == 2 % 2 == 2 % 2 == 1` is false, so `cnt += 0`.
  - Pair removal: `floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`.
  - Total: `0 + 3 = 3`.

- **Fourth Example: `3 3 2 0`**
  - Initial XOR check: `3 % 2 == 3 % 2 == 2 % 2 == 1` is false, so `cnt += 0`.
  - Pair removal: `floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`.
  - Total: `0 + 3 = 3`.

- **Fifth Example: `0 9 9 9`**
  - Initial XOR check: `0 % 2 == 9 % 2 == 9 % 2 == 1` is false, so `cnt += 0`.
  - Pair removal: `floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.
  - Total: `0 + 12 = 12`.

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
