### Reasoning:
The given program aims to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and ensuring the total sum of the radii strictly decreases. The approach taken by the program involves performing a depth-first search (DFS) to identify connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and then reads the coordinates `(x_i, y_i)` and radius `r_i` for each disk.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized. `visited` keeps track of which disks have been visited during the DFS, while `coef0` and `coef1` are used to store coefficients for the system of equations representing the constraints on the radii.

3. **DFS Traversal**:
   - For each disk, if it hasn't been visited, the program initiates a DFS traversal.
   - During the DFS, it checks all other disks to see if they are tangent to the current disk (i.e., the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii).
   - If a tangent disk is found and hasn't been visited, it is marked as visited, added to the `nodes` list, and its coefficients are updated based on the current disk's coefficients.

4. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - For each connected component identified by the DFS, the program calculates the sum of coefficients `coef0` and `coef1`.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero for any connected component, it indicates that it's possible to adjust the radii in the desired manner, and the program outputs "YES".
   - If no such component is found, the program outputs "NO".

### Analysis:
- The DFS traversal correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks.
- The coefficient update logic (`coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`) is used to ensure that the sum of the radii can be adjusted while maintaining the tangency constraints.
- The condition `c1 != 0` ensures that there is a way to adjust the radii such that the total sum decreases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It uses DFS to identify connected components of tangent disks and checks if it's possible to adjust their radii while maintaining tangency and decreasing the total sum.

**Correctness: True**
