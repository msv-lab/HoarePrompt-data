The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't intend to use. In this case, the loop will execute based on the integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. The loop will run `t` times.

Given this, the state before the loop starts needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and the integer `n` are part of the input inside the loop, not the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
