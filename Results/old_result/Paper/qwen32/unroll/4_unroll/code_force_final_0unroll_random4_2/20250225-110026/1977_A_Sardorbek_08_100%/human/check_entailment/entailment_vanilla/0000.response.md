Let's analyze the program step by step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
2. **Moves**:
   - Add 1 cube.
   - Remove 1 cube.
3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= t <= 100` (number of test cases).
   - `1 <= n, m <= 100` (number of moves and desired cubes).

### Key Observations:
- **Parity**: The parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m` plays a crucial role.
  - If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes `m` must be different from the initial number of cubes (which is 0).
  - If `n` is even, the final number of cubes `m` can be the same as the initial number of cubes.
- **Exact Moves**: If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes, as each move can only add or remove one cube.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to follow these observations, but let's break it down:
- **Input Handling**: It reads `t` test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- **Logic**:
  - If `n == m`, it prints "YES". This is correct for the case where the number of moves equals the number of cubes (and `n` is even).
  - If `n < m`, it prints "NO". This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
  - If `n % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes". This is correct because if `n` and `m` have the same parity, it's possible to reach `m` cubes.
  - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness Check:
- The program handles all the key conditions:
  - `n == m` and `n` is even.
  - `n < m`.
  - Parity check (`n % 2 == m % 2`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Correctness: True**
