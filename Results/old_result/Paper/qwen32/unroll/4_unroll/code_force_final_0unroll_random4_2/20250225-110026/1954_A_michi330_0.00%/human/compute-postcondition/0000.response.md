Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case are not yet assigned as the input for those variables has not been processed.
