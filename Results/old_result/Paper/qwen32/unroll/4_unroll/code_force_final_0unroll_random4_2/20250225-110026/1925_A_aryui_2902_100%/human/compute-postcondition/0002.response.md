Output State: **The program returns a string consisting of the first k letters of the alphabet repeated n times.**

To elaborate, the program reads `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs a string `s` containing the first 26 letters of the alphabet. For each test case, it returns a substring of `s` from the start up to the `k`-th character, repeated `n` times.
