Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the integer input by the user, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the input statement.
