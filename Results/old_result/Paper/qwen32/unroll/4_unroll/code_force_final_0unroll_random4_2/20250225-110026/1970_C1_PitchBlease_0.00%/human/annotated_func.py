#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed. The tree has exactly two leaves.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node in the tree and the corresponding value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node. The `n`, `edges`, and `start` variables remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game played on a tree with exactly two leaves. It accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (the starting node where a stone is placed). The function calculates the distances from the starting node to each of the two leaves and returns 'Ron' if at least one of these distances is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.
