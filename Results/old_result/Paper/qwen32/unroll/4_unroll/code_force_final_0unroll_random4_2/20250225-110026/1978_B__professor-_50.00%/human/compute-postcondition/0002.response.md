To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each iteration based on the given conditions:

1. **If `b <= a`**: The total cost is `n * a` because the modified price `b` is not cheaper than the usual price `a`.
2. **If `b - a >= n`**: The total cost is calculated using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 until `b - n + 1`.
3. **If neither of the above conditions is true**: The total cost is calculated using the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula calculates the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, plus the usual price `a` for the remaining buns.

After each iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input and the corresponding total cost is printed. The variable `t` (the number of test cases) determines how many times the loop will run.

Since the loop does not modify `t` and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are read anew in each iteration, the final state of `t` remains unchanged. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values from the last iteration after the loop finishes.

Given that the problem asks for the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, the output state will reflect the state of `t` and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the last iteration.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n`, `a`, and `b` hold the values from the last iteration.**
