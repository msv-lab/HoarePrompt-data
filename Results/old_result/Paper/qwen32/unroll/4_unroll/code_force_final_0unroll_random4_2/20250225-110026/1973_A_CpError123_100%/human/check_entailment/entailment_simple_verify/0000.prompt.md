You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is intended to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players. Here's the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))
```

### Key Points from the Problem Description

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The total points awarded in a game are always even (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw).
2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws can be determined based on the total points and the scores of the players.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Check for Even Total Points**:
   - The code correctly checks if the total points `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` and returns `-1` if the total points are odd, which is correct because an odd total implies an impossible score distribution.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The code calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the total number of games played.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`, which represents the combined score of the two lower-scoring players.
   - The maximum number of draws is taken as `min(x, y)`. 

### Potential Issues

Let's verify if the code handles all edge cases and potential scenarios:

- **No Games Played** (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`):
  - Total points = 0, which is even.
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `min(x, y) = 0` → Correct.
  
- **One Draw** (`a = 0, b = 1, c = 1`):
  - Total points = 2, which is even.
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `min(x, y) = 1` → Correct.
  
- **Impossible Scores** (`a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`):
  - Total points = 3, which is odd → Correctly returns `-1`.

- **Multiple Draws** (`a = 3, b = 3, c = 3`):
  - Total points = 9, which is odd → Correctly returns `-1`.

- **Valid Scores with Draws** (`a = 3, b = 4, c = 5`):
  - Total points = 12, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 7`, `min(x, y) = 6` → Correct.

- **Another Valid Case** (`a = 1, b = 1, c = 10`):
  - Total points = 12, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 2`, `min(x, y) = 2` → Correct.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code and testing various scenarios, it appears that the program correctly handles all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. The logic for determining the maximum number of draws and checking for impossible scores is implemented correctly.

**Correctness: True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
