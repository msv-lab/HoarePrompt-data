You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves selling `n` buns with a possible promotion where the first `k` buns can be sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing an optimal `k`.

### Key Observations
1. If `a >= b`, it is always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the promotion price cannot be higher than the usual price.
2. If `a < b`, we need to find the optimal `k` to maximize profit. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, and the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution follows these steps:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `a >= b`, print `n * a` because it's better to sell all buns at the usual price.
4. If `a < b`, calculate the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures we do not sell more buns at the promotional price than the number of buns available or the number of prices available.
5. Calculate the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
6. Calculate the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
7. Print the total profit `ans + p2`.

### Correctness
The solution correctly handles both cases (`a >= b` and `a < b`). It calculates the optimal `k` and computes the profit accordingly. The arithmetic series sum formula used is correct for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
