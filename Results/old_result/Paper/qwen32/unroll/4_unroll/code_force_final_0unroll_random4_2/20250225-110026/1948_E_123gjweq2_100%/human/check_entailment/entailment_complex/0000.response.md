### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices of a graph.
   - An edge is added between vertices i and j if the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied.
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the assignment, the number of cliques, and the partition.

2. **Key Points of the Provided Program:**
   - The program calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of \( n / k \).
   - It then fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in a specific way using the `make_array` function.
   - The `make_array` function fills the `arr` array with a sequence of increasing and decreasing numbers and assigns the same clique number to the vertices in the range.

3. **Verification Steps:**
   - **Number of Cliques:** The calculated number of cliques is the ceiling of \( n / k \), which is reasonable as it ensures that each clique can have at most k vertices, minimizing the number of cliques.
   - **Assignment and Partition:** The `make_array` function ensures that vertices within the same range (up to k vertices) are assigned consecutive numbers and the same clique number. This should satisfy the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for vertices within the same range.
   - **Distinctness:** The `arr` array is filled with distinct numbers from 1 to n, ensuring that each vertex is assigned a unique integer.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - The output format matches the required format: a list of n integers, the number of cliques, and a list of n integers representing the partition.
   - The provided example outputs seem correct based on the described logic.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly assign integers to vertices, calculate the number of cliques, and partition the graph based on the given conditions. The logic within `func_1` and `make_array` seems to meet the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
