### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. Let's break down the logic of the program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position for Kirill).
   - It also reads two lists `a` and `b` of length `n` which represent the costs for Kirill to bribe people and the additional costs for people between the briber and bribed person, respectively.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `c` is created as a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. This is because Kirill can either bribe the person directly (cost `a[i]`) or pay the additional cost `b[i]` to the person between him and the person he wants to bribe.
   - `suff` is a suffix sum array where `suff[i]` is the sum of the elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. This is used to quickly calculate the sum of the minimum costs for all people after position `i`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity.
   - It then iterates over the first `m` positions (from `0` to `m-1`), calculating the cost for Kirill to move to each of these positions. The cost to move to position `i` is `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, which is the cost to bribe the person at position `i` plus the sum of the minimum costs for all people after position `i`.
   - The minimum of these costs is stored in `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Correctness Analysis:

The logic of the program seems correct based on the problem description. However, there is a discrepancy in the variable names used in the problem description and the annotated program. Specifically, the problem description mentions `m` as the maximum allowable final position for Kirill, but the annotated program uses `k` in place of `m`. Given that the code uses `k` and the problem description uses `m`, and assuming `k` is meant to be `m`, the logic appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic is correct, assuming `k` is meant to be `m` as per the problem description. Therefore, the program should work as intended.

**Correctness: True**
