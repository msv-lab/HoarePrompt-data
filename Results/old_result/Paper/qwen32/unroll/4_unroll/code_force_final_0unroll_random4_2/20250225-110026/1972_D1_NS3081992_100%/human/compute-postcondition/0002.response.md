Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1; `ans` is 0.**

The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are the outputs of `func_7()`. The value of `i` remains 1. The new variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
