Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n x n matrix filled with zeroes. For each test case, the function returns the n x n matrix filled with zeroes. The total number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is also considered, with the sum of n^2 over all test cases not exceeding 5 * 10^5.**
