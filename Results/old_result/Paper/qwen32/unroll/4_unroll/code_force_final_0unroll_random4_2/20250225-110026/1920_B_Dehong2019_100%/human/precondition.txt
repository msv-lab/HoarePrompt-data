t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, k, x) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each a_i in the list. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
