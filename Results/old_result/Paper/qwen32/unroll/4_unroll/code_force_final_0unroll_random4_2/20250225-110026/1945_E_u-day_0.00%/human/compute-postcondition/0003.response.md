The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is `n_new`, `k` is `k_new`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1. 

To ensure the loop executes, `n_new` must be greater than 0. The variables `k_new`, `arr`, and `pos` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted in terms of the loop's ability to execute.

State: **`n` is `n_new` (must be greater than 0), `k` is `k_new`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**
