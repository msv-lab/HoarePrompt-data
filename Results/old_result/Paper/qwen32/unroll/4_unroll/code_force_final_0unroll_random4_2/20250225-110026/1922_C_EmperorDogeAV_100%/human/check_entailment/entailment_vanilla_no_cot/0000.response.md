Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that lead to incorrect results:

1. **Indexing and Off-by-One Errors**: The program seems to have off-by-one errors in handling indices. For example, in the `func_1` function, the `prog_cities` list is indexed from 0 to n-2, but the logic to compute the closest city distances should consider all cities from 0 to n-1. This could lead to incorrect closest city assignments.

2. **Logic for Closest City**: The `func_1` function does not correctly determine the closest city for each city. The logic should compare the distances to both the previous and next city correctly and assign the minimum distance or 1 if the closest city is the next one. However, the current logic does not handle the last city correctly.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are used to calculate the minimum coins needed to travel between cities. However, the prefix sum calculation is not correctly aligned with the closest city logic. The prefix sums should reflect the accumulated cost of traveling through the closest cities.

4. **Reversing Cities**: The program reverses the cities list to compute the backward closest cities. However, the logic for computing the closest cities should be consistent and not rely on reversing the list, as this can introduce additional errors.

5. **Handling Queries**: The queries are handled by checking if `a < b` or `a > b` and then using the prefix sums accordingly. However, the prefix sums are not correctly computed to reflect the minimum coins needed to travel between cities.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly determine the closest city for each city, compute the prefix sums accurately, and handle the queries correctly based on the computed closest cities and their associated costs.
