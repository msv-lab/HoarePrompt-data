### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine whether the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print "YES" if there exists a partition of `s` such that each part is not a palindrome, otherwise print "NO".
   - If the answer is "YES", print the number of parts `k` and the `k` substrings that form the partition.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The string `s` can be up to 10^6 characters long.
   - The sum of lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

#### Function Analysis:
- **`func_1(s)`:**
  - This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
  - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

- **`func_2()`:**
  - This function reads a string `s` from the input.
  - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
    - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `1`, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
  - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character `s[i]` that is different from `s[0]`.
    - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO" because the entire string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
  - If such a character is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
    - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
    - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of `s`).
      - If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it cannot form a valid partition.
      - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly checks if a string is a palindrome.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles the case where the entire string is not a palindrome.
- The function `func_2` correctly identifies when a string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles cases where the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings.
- The function `func_2` correctly identifies edge cases where the string cannot be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings.

However, there is a logical flaw in the function `func_2`:
- When `x` is found and `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the function should attempt to find another valid partition rather than immediately concluding "NO". For example, if `s` is "llllllllll", the function should return "YES", `2`, "lll" and "lllll" rather than "NO".

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when a valid partition exists but the function incorrectly concludes "NO". Therefore, the program is not correct as per the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
