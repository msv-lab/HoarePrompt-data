The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Therefore, the value of `t` is updated to the integer that is input, while the other variables (`n` and the constraints) remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2. No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).**
