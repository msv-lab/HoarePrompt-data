Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the cube at the k-th position after sorting, and the k-th position is not the last position in the list. In such a case, the program should output "MAYBE" if there are cubes with the same value as the favorite cube both before and after the k-th position. However, the current implementation incorrectly outputs "YES" in this scenario.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 3
3 3 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
MAYBE
```

**Explanation:**
- The favorite cube's value is 3 (at index 2).
- After sorting, the list remains [3, 3, 3, 3, 3].
- The value at the 3rd position (k=2, 0-based index) after sorting is also 3.
- Since the favorite cube's value is equal to the value at the k-th position, and there are cubes with the same value both before and after the k-th position, the output should be "MAYBE".

However, the provided program will output "YES" for this case, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
