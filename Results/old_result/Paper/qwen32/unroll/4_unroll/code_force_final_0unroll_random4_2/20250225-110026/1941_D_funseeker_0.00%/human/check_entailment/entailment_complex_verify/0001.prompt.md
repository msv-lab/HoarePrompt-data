You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_1` does not take any parameters and returns a string, which is a stripped line read from standard input.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is a stripped line read from standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters in its signature, so there are no variables or relationships to describe.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by the function `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by the function `func_1()`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, and it implicitly relies on the return value of `func_1()`, which is expected to return a string that can be split into a list of integers.
def func_3():

    #The program returns a list of integers, which are the result of splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each split substring into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no parameters. It processes the string returned by `func_1()` by splitting it into substrings and converting each substring into an integer. The function then returns a list of these integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n. r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and c is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.

    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)

    #State: `ans` is a set of integers that have been transformed through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `ans` is a set of integers that have been transformed through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations. If `0` was an element in `ans` before the if statement, it is no longer an element in `ans` and `n` is an element in `ans`. If `0` was not an element in `ans`, no changes are made to `ans`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of elements in the set `ans` after the described transformations)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: n [other elements of ans excluding 0] (where n is definitely in ans and 0 is not in ans if it was originally present)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a series of transformations on an initial set containing a single integer `x` by adding or subtracting a value `r` modulo `n` based on the character `c`. After `m` iterations, it adjusts the set by replacing `0` with `n` if `0` is present. The function then outputs the number of elements in the final set and the elements themselves, ensuring `0` is not present and `n` is included if necessary.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players (`n`), the number of throws (`m`), and the starting player (`x`).
   - It then reads `m` lines of input for each test case, where each line contains a distance (`r`) and a direction (`c`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It creates a temporary set `temp` to store possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it calculates the new position by adding `r` to the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it calculates the new position by subtracting `r` from the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

3. **Handling Modulo Operation:**
   - The program uses the modulo operation to wrap around the circle. However, it checks if `0` is in `ans` and replaces it with `n` if necessary. This is because in a circle, position `0` is equivalent to position `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all throws, the program prints the number of possible positions in `ans`.
   - It then prints the sorted list of possible positions.

### Evaluation

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for calculating the new positions based on the direction is correct.
  - The use of a set to track possible positions is appropriate because it handles duplicates naturally.
  - The handling of the modulo operation and the conversion from `0` to `n` is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where the direction is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities.
  - It correctly processes the input for multiple test cases.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The output format matches the problem description, with the number of possible positions followed by the sorted list of positions.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after the throws, considering the given constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: **True**
