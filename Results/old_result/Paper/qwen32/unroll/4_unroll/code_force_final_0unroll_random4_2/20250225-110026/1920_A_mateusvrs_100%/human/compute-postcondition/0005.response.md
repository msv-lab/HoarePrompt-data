Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a list of constraints. Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x), where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2. No two constraints are the same. The function returns a result for each test case based on these constraints.**
