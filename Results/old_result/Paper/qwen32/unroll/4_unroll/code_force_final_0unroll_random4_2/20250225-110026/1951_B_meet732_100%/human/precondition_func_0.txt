a is a list containing multiple test cases. Each test case is represented as a list where the first element is a list of two integers [n, k] with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the second element is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where each rating is a unique integer between 1 and 10^9. The total number of cows across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
