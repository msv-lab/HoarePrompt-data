You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n positive integers where 2 <= n <= 50, and each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: - After the loop completes, `idx` will have been incremented by `1 + n1 + 1 + n2 + 1 + ... + nk + 1`, where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` in each iteration.
    #   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    #   - `a` will be the last list of integers processed in the loop.
    #   - `results` will contain the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.
    #   - `data` remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
    #
    #Thus, the output state can be described as:
    #- `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop.
    #- `data` remains the same as the input.
    #- `idx` is incremented by `1 + n1 + 1 + n2 + 1 + ... + nk + 1` where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the values of `n` in each iteration.
    #- `t` remains the same as the input.
    #- `results` contains the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.
    #
    #Output State:
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultk (where result1, result2, ..., resultk are the results of func_1(a) for each iteration of the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` positive integers where `2 <= n <= 50`, and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`. The function returns the maximum value in the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
