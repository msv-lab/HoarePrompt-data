### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `result` to store the number of screens required for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It calculates the total space occupied by the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y`).
   - It calculates the total space required (`total_space`).

3. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - It calculates the number of screens required just for the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`).
     - If `y` is even, it needs `y // 2` screens because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3 grid).
     - If `y` is odd, it needs `y // 2 + 1` screens because the remaining 2x2 icon will require an additional screen.
   - It calculates the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells`).

4. **Calculating Extra Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, it appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the extra space needed for the 1x1 icons (`extra_space`).
   - It calculates the number of extra screens required for these 1x1 icons (`extra_screen`).
     - If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, it needs `extra_space // 15` additional screens.
     - Otherwise, it needs `extra_space // 15 + 1` additional screens.
   - It appends the total number of screens (`extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`) to the result.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with one of the test cases:

**Test Case**:
- Input: `7 2`
- Expected Output: `1`

**Execution**:
- `x = 7`, `y = 2`
- `space_x = 7 * 1 = 7`
- `space_y = 2 * 4 = 8`
- `total_space = 8 + 7 = 15`
- `screen_require_for_y = 2 // 2 = 1`
- `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
- Since `space_x` (7) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` (7), it appends `screen_require_for_y` (1) to the result.

The program correctly calculates that one screen is sufficient for 7 1x1 icons and 2 2x2 icons.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program and verifying it with a test case, it appears that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
