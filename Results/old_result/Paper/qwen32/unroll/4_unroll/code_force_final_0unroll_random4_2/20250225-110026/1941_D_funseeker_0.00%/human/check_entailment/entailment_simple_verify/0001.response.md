### Reasoning:

Let's review the provided program and annotations to ensure the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads each throw's distance and direction using `func_1()`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It creates a temporary set `temp` to store possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it calculates the new position by adding `r` to the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it calculates the new position by subtracting `r` from the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

3. **Handling Modulo Operation:**
   - The program correctly uses the modulo operation to wrap around the circle.
   - The check for `0` in `ans` and replacing it with `n` is a bit unusual but correct. In a circle, position `0` is equivalent to position `n`. However, in the context of this problem, positions are numbered from `1` to `n`, so `0` should never be a valid position. The program ensures that if `0` appears in `ans`, it is replaced with `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all throws, the program prints the number of possible positions in `ans`.
   - It then prints the sorted list of possible positions.

### Evaluation

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for calculating the new positions based on the direction is correct.
  - The use of a set to track possible positions is appropriate because it handles duplicates naturally.
  - The handling of the modulo operation and the conversion from `0` to `n` is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where the direction is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities.
  - It correctly processes the input for multiple test cases.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The output format matches the problem description, with the number of possible positions followed by the sorted list of positions.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after the throws, considering the given constraints and requirements. The annotations and the original assessment both validate the correctness of the program.

**Final: True**
