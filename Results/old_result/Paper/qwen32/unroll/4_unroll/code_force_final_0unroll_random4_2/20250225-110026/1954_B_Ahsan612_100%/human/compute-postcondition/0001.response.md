To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to analyze the given loop and its effect on the variables.

The loop processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. The code then iterates through the list to find the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers, excluding the case where the entire list is a single segment (i.e., all elements are the same).

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the loop's effect:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the variables `same`, `num`, and `minn` are initialized. `same` counts the length of the current segment of identical numbers, `num` stores the current number being counted, and `minn` is set to infinity (`inf`), representing the smallest segment length found so far.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates through the list `ar` starting from the second element (index 1). If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`. If the current element is different, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.

3. **Final Update**: After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time to account for the last segment in the list.

4. **Output Decision**: If `minn` is still infinity (meaning no segments were found, which is impossible given the problem constraints) or if `minn` equals the length of the list (meaning the entire list is a single segment), the code prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

After all test cases are processed, the variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, `i`, `ar`, and `n` will be in their final state for the last test case processed. However, since the problem asks for the output state in terms of the variables in the loop head and body, we need to consider the final state of these variables after the last iteration.

**Output State:**
- `same` will be 1 (since it is reset to 1 whenever a new segment starts and the loop ends after processing the last segment).
- `num` will be the last number in the last test case's list `ar`.
- `minn` will be the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers found in the last test case, or `-1` if the entire list was a single segment.
- `i` will be equal to the length of the last test case's list `ar` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list).
- `ar` will be the list of integers from the last test case.
- `n` will be the length of the last test case's list.

Output State: **same is 1, num is the last number in the last test case's list, minn is the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers found in the last test case or -1, i is the length of the last test case's list, ar is the list of integers from the last test case, n is the length of the last test case's list.**
