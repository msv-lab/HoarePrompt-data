### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This helps in easily identifying the smallest and largest elements, which is crucial for Alice and Bob's optimal strategies.

2. **Alice's Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array by removing at most `k` elements. 
   - Since the array is sorted, the optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the smallest `k` elements, as these would contribute the least to the sum.

3. **Bob's Strategy:**
   - Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array by multiplying at most `x` elements by -1.
   - Bob's optimal strategy would be to flip the sign of the `x` largest elements (after Alice's removals), as these would have the maximum impact on reducing the sum.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Possible Sum:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the possible sums after different numbers of removals by Alice and flips by Bob.
   - It iterates through all possible numbers of removals (`i` from 0 to `k`), updating the sum `s` after each removal.
   - For each number of removals, it calculates the sum after flipping the appropriate number of largest elements.
   - The function keeps track of all these possible sums in the list `pos` and returns the maximum value.

5. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach ensures that all possible scenarios of Alice's and Bob's moves are considered.
   - By sorting the array and iterating through all possible removals and flips, the function `func_2` correctly computes the maximum possible sum after both players play optimally.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the optimal sum after both Alice and Bob play optimally. It considers all possible scenarios and correctly computes the result.

**Correctness: True**
