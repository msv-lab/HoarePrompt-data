### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem involves determining the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities on a number line. Cities are given in ascending order, and for each city, there is a uniquely determined closest city. Traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin, while traveling directly to another city costs the distance between them in coins.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of these cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It splits the city coordinates into a list and converts them to integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city, except the last one in the given direction.
   - The function iterates through the cities and for each city, it checks the distance to the previous and next city.
   - It assigns a cost of 1 if the closest city is the next one, otherwise, it assigns the distance to the closest city.
   
3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to travel to the closest city starting from the first city.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost to travel to the closest city starting from the last city (in reverse).

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sums to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sums to calculate the cost.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Function `func_1` Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost for each city to travel to its closest city.
   - The function handles the last city incorrectly, as it does not have a forward neighbor. However, the annotations and the code logic seem to imply that the last city should always have a cost of 1 to its previous city, which is correct if the closest city is always in the backward direction.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for determining the cost to travel to the closest city for each city except the last one, and for the last city, it assumes the cost is 1 to the previous city.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the costs provided by `func_1`.
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of `prog_cities` after `func_1` is called, indicating that the prefix sums are correctly calculated based on the costs returned by `func_1`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program uses the prefix sums to determine the cost to travel between cities.
   - The logic for using the forward and backward prefix sums is correct based on the direction of travel.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The annotations confirm that `func_1` correctly calculates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city.
- The annotations confirm that the prefix sums are correctly calculated based on the costs returned by `func_1`.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities based on the given problem description and the annotations. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city, and the prefix sums are correctly calculated based on these costs. The query processing logic is also correct.

**Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
