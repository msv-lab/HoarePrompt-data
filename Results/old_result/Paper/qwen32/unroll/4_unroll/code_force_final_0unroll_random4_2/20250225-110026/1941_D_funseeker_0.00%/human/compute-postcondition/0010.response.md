Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers representing dimensions, `x` is an integer representing a position, `r` is an integer representing another position constraint, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'. The function returns a value based on these inputs, with specific cases handling different values of `c`. If `c` is '0', it returns one result; if `c` is '1', it returns another result; and if `c` is '?', it returns a third result.**
