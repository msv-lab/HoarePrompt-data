Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
- A beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements using the specified operation.
- If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should output `-1`.

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers.
- If the entire array consists of a single segment of identical numbers, it returns `-1`.
- Otherwise, it returns the minimum length of these segments.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code aims to find the smallest segment of consecutive identical numbers within the array. If the smallest segment is of size 1 or the entire array is identical, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the size of the smallest segment.

#### Key Points:
1. **Finding the Smallest Segment**:
   - The code iterates through the array and counts consecutive identical elements.
   - It updates the minimum segment size (`minn`) whenever a different element is encountered.
   - Finally, it checks the last segment after the loop.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The array is already non-beautiful, so it correctly returns `-1`.
   - **Array with All Elements Identical**: The smallest segment size is the length of the array, so it correctly returns `-1`.
   - **Array with Different Elements**: The smallest segment size is correctly calculated and returned.

### Testing the Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case where the smallest group is at the end of the array correctly. Let's verify this:

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  5
  1 2 2 2 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `1`
- **Explanation**: Removing any `2` will make the array non-beautiful.

#### Code Behavior:
- The code will iterate through the array:
  - `i=1`: `same=1`, `num=1`
  - `i=2`: `same=1`, `num=2`, `minn=min(inf, 1) = 1`, `same=1`
  - `i=3`: `same=2`, `num=2`
  - `i=4`: `same=3`, `num=2`
  - `i=5`: `same=3`, `num=1`, `minn=min(1, 3) = 1`, `same=1`
- After the loop, `minn=min(1, 1) = 1`.
- Since `minn` is not `inf` or the length of the array, it prints `1`.

The code correctly identifies the smallest segment size and handles the test case provided in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not handle the case where the smallest group is at the end of the array. The provided code correctly calculates the smallest segment size and handles this case.

**Final Evaluation: Final: **True**
