You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` number of lines, each representing the count of transitions between '0' and '1' in the respective input string `s`. If the string is non-decreasing (i.e., no '1' is preceded by a '0'), the count is incremented by 1. Variables `t`, `s`, `count`, and `flag` do not retain their values after the loop; `t` remains the initial integer input, and `s` is the last input string processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic in the context of the problem description. The task is to find the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string needs to be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all 0s followed by all 1s).

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of pieces such that rearranging these pieces results in a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all 0s before all 1s.
   - The pieces are contiguous substrings of the original string.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The transition from 0 to 1 indicates a potential cut point because, in a sorted string, 0s should come before 1s.
   - The number of cuts needed is equivalent to the number of transitions from 0 to 1 plus one (for the initial piece).

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 0, which will count the number of transitions from 0 to 1.
   - It initializes `flag` to 0, which checks if there is any transition from 0 to 1.
   - It iterates through the string and increments `count` every time there is a transition from 0 to 1.
   - It sets `flag` to 1 if there is a transition from 0 to 1.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is 0 (meaning no transition from 0 to 1 was found), it prints `count + 1`. This is because even if there are no transitions, the string is already sorted, and hence, one piece is enough.
   - If `flag` is 1, it prints `count`, which is the number of transitions (potential cut points).

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of cuts needed by counting the transitions from 0 to 1.
   - It handles the edge case where there are no transitions (the string is already sorted) by adding one to the count.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.
