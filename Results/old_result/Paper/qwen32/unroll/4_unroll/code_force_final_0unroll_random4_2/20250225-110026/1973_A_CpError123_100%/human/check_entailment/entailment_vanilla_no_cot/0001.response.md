Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Total Points Constraint**:
   - The total points among the three players must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If the total points are even, the maximum number of draws can be calculated based on the total points and the points of the two players with the lowest scores. Specifically, the maximum number of draws is the minimum of:
     - Half of the total points (since each draw contributes 2 points).
     - The sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores (since each draw involves two players).

3. **Invalid Cases**:
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to distribute the points according to the rules, so the output should be -1.
   - If the points don't fit the constraints described above, the output should also be -1.

### Program Analysis:
- The program correctly checks if the total points are even. If not, it outputs -1, which is correct.
- It calculates the total points and then calculates `x` as half of the total points and `y` as the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores.
- The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which is the correct approach to find the maximum number of draws.

### Specific Cases:
- **Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Total points: 0 (even)
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0`
  - Output: `0` (correct)
- **Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Total points: 2 (even)
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - Output: `1` (correct)
- **Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Total points: 3 (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (correct)
- **Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Total points: 4 (even)
  - `x = 2`, `y = 2`
  - Output: `2` (correct)
- **Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Total points: 9 (odd)
  - Output: `-1` (correct)
- **Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - `x = 6`, `y = 7`
  - Output: `6` (correct)
- **Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - `x = 6`, `y = 2`
  - Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
