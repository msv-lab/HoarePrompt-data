n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk (1 <= r[i] <= 10^9), and visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized to False and None respectively.
