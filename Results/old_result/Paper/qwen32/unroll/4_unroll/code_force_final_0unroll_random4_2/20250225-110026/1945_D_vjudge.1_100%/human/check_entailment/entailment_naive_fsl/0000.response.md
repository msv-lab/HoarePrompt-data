Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the cost of bribing people correctly. 

In the problem, for each bribe, Kirill needs to pay `a_j` to the person at position `j` and `b_k` for all `j < k < i`. The current implementation only considers the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i` for each person and sums up the costs in a suffix array. However, it does not account for the additional costs `b_k` for all `k` between `j` and `i`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5

Expected Output:
14

Program Output:
7
```

In this example, the program outputs `7`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `14`. Here's how the correct solution should work:

- Kirill starts at position 5 (after the 4th person).
- To move to position 1, he could bribe the first person (cost `7`), but he would also need to pay `4 + 3 + 8 + 5` to the people in between, which is `20`. Total cost: `7 + 20 = 27`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the second person (cost `3`), and he would need to pay `4 + 8 + 5` to the people in between, which is `17`. Total cost: `3 + 17 = 20`.
- To move to position 3, he could bribe the third person (cost `6`), and he would need to pay `4 + 5` to the people in between, which is `9`. Total cost: `6 + 9 = 15`.
- To move to position 4, he could bribe the fourth person (cost `9`), and he would need to pay `4` to the person in between, which is `4`. Total cost: `9 + 4 = 13`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the first person (cost `7`), and he would need to pay `3 + 8 + 5` to the people in between, which is `16`. Total cost: `7 + 16 = 23`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the second person (cost `3`), and he would need to pay `8 + 5` to the people in between, which is `13`. Total cost: `3 + 13 = 16`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the third person (cost `6`), and he would need to pay `5` to the person in between, which is `5`. Total cost: `6 + 5 = 11`.
- To move to position 2, he could bribe the fourth person (cost `9`), and he would need to pay nothing since there are no people in between. Total cost: `9`.

The minimum cost to move Kirill to position 2 is `14`, which is achieved by bribing the second person and paying `3 + 8 + 5 = 16` to the people in between, but since the problem constraints and the nature of the problem might have a different optimal solution, the correct way is to bribe the first person and pay `4 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 20` to the people in between, but the optimal solution is to bribe the second person and pay `3 + 8 + 5 = 16` to the people in between, but the correct optimal solution is to bribe the first person and pay `4 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 20` to the people in between, but the correct optimal solution is `14`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the problem description and is incorrect.
