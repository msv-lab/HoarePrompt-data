In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. This means the loop will execute based on the integer input provided, which represents the number of test cases (`t`).

Let's analyze the given state and the loop:

- **State before the loop starts**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This `t` represents the number of test cases.
- **Loop**: `for _ in range(int(input())):`

The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, and its value does not affect the loop's execution. The critical factor here is the input value, which must be an integer within the range [1, 10^4].

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be a valid integer within the specified range. Since the state before the loop starts already specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, we need to ensure that the input function `int(input())` returns this value.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop variable `_` itself, but we need to ensure that the input value is correctly set to `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `int(input())` returns `t`**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times as intended.
