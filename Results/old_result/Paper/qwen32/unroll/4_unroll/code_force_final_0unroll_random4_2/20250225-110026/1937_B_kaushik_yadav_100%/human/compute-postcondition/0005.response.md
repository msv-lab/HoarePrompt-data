Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a length `n` and two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of a grid. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by alternating characters from the top and bottom strings based on specific conditions and prints this string. It also calculates and prints a counter that represents the length of the longest prefix of the top string that matches the bottom string, with the additional condition that '0' in the top string can match '1' in the bottom string.**
