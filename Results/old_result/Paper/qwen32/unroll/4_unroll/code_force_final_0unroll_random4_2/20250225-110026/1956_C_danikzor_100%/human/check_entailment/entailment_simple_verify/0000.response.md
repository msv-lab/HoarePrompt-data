### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve setting the elements of a row or a column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) can be derived as follows:
- Each row and column should ideally contain the integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once.
- The sum of each row or column would then be \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
- Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the total sum for the matrix would be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

However, the problem description specifies that the maximum possible sum is indeed \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). This formula is derived from the idea of filling the matrix such that each row and column contains distinct integers, and the sum of all elements is maximized.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) and outputs \( 2n \) operations, where each row and each column is set to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

Let's evaluate the correctness of the operations:
1. **Operation Type 1**: Sets the \( i \)-th row to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
2. **Operation Type 2**: Sets the \( i \)-th column to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

The operations described in the program do not guarantee that each row and column will contain distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). Instead, they fill each row and column with the same decreasing sequence, which does not maximize the sum correctly.

However, the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is correct for the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The issue is with the operations, not the calculation of the sum.

#### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each row and column contains distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) in such a way that the sum is maximized. One correct approach is to fill the matrix in a way that each row and each column contains the integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once, ensuring that the sum of each row and each column is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

The provided program's operations do not achieve this. Instead, it fills the matrix with the same decreasing sequence for each row and column, which does not maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations provided do not ensure that each row and column contains distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) in a way that maximizes the sum.

**Final: False**
