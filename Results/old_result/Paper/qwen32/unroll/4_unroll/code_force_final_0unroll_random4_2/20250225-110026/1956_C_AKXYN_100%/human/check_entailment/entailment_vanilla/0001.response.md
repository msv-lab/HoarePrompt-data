Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all numbers in an `n x n` matrix by performing a series of operations. There are two types of operations:
1. Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.

The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values using these operations. Since we can use permutations, the maximum sum for each cell `(i, j)` is `n` (the highest number in a permutation of `1` to `n`).

### Strategy to Maximize the Sum

To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to ensure that each cell in the matrix is filled with the highest possible value, which is `n`. Since each operation can fill a row or a column with a permutation, we can achieve this by filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This way, every cell in the matrix will be filled with `n`.

### Calculating the Maximum Sum

The maximum sum of the matrix is `n * n * n`, as each of the `n * n` cells will contain the value `n`.

### Operations Required

To fill each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, we need `n` operations for the rows and `n` operations for the columns, totaling `2n` operations.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: It initializes a matrix of size `n x n` with each row filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
3. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the matrix using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is incorrect for the problem at hand. The correct sum should be `n * n * n`.
4. **Output**: It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (`2n`), followed by the operations themselves. The operations are correctly described as filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Correctness of the Program

The program correctly identifies the number of operations needed (`2n`) and the operations themselves. However, the sum calculation is incorrect. The program should calculate the sum as `n * n * n` instead of using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation. The operations described are correct, but the sum reported is not the maximum possible sum.

**Correctness: False**
