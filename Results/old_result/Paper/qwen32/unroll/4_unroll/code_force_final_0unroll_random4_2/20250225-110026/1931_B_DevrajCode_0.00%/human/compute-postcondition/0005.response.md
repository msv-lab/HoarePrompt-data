Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, and `total_water % n` equals 0; `target` is `total_water // n`; `container` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `container` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
