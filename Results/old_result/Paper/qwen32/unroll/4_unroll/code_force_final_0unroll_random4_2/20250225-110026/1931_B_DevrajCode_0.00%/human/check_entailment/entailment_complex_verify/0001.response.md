Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the program's correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.
- The sum of the water in all containers is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element in the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
   - The program then calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine if the redistribution is possible.

2. **Function `func_1(n, a)`:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the total amount of water `total_water`.
   - **Step 2:** Check if `total_water` is divisible by `n`. This is already guaranteed by the problem, so this step is redundant but does no harm.
   - **Step 3:** Calculate the target amount of water each container should have `target = total_water // n`.
   - **Step 4:** Initialize a variable `container` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target.
   - **Step 5:** Iterate through each container's water amount:
     - Update `container` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the target.
     - If `container` becomes negative at any point, return 'No'. This means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to meet the target for the current container.
   - **Step 6:** If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, return 'Yes'. This means that it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount.

### Annotations and Logic Verification:
- **State Before Function Call:** `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), and the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, and `total_water % n` equals 0.
  - `target` is the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
  - `container` is initialized to 0.
  - For each water amount in `a`, `container` is updated by adding the difference between the current water amount and `target`.
  - If at any point `container` becomes negative, the function returns 'No'.
  - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The key logic is to ensure that at no point do we have less water than the target amount required for the current container and all previous containers. This is correctly captured by the `container` variable, which tracks the cumulative difference.
- If `container` ever becomes negative, it means that there isn't enough water in the previous containers to meet the target for the current container, and thus redistribution is not possible.
- If `container` never becomes negative, it means that we can redistribute the water to meet the target for all containers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The annotations and the logic verification confirm that the program behaves as expected.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks if it is possible to redistribute the water such that no container ever has less water than the target amount during the process. This ensures that the operation constraints are respected.
Final: **True**
