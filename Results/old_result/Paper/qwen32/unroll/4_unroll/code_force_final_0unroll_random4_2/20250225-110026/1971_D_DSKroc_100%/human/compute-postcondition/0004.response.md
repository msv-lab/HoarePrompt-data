Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`. If the string is non-decreasing (i.e., no '1' is preceded by a '0'), it increments the count by 1. The function outputs `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case.**
