Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks, respectively. `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and `visited[i]` is True. `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component and now includes `i`. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of values that will be used to store coefficients for the system of equations representing the constraints on the radii.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
