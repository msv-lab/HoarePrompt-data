The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `j`. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively; `a` is a binary string read from the input; `b` is a binary string read from the input; `k` is 0; `j` is 0.**
