Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**: The function `func_1` truncates frequencies to `k` which is incorrect. The frequency should not be truncated; instead, the number of cards that can be reduced based on the frequency should be calculated.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. The program does not correctly calculate how many cards can be exchanged and reduced based on the frequency of each card.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle cases where the number of cards `n` is less than `k` or when all cards are of the same number.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Example Input:**
```
1
6 3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We can exchange 3 cards of number 1 for 2 cards of any number.
- After one exchange, we have 3 cards of number 1 left.
- We can exchange these 3 cards again for 2 cards of any number.
- Now we have 2 cards left.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
The provided program will not correctly compute this and will likely output an incorrect result.

To fix the program, we need to correctly calculate the number of cards that can be reduced based on the frequency of each card and the number `k`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    remaining_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        remaining_cards += count % k
    
    # If no cards are remaining, we need at least one card
    if remaining_cards == 0:
        remaining_cards = k
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards that can be left by considering the remainder of the frequency of each card when divided by `k`.
