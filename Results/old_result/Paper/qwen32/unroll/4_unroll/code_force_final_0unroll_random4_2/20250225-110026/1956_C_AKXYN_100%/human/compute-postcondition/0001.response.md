To determine the output state after executing the given loop, let's break down the code and understand its behavior for each test case.

### Code Analysis

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: For each test case, an `n x n` matrix `mat` is created, where each row is filled with numbers from 1 to `n`.
3. **Calculation of `res`**: The variable `res` is calculated using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
4. **Printing `res` and `n << 1`**: The value of `res` and `n * 2` are printed.
5. **Inner Loop**: For each `i` from `n` to 1, two lines are printed:
   - The first line starts with `1 i` followed by numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - The second line starts with `2 i` followed by numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Output State

For each test case, the output consists of:
1. A single line with the value of `res` and `n * 2`.
2. `2 * n` lines, each consisting of a command (`1` or `2`), an index `i`, and numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Example Calculation

Let's consider a simple example with `t = 1` and `n = 3`:

1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - `mat = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]`
   
2. **Calculation of `res`**:
   - `res = (1 * 1) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 5) = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22`
   
3. **Printing `res` and `n << 1`**:
   - `print(22, 6)`

4. **Inner Loop**:
   - `print('1 3 1 2 3')`
   - `print('2 3 1 2 3')`
   - `print('1 2 1 2 3')`
   - `print('2 2 1 2 3')`
   - `print('1 1 1 2 3')`
   - `print('2 1 1 2 3')`

### General Output State

For each test case with size `n`, the output will be:
- One line with the calculated `res` and `n * 2`.
- `2 * n` lines with the specified format.

Thus, the output state after all test cases have been processed is a series of outputs for each test case as described above.

### Final Output State

Output State: **For each test case with size `n`, the output consists of one line with `res` and `n * 2`, followed by `2 * n` lines with the specified format.**
