Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. Since each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2-0 or 1-1), the total points must be even. If the sum is odd, the program immediately prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Checking Maximum Possible Draws:**
   - The program then checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If this condition holds, it means that the player with the highest score could have won all games against the other two players. In this case, the maximum number of draws would be `p1 + p2` because the player with the highest score could have drawn with each of the other two players the number of times they scored.
   - If the above condition is not met, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws possible. It initializes `x` to 0 and `y` to `p3`. The loop continues as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Inside the loop, it checks if the remaining points for `p1` after `x` draws is less than or equal to the remaining points for `p2` after `y` draws. If this condition is met, it means it's possible to have `x` draws between `p1` and `p3` and `y` draws between `p2` and `p3`, with the remaining points being distributed as wins. The program then prints the total number of draws `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid distribution, the program prints `p3`, which is the maximum number of draws possible given the constraints.

### Analysis of Edge Cases

- **No Games Played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`):** The program correctly returns `0` because no draws can occur without any games.
- **One Draw (`p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`):** The program correctly returns `1` because a single draw between the second and third players is possible.
- **Impossible Scores (`p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`):** The program correctly returns `-1` because it's impossible to have all three players with a score of 1 given the scoring rules.
- **Multiple Draws (`p3 >= p1 + p2`):** The program correctly returns `p1 + p2` because the player with the highest score could have drawn with each of the other two players the number of times they scored.
- **Complex Case (`p3 < p1 + p2`):** The program correctly finds the maximum number of draws by iterating through possible distributions of wins and draws.

### Conclusion

The program appears to handle all specified cases correctly, including edge cases and impossible score distributions.

**Correctness: True**
