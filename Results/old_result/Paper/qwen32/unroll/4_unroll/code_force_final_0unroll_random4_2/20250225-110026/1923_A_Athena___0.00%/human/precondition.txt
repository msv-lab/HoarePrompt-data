t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one 1 in the list a, indicating that at least one cell contains a chip.
