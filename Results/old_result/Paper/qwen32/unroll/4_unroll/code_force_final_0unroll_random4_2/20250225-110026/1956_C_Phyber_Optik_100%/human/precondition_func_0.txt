Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n x n matrix a filled with zeroes. The input consists of multiple test cases, with the first line containing the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
