To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved, especially `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `preOne`: An empty list `[]`.
- `totalOne`: An integer `0`.
- `suffZero`: A list `[0, cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters]`.
- `ans`: A list `[calculated values based on positions of '>' and '<' characters]`.

The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack the `ans` list and print each element separated by a space.

Since the exact values of `ans` are described as "calculated values based on positions of '>' and '<' characters," we need to infer what these calculated values could be. However, the initial state does not provide any specific information about the positions of '>' and '<' characters.

Given the lack of specific details about the positions of '>' and '<' characters, we can only describe the output in terms of the `ans` list.

Output: **calculated values based on positions of '>' and '<' characters (where ans is a list of these calculated values)**

If we assume that no specific positions of '>' and '<' characters have been processed to populate `ans`, then `ans` could be an empty list. However, based on the given description, we should consider the general case where `ans` contains some calculated values.

Therefore, the most precise description possible based on the given information is:

Output: **calculated values based on positions of '>' and '<' characters (where ans is a list of these calculated values)**
