Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem efficiently using a sliding window approach. The key idea is to maintain a count of elements from array `a` that are also in array `b` within the current window of length `m`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - `todo` is initialized as a set containing elements of `b`.
   - `done` is initialized as an empty set to keep track of elements from `a` that are in `b` within the current window.
   - `extra` is initialized as an empty set to keep track of elements from `a` that are not in `b`.

2. **First Window**:
   - It processes the first `m` elements of `a` to initialize `done` and `extra`.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it moves it from `todo` to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it adds it to `extra`.
   - It checks if the size of `done` is at least `k` and sets `ans` to 1 if true, otherwise 0.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - It slides the window one element at a time from `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[r]`), it checks if it is in `todo` and updates `done` and `todo` accordingly.
   - It also removes the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[r - m]`) from `done` or `extra`.
   - After updating the window, it checks if the size of `done` is at least `k` and increments `ans` if true.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows for a test case, it prints the value of `ans`.

The program efficiently handles the constraints using sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra`, ensuring that each element is processed in constant time on average. The sliding window technique ensures that each subarray of length `m` is considered only once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program's logic appears to be correct.
