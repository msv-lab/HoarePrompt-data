Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. Here are the issues:

1. **Initialization of `L` and Calculation of `m`**: The list `L` is never populated with any values, and the calculation of `m` and the decrement of `n` do not contribute to the logic needed to solve the problem. The list `L` should store the counts of cards for each multiple of odd numbers, but it remains empty.

2. **Logic for Determining the k-th Card**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly determine the k-th card. The program attempts to use the list `L` to find the range in which the k-th card falls, but since `L` is empty, this logic cannot work.

3. **Printing the k-th Card**: The formula `pow * (2 * k - 1)` is incorrect for determining the k-th card. The program needs to correctly identify the sequence of cards laid down and then find the k-th card in that sequence.

To fix the program, one would need to:

- Correctly calculate the number of cards for each multiple of odd numbers.
- Use this information to determine in which segment the k-th card falls.
- Calculate the exact card number based on the segment and position within that segment.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_kth_card(n, k):
    count = 0
    multiplier = 1
    while True:
        # Calculate the number of odd multiples of the current multiplier
        odd_multiples = (n // (2 * multiplier)) + (1 if n % (2 * multiplier) >= multiplier else 0)
        if count + odd_multiples >= k:
            # k-th card is in this segment
            offset = k - count - 1
            return (2 * offset + 1) * multiplier
        count += odd_multiples
        multiplier += 1

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(find_kth_card(n, k))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version calculates the number of cards for each segment and determines the k-th card correctly.
