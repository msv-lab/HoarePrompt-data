Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the case where the number of universals is not sufficient to fill the remaining spots in the tents required for the extroverts. The function `func_2` also does not handle the case where there are leftover extroverts that cannot be accommodated with the available universals.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

**Test Case:**
```
1
1 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- We have 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly 2 others.
- The 4 extroverts would need 2 tents (since 4 / 3 = 1 with a remainder of 1, meaning 2 tents are needed to accommodate 4 extroverts with 2 in each tent).
- However, we only have 1 universal, which is not enough to fill the remaining spots in the 2 tents required for the extroverts.
- Therefore, it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, and the output should be -1.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `3` for the above test case, which is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the situation where the number of universals is insufficient to fill the remaining spots in the tents required for the extroverts.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
