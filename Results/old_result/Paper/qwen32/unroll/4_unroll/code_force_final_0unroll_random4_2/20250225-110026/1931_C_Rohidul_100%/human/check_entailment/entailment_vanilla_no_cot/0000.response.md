Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. The program attempts to find the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by looking at the longest sequences of equal elements at the start and end of the array. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of a more optimal solution involving a sequence of equal elements in the middle of the array or a different strategy.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `1` because you can make all elements equal to `2` by choosing `i=1`, `j=3`, and `x=2`, which costs `3-1+1=3` burles, but you can also choose `i=1`, `j=2`, and `x=2` to make the array `[2, 2, 3]` for `2` burles and then choose `i=2`, `j=3`, and `x=3` to make the array `[2, 3, 3]` for `2` burles, but the optimal solution is to choose `i=1`, `j=2`, and `x=2` and then choose `i=2`, `j=3`, and `x=2` for a total of `2` burles, but the optimal solution is actually to choose `i=1`, `j=3`, and `x=2` for `3` burles, but the optimal solution is actually to choose `i=2`, `j=2`, and `x=1` and then choose `i=3`, `j=3`, and `x=1` for a total of `1` burles.

The program needs to consider all possible ways to make the array elements equal with a single operation, not just the start and end sequences. A correct solution would involve checking all possible values for `x` and finding the minimum cost to make all elements equal to `x` using the operation described.
