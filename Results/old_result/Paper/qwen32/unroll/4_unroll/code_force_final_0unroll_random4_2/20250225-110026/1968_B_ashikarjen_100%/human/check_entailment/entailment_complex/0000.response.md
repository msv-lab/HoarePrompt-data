### Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to determine the maximum possible number `k` such that the first `k` characters of string `a` form a subsequence of string `b`. The function iterates through each character of string `a` and attempts to find it in string `b` starting from the last found position. If it finds the character, it increments the counter `k` and continues searching from the next position in `b`.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the function's logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` and `m` are the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `a` and `b` are the input binary strings.
   - `k` is initialized to 0 to count the number of matching characters in order.
   - `j` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current position in string `b`.

2. **Iterate through `a`**:
   - For each character `a[i]` in string `a`, the function enters a while loop to find `a[i]` in string `b` starting from position `j`.

3. **Find `a[i]` in `b`**:
   - The while loop increments `j` until it finds `a[i]` in `b` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is found in `b` (i.e., `j < m`), `k` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 to continue searching from the next position in `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is not found in `b` (i.e., `j >= m`), the loop breaks, and the function prints the current value of `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `k`, which is the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification:
Let's verify the function with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `n=5`, `m=4`, `a='10011'`, `b='1110'`
   - Process: 
     - `a[0]='1'` is found at `b[0]`, `k=1`, `j=1`
     - `a[1]='0'` is found at `b[3]`, `k=2`, `j=4`
     - `a[2]='0'` is not found (end of `b`), break
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `n=3`, `m=3`, `a='100'`, `b='110'`
   - Process: 
     - `a[0]='1'` is found at `b[0]`, `k=1`, `j=1`
     - `a[1]='0'` is found at `b[2]`, `k=2`, `j=3`
     - `a[2]='0'` is not found (end of `b`), break
   - Output: `2`

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `n=1`, `m=3`, `a='1'`, `b='111'`
   - Process: 
     - `a[0]='1'` is found at `b[0]`, `k=1`, `j=1`
   - Output: `1`

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `n=4`, `m=4`, `a='1011'`, `b='1111'`
   - Process: 
     - `a[0]='1'` is found at `b[0]`, `k=1`, `j=1`
     - `a[1]='0'` is not found, break
   - Output: `1`

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `n=3`, `m=5`, `a='100'`, `b='11010'`
   - Process: 
     - `a[0]='1'` is found at `b[0]`, `k=1`, `j=1`
     - `a[1]='0'` is found at `b[2]`, `k=2`, `j=3`
     - `a[2]='0'` is found at `b[4]`, `k=3`, `j=5`
   - Output: `3`

6. **Sixth Example**:
   - Input: `n=3`, `m=1`, `a='100'`, `b='0'`
   - Process: 
     - `a[0]='1'` is not found, break
   - Output: `0`

The function correctly computes the maximum `k` for each test case as per the provided examples.
