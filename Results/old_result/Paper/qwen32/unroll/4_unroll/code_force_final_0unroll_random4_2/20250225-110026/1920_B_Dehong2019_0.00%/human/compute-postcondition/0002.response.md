In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop iterates over the range of `t`, meaning it will execute `t` times. Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
