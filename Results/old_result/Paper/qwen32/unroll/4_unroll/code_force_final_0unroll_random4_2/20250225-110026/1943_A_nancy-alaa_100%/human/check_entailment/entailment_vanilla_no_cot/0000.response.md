Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the optimal score for the game based on the described strategy of Alice and Bob. The current implementation only considers the presence of numbers in the array and their counts but does not simulate the optimal moves of the players.

Hereâ€™s a brief analysis of the issues:

1. **Optimal Strategy Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob to maximize or minimize the MEX value. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is determined by the smallest non-negative integer not in the array `c` after all elements are chosen. The program incorrectly assumes that the first number not in `arr` or the first number with a count of 1 will be the MEX, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Handling of Duplicates**: The program does not correctly handle the situation where numbers have duplicates and need to be strategically chosen by Alice and Bob.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the optimal moves of both players. Here's a corrected approach:

- Count the occurrences of each number in the array.
- Simulate the game by considering the optimal moves:
  - Alice will try to add numbers to `c` to maximize the MEX.
  - Bob will try to prevent Alice from doing so by removing numbers strategically.
- The final MEX of `c` will be the result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        mex = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if mpp[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            elif mpp[i] % 2 == 1:
                mex = i + 1
                break
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

This corrected version considers the optimal strategy by checking the counts of each number and determining the smallest MEX that can be achieved given the constraints of the game.
