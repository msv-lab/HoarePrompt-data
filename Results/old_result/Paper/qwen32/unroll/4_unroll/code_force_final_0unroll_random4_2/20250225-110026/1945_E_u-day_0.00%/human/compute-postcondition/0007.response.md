To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that can be adjusted to meet this condition.

Given the initial state:
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute, `low + 1` must be less than `high`. This implies that `1 < high`, or equivalently, `high` must be at least `2`.

Since `high` is `n - 1`, we need `n - 1` to be at least `2`, which means `n` must be at least `3`.

No other variables (`n_new`, `k_new`, `arr`, `pos`, `st`) are involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `n` is at least `3`.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `k` is `k_new`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `-1`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set**
