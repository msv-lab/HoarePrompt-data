Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. The program attempts to find the maximum element in the permutation and then tries to find the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the maximum possible result. However, this approach is not guaranteed to work and may not find the correct pair of indices within the allowed number of queries.

To solve this problem correctly, a more robust strategy is needed. One possible approach is to iteratively narrow down the set of potential candidates for the maximum XOR pair by comparing bitwise OR values of different pairs of elements. This involves a more systematic exploration of the permutation space to identify the pair with the maximum XOR value.

Here is a sketch of a correct approach:

1. **Identify the maximum element**: Use queries to find the maximum element in the permutation.
2. **Identify the second maximum element**: Use queries to find the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the maximum possible result. This may involve comparing bitwise OR values of different pairs of elements.
3. **Refine the search**: If the initial pair does not yield the maximum XOR, refine the search by comparing additional pairs of elements.

A correct implementation would involve a more detailed and systematic approach to ensure that the maximum XOR pair is found within the allowed number of queries. The provided code does not follow this strategy and may fail to find the correct pair in some cases.
