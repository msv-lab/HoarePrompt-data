### Reasoning:

1. **Global Variables**: The annotations confirm that `arr` and `cliquess` are used as global variables within `make_array`. This is indeed an issue, as the function relies on these variables being defined outside its scope, leading to potential `NameError` issues.

2. **Edge Creation Logic**: The program does not explicitly create edges based on the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\). Instead, it assigns values and clique labels without verifying the edge condition. This means the resulting graph might not be correctly partitioned into cliques according to the problem's requirements.

3. **Minimum Clique Partition**: The program assigns vertices to cliques in a straightforward manner without ensuring that the partitioning results in the minimum number of cliques. The logic used does not guarantee that the graph can be partitioned optimally into cliques.

4. **Output Format**: The annotations and the original code indicate that the output is printed directly from within the function `func_1`. While this might work for the given structure, it is not a robust approach for larger or more complex programs.

### Evaluation:

Based on the analysis above, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques based on the edge creation condition. Additionally, the use of global variables and the direct printing of output within the function are poor programming practices.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
