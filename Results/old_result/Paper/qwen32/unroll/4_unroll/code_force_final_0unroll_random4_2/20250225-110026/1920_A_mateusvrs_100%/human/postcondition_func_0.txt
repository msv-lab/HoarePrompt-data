The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints. For each test case, it calculates and returns an integer based on the constraints: if the maximum value from type 1 constraints is greater than the minimum value from type 2 constraints, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns the count of integers within the range defined by these constraints, excluding those specified in type 3 constraints.
