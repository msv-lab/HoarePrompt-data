You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it determines the maximum possible score that can be achieved under certain conditions and prints that value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `p1 <= p2 <= p3`. 

Here's the logic the program follows:
1. If the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd, it is impossible to have a valid set of games because each game results in an even number of points (either 0+2, 1+1, or 2+0). Hence, it prints `-1`.
2. If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means the third player could have won all games against the other two players. In this case, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the third player could have drawn all games with the first and second players.
3. Otherwise, it uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible numbers of draws `x` and `y` between the players and checks if the conditions are satisfied.

### Checking for Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases and see if the program handles them correctly.

1. **No Games Played**:
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly outputs `0` because no games were played.

2. **Single Draw**:
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1` because the second and third players could have drawn one game.

3. **Impossible Scores**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - The program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores.

4. **Two Draws**:
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program correctly outputs `2` because the third player could have drawn one game with the first player and one with the second player.

5. **All Draws**:
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - The program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with draws alone.

6. **Complex Case**:
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - The program correctly outputs `6` because the maximum number of draws is possible given the scores.

7. **Another Complex Case**:
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program correctly outputs `2` because the maximum number of draws is possible given the scores.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it against various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all the scenarios described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies impossible scores and calculates the maximum number of draws for valid scores.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation

The program correctly handles the following scenarios:
- It checks if the total score is even, which is a necessary condition for a valid set of games.
- It correctly identifies the maximum number of draws when `p3 >= p1 + p2`.
- It uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws for other cases, ensuring that the conditions are satisfied.
- It handles edge cases such as no games played, single draws, and impossible scores correctly.
