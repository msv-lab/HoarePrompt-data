The function `f` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function signature should include introverts, extroverts, and universals as parameters. Therefore, the correct precondition is: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ introverts, extroverts, universals ≤ 10^9).
