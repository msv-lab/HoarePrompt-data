You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The following two lines contain the binary strings a and b of lengths n and m. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are the two integers representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively; `a` is a binary string; `b` is a binary string; `k` is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order; `j` is the index in `b` where the search stopped.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in order)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively, followed by the binary strings `a` and `b` themselves. The function performs some operations based on these inputs but does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
