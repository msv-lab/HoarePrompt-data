You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Each query asks whether there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a bitwise XOR of zero. The function outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input as a single string and splits it into a list of strings, `data`.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, reading `n` (the number of elements), `q` (the number of queries), the array `a`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
   - It also uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it immediately appends "YES" to the results list because a subarray with XOR of 0 can trivially be split into any number of parts with XOR 0.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program uses the dictionary `mp` to find the indices where the prefix XOR values `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` occur.
   - It then uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the smallest index in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and the largest index in `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If it finds such indices where the index from `mp[pf[r]]` is less than the index from `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, it appends "YES" to the results list, indicating that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR. Otherwise, it appends "NO".

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Analysis of Correctness

- **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR calculation is correct and efficiently computes the XOR of any subarray in constant time using precomputed values.
- **Query Handling**: The logic for handling each query is correct. The program checks if there is a prefix XOR value that appears both before and after the subarray in question, which would imply that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the XOR of the subarray is 0, which means it can always be split into parts with XOR 0.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
