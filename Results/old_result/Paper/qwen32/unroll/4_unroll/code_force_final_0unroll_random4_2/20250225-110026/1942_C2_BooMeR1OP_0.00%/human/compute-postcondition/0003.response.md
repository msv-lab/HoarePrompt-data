The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1`, each decremented by 1. After sorting, the list `a` will be in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the precondition constraints on these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from input, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, sorted in non-decreasing order.**
