You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` cubes, each showing a value `a_i`.
- One of these cubes, at index `f`, is Dmitry's favorite.
- The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order.
- The first `k` cubes are removed.
- We need to determine if the favorite cube could have been removed, could not have been removed, or could be in either situation.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of cube values `a`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order using `sorted(a, reverse=True)`.

3. **Counting Removed Cubes:**
   - The program counts how many of the first `k` cubes in the sorted list have the same value as the favorite cube using a loop.
   - It also counts the total occurrences of the favorite cube's value in the sorted list.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - If the number of removed cubes with the favorite value equals the total number of cubes with that value, it prints "YES" (meaning the favorite cube was definitely removed).
   - If no cubes with the favorite value were removed, it prints "NO" (meaning the favorite cube was definitely not removed).
   - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE" (meaning the favorite cube could have been removed or not).

### Checking the Logic:
- The logic seems correct in terms of handling the different scenarios:
  - If the favorite cube's value appears only once and it's within the first `k` cubes, it will print "YES".
  - If the favorite cube's value does not appear in the first `k` cubes at all, it will print "NO".
  - If the favorite cube's value appears more than once and some of them are within the first `k` cubes but not all, it will print "MAYBE".

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the cases where `k` is equal to `n` (all cubes are removed) and where `k` is 1 (only the first cube is removed).
- It also handles the case where there is only one cube (`n=1`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the favorite cube could be removed, could not be removed, or could be in either situation based on the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
