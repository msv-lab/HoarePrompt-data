You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

    #State: After all iterations, the variables `t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their initial values, and no further changes are made to them. The variable `no` is not retained as it is local to each iteration. The program will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The matching rules are:
- If a character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in the string must be the same.
- If a character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's logic. Here's why:

1. **Initial Check for `c == a` or `c == b`**:
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If so, it immediately prints "NO".
   - This check is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of a template that could make `a` and `b` match while `c` does not.

2. **Loop Through Characters in `c`**:
   - The program iterates through each character in `c` and checks if the character is not in `a` and not in `b`.
   - If it finds such a character, it prints "YES" and breaks the loop.
   - This logic is flawed because it doesn't consider the possibility of constructing a template that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to construct a template `t` for each test case:
- For each position `i` from 1 to `n`:
  - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different.
  - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be the uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`, ensuring `c[i]` does not match.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to properly construct a template and instead uses incorrect checks.

Correctness: **False**
