The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state describes several variables (`s`, `n`, `x`) and a function call (`func_1(s[x + 1:])`), but none of these variables or the function call are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is not dependent on these variables or the function call.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `s` represents the input string.
2. The variable `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
3. The variable `x` is not equal to -1.
4. The function call `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`.

However, none of these variables or the function call are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2**
