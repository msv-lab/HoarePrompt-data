The code snippet provided initializes an empty list called `results`. The other variables (`a`, `data`, `idx`, and `t`) are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of `n` strings, where each string is the string representation of the corresponding integer in `a`; `idx` is 1; `t` is `a[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
