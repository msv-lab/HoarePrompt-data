The code snippet provided is:

```python
t = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer such that `1 <= t <= 500`. After executing this line, `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user input, while all other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, which satisfies 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100. The list c contains n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 100.**
