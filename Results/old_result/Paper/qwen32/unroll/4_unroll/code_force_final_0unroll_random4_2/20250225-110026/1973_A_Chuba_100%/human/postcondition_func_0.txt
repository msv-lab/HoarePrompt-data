The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs '-1'. Otherwise, it calculates and outputs a specific result based on the formula provided. The input scores and the number of test cases remain unchanged after processing.
