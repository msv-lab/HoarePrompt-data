Precondition: **Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of boxes. The second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
