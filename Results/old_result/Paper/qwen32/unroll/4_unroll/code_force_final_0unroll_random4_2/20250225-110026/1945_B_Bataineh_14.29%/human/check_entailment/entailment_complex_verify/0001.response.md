### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program with a focus on the logic for both cases.

**Case 1: `m < a` or `m < b`**
- If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, the fireworks launched by the installation with the longer interval (`a` or `b`) will never overlap with the fireworks from the other installation in terms of visibility.
- The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would indeed be `2`, one from each installation.
- The program correctly handles this case by outputting `2`.

**Case 2: `m >= a` and `m >= b`**
- If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, the fireworks from both installations can overlap in terms of visibility.
- The number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // a + 1` (including the one launched at `m`).
- Similarly, the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible at the same time is `m // b + 1`.
- However, the fireworks launched at `m` from both installations would be counted twice if we simply add these two quantities.
- Therefore, the correct calculation should be `m // a + m // b + 1` (since the fireworks launched at `m` from both installations would be counted twice in the current formula).

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program overcounts in the second case by adding `2` instead of `1`. The correct formula should be `m // a + m // b + 1`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the overcounting issue in the program. The program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously when `m >= a` and `m >= b` by overcounting.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
