To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `num_tests > 0` is satisfied. The variables `t` and `num_tests` are the only ones mentioned in the loop head, so we can only adjust those.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `num_tests` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is not part of the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted. The only variable we need to consider is `num_tests`.

Therefore, `num_tests` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
