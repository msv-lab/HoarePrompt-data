Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and 2^30 - 1. Each query is a pair of integers (l, r) where 1 <= l < r <= n. The function processes each query and returns the result for each query based on the list `a`.**
