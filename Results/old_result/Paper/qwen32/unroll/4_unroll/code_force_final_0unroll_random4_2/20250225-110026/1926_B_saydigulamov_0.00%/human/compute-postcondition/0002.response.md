To understand the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the given code and the input state.

The code snippet provided is a loop that iterates `a` times. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of a grid, then reads `n` lines of the grid. It checks each line for the presence of '1's and counts them if present, storing these counts in a list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, it prints the list `k`.

Given the constraints, the grid is guaranteed to contain exactly one triangle or exactly one square formed by '1's, and the size of the shape is greater than 1. This means that for a square, all rows will have the same number of '1's, and for a triangle, the number of '1's will increase or decrease consistently.

Let's consider the possible scenarios for the grid:
1. **Square**: All rows will have the same number of '1's.
2. **Triangle**: The number of '1's will either increase or decrease consistently.

Since the code checks if `k[0] == k[1]` and prints `k` if true, this means it will only print the list when the first two rows have the same number of '1's. This scenario will occur if the grid is a square or if the triangle has a specific structure where the first two rows have the same number of '1's.

Given the problem constraints, the output will be the list `k` if the first two rows of the grid have the same number of '1's, indicating a square or a specific triangle structure.

Output State: **the list `k` is printed if the first two rows of the grid have the same number of '1's, otherwise, no output is generated for that test case.**

However, to strictly adhere to the format requested, and assuming the input guarantees that the condition `k[0] == k[1]` is met for all test cases (as the problem states the grid contains exactly one square or triangle with specific properties), we can generalize the output state as follows:

Output State: **the list `k` containing the counts of '1's in each row where the first two counts are equal.**
