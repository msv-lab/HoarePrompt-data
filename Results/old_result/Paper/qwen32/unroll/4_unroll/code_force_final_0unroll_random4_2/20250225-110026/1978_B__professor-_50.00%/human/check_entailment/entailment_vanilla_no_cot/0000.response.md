Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the calculation of the maximum profit. Specifically, the formula used in the `else` block is incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the correct approach:

### Problem Analysis:

Bob's profit depends on the value of `k`, which determines how many buns are sold at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` and how many are sold at the usual price `a`.

1. **If `b <= a`:** All buns should be sold at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any benefit.
2. **If `b - a >= n`:** The maximum possible `k` is `n`, and all buns should be sold at the modified price. The profit is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` down to `b - n + 1`.
3. **If `b - a < n`:** We need to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. This involves selling `k` buns at the modified price and `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Correct Approach:

- **Arithmetic Series Sum:** If `b - a >= n`, the sum of the series from `b` to `b - n + 1` is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `S = n/2 * (first_term + last_term) = n/2 * (b + (b - n + 1)) = n/2 * (2b - n + 1)`.
- **Optimal `k`:** If `b - a < n`, we need to consider the sum of the first `k` terms of the series `(b, b-1, ..., b-k+1)` and the remaining `n-k` terms at price `a`. The profit can be maximized by finding the optimal `k` where the sum of the first `k` terms of the decreasing series plus the sum of the remaining `n-k` terms at price `a` is maximized.

### Corrected Code:

The corrected code should calculate the profit for each case correctly. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum profit by iterating over possible k values
            max_profit = 0
            for k in range(n + 1):
                profit = sum(b - i for i in range(k)) + a * (n - k)
                if profit > max_profit:
                    max_profit = profit
            print(max_profit)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

However, the above approach can be optimized to avoid iterating over all possible `k` values. The optimal `k` can be determined by the point where the modified price equals the usual price `a`, i.e., `b - k + 1 = a` or `k = b - a + 1`. This can be used to directly compute the maximum profit without iterating over all values of `k`.

### Optimized Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)  # Optimal k
            profit = sum(b - i for i in range(k)) + a * (n - k)
            print(profit)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This optimized code correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case. Therefore, the original program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
