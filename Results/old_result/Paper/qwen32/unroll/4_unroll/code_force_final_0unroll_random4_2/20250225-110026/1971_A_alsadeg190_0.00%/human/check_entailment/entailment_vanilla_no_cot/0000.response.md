Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the `if` condition and the corresponding `print` statements. The program is incorrectly printing `x, y` when `x > y`, which should actually print `y, x` (the minimum followed by the maximum). The correct logic should be:

- If `x > y`, print `y, x`.
- Otherwise, print `x, y`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This will correctly output the minimum and maximum of the two integers for each test case.
