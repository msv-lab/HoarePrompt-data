Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. There are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` for XOR Comparison**: The program uses `func_1` to compare bitwise OR operations, not XOR. The goal is to maximize the XOR operation, not the OR operation. The XOR operation is crucial to finding the maximum difference between two numbers in terms of their bit representation.

2. **Logic Flaws in Finding Maximum XOR**: The program tries to find the maximum XOR by comparing OR results, which is not the correct approach. It should compare the XOR of pairs directly, or use a strategy that indirectly helps in finding the maximum XOR by analyzing OR results in a way that can help deduce the XOR.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Equal OR Results**: The program does not handle the case where the OR results are equal correctly. It resets the list `v` and sets `mx` to the current index, but this does not guarantee that the maximum XOR will be found.

4. **Potential for Infinite Loop or Incorrect Output**: The program does not guarantee that it will always find the correct pair within the allowed number of queries (3n). The logic used might not explore all possible pairs sufficiently to ensure the maximum XOR is found.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach involving binary search on bits or using properties of XOR to reduce the number of queries is necessary. The current program does not follow the problem description accurately and might fail for various test cases where the maximum XOR is not found due to the incorrect use of OR comparisons and flawed logic.
