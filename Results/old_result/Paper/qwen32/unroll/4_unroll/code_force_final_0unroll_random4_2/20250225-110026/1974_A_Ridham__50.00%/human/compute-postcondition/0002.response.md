The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable, and `n`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will execute. The state of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `result` does not directly affect whether the loop will execute or not.

To ensure the loop executes, the variable `n` must be greater than 0. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `result` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**
