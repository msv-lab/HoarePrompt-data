Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given two pricing options:
1. Buying one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buying two yogurts for `b` burles.

The optimal strategy involves maximizing the number of two-yogurt promotions while minimizing the number of single yogurt purchases.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads multiple test cases and computes the minimum cost for each case using the following logic:
1. If `n > 1`, it calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought individually, i.e., `a * n`.
   - `ans2`: The cost if yogurts are bought in pairs with the promotion price, i.e., `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.
2. It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Function Summary

The function summary correctly states that the program computes the minimum cost for each test case using the two formulas mentioned above.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect due to the calculation of `ans2`. It suggests that the formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is flawed because it does not properly account for the number of pairs and the potential single yogurt.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic of `ans2`:

- `b * n // 2` calculates the cost for the maximum number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought using the promotion.
- `a * n % 2` calculates the cost for any remaining yogurt that cannot be paired.

This logic is correct. Here's why:
- `n // 2` gives the number of pairs.
- `n % 2` gives the number of remaining yogurts (either 0 or 1).
- The formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` ensures that the cost is computed correctly by summing the cost of all pairs and any remaining single yogurt.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the example provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Expected Output: `15` (Buy two yogurts for 11 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles)
- Program Output: `b * 3 // 2 + a * 3 % 2` = `11 * 1 + 5 * 1` = `11 + 5` = `16` (Incorrect)

However, let's re-evaluate:
- `n // 2` = `3 // 2` = `1` (number of pairs)
- `n % 2` = `3 % 2` = `1` (remaining yogurt)
- Correct calculation: `11 * 1 + 5 * 1` = `11 + 5` = `16` (This is incorrect, but let's recheck the logic)

The correct calculation should be:
- `ans1` = `a * n` = `5 * 3` = `15`
- `ans2` = `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` = `11 * 1 + 5 * 1` = `11 + 5` = `16`
- Minimum cost = `min(15, 16)` = `15`

Thus, the program is correct as it correctly calculates the minimum cost for all cases.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
