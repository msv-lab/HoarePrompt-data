The loop in the provided code is controlled by the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times based on the value of `t`. The variables `n`, `m`, and the grid of characters are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a conventional variable used to ignore the loop variable when it is not needed.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1. The state of `t` is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which means the loop will execute at least once given the problem constraints.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute since the problem guarantees that `t` is within a valid range that allows the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
