Postcondition: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks, respectively. `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited. If `visited[i]` was `False`, then `visited[i]` and any disks directly connected to `i` are now marked as `True`, `nodes` includes `i` and any disks directly connected to `i` through the DFS, and `coef0` and `coef1` are updated for disks directly connected to `i`. If `visited[i]` was already `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`.**
