You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case is represented by four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (where \( 0 \le p_i \le 200 \)) indicating the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The function receives multiple test cases, with the first line containing an integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \)) representing the number of test cases.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1

        print(cnt)
        
    #State: result1 result2 ... resultt
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a result based on these counts and prints the result. The final state of the program is the output of results for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

The program iterates through multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. It then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the following logic:

1. **Initial Check for Bob's Win:**
   - If the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd, Bob can win once initially because the XOR of three odd counts of 1, 2, and 3 will be zero.

2. **Counting Half of Each Number:**
   - For each number type (ones, twos, threes, fours), it adds the integer division of the count by 2 to the result. This is because each pair of identical numbers will cancel each other out in the XOR operation, effectively reducing the problem size by half.

### Testing the Program:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
     - Counts: `1, 1, 1, 0`
     - Initial check: `1 % 2 == 1 % 2 == 1 % 2 == 1` → True, so `cnt += 1`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) = 0`
     - Total: `1`
     - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
     - Counts: `1, 0, 1, 2`
     - Initial check: `1 % 2 == 0 % 2 == 1 % 2 == 1` → False, so `cnt += 0`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) = 1`
     - Total: `1`
     - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
     - Counts: `2, 2, 2, 0`
     - Initial check: `2 % 2 == 2 % 2 == 2 % 2 == 1` → False, so `cnt += 0`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 3`
     - Total: `3`
     - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
     - Counts: `3, 3, 2, 0`
     - Initial check: `3 % 2 == 3 % 2 == 2 % 2 == 1` → False, so `cnt += 0`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 3`
     - Total: `3`
     - Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Example:**
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
     - Counts: `0, 9, 9, 9`
     - Initial check: `0 % 2 == 9 % 2 == 9 % 2 == 1` → False, so `cnt += 0`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) = 12`
     - Total: `12`
     - Output: `12` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program seems to be correctly implementing the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case. It correctly handles the initial check for an immediate win and counts pairs of numbers that cancel each other out.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all the provided examples correctly.
