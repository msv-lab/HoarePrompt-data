You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the grid does not meet the specific conditions where all elements in the first row are the same and different from the last row, or all elements in the first column are the same and different from the last column. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

The problem asks whether it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using specific operations. The operations allow coloring all squares in a subrectangle to a specific color if the corners of the subrectangle are the same color.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (n and m) and then the grid itself.
3. It constructs two strings: `first_row` (which consists of the first character of each row) and `last_row` (which consists of the last character of each row).
4. It checks two conditions:
   - If the first row has all the same characters and the first row is different from the last row, it prints "NO".
   - If the first column (captured by `first_row`) has all the same characters and the first column is different from the last column (captured by `last_row`), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

The conditions checked in the program are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be turned into a single color. The program only checks the first and last rows and columns for uniformity and equality. However, there can be cases where the first and last rows or columns are uniform and equal, but other parts of the grid prevent making the entire grid uniform.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
BBB
BWB
BBB
```
Here, the first and last rows are the same and uniform, and the first and last columns are the same and uniform. However, the middle row has a different color in the middle, making it impossible to turn the entire grid into a single color using the allowed operations.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The conditions are too simplistic and do not consider the entire grid's configuration.
