### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down the problem and the code to understand why.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
2. A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.
3. We need to process multiple test cases.

#### Code Analysis:
1. The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` of best friends.
3. The code then contains a loop that runs `x` times (which is actually `n` times in the provided code, as `x` is not used properly and seems to be a leftover variable).
4. Inside the loop, it checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` for any `i`.
5. If this condition is met, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
6. If the loop completes without finding such an `i`, it prints `3`.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Loop Control**: The outer loop runs `n` times, but the variable `x` is not correctly utilized to control the number of test cases.
2. **Logic Error**: The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is not the correct condition to determine if sending 2 invitations will bring at least 2 friends to the party. This condition checks if `i` and `p_i` form a mutual best friendship, which is not sufficient for the problem.
3. **Output Error**: The code outputs `2` or `3` based on the above incorrect condition, which does not guarantee the minimum number of invitations required.

#### Correct Approach:
1. For each test case, construct a graph where each friend points to their best friend.
2. Identify cycles in the graph. Each cycle of length 2 or more will require at least 2 invitations to bring at least 2 friends.
3. If there are no cycles of length 2 or more, then we need to consider the smallest number of invitations to bring at least 2 friends, which might involve more complex logic than simply checking mutual best friendships.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is:

**Correctness: False**
