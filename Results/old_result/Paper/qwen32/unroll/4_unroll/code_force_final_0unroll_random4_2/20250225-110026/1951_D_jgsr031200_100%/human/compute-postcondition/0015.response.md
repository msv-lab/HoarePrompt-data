Let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is 0.
2. `k` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it does not affect the print statement).
3. `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Given that `n` is 0, this simplifies to `[-k + 1, 1]`.
4. `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n`. Since `n` is 0, this simplifies to `0 // (0 - k + 1) + 0`, which is `0 // (-k + 1) + 0`. Given that any number divided by a non-zero number and then added to zero is still zero, `h` is 0.
5. It is stated that `h` is less than `k`. Since `h` is 0, this implies that `k` must be greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. None of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h` are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
