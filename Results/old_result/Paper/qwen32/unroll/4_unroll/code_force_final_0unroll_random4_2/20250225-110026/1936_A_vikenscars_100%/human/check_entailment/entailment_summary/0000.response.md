### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized by making at most 3n queries. Let's analyze whether the provided code meets this requirement.

1. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The function `func_2` starts by finding the index of the maximum element in the permutation `p`. This is done by comparing each element `p_i` with the current maximum element (initially `p_0`) using the bitwise OR operation. This part of the code is correct and uses `n-1` queries.

2. **Finding the Optimal Pair**:
   - After finding the maximum element, the function then tries to find the second element `p_j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. This is done by comparing `p_max ⊕ p_j` with `p_max ⊕ p_pair` using the bitwise OR operation. This part of the code is also correct and uses at most `2n` queries (one for each element in the permutation).

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, the function prints the indices of the two elements that maximize the XOR operation.

### Analysis of Execution Summaries:
- The execution summary for `func_1` indicates that it correctly sends the query to the interactor and receives the response, which is accurate.
- The execution summary for `func_2` indicates that it finds the maximum element and then tries to find the optimal pair, which is also accurate.

### Total Number of Queries:
- The total number of queries made by `func_2` is at most `3n` (specifically, `n-1` for finding the maximum element and `2n` for finding the optimal pair), which satisfies the problem's constraint.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized using the allowed number of queries.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
