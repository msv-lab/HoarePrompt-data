### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all numbers in an `n x n` matrix using up to `2n` operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from `1` to `n`.

#### Strategy to Maximize the Sum:
To maximize the sum, we should aim to fill the matrix such that each cell contains the highest possible value from the permutations. The optimal strategy is to fill each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This ensures that each cell in the matrix is filled with the highest possible value, which is `n`.

#### Calculating the Maximum Sum:
Given that each cell in the matrix will be filled with `n`, the maximum sum of the matrix is `n * n * n`.

#### Operations Required:
To achieve this, we need `n` operations to fill each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` and `n` operations to fill each column with the same permutation. This totals `2n` operations.

#### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: It initializes a matrix of size `n x n` with each row filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This step is correct.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each row `i`. This formula is incorrect for the problem at hand. The correct sum should be `n * n * n`.
4. **Output**: It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (`2n`), followed by the operations themselves. The operations are correctly described as filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Correctness of the Program:
The operations described in the program are correct. However, the sum calculation is incorrect. The program should calculate the sum as `n * n * n` instead of using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

#### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation. The operations described are correct, but the sum reported is not the maximum possible sum.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it calculates the sum using an incorrect formula, even though the operations it describes are correct. The correct sum should be `n * n * n`, not the sum calculated by the given formula.
