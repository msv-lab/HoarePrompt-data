Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We have a hand of `n` cards, each with a number on it.
- We can perform operations where we choose `k` cards with the same number and exchange them for `k-1` cards with any number.
- The goal is to minimize the number of cards in the hand after performing any number of operations.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards), `k` (number of cards to exchange), and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, it directly prints `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k == n`, it prints `k - 1` because we can exchange all `k` cards for `k-1` cards.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For the general case (when `k < n`), the program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - The `func_1` function creates a frequency table of the card numbers but caps the frequency at `k`. This means it will not count more than `k` occurrences of any card number.
   - The program then checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number up to `k` times. However, capping the frequency at `k` is not sufficient to determine the correct minimum number of cards.
   - We need to consider the actual number of cards of each type and how many operations we can perform to reduce the count of each type.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Printing `k - 1`:**
   - The condition `if k in freq.values():` is not a correct way to determine if we can reduce the number of cards to `k - 1`.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the total number of cards that can be reduced through operations and then determining the minimum number of cards left.

### Correct Approach:

- For each card number, calculate the number of cards of that type.
- Determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed for each type.
- Calculate the total number of cards that can be reduced.
- The remaining number of cards is the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the logic in `func_1` and the incorrect condition for printing `k - 1`, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
