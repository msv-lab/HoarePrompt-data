Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. Let's analyze the logic in the program:

- If `b == c` (i.e., `n == m`), it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
- If `b < c` (i.e., `n < m`), it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, it is impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `b % 2 == c % 2` (i.e., `n % 2 == m % 2`), it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if both `n` and `m` are either even or odd, it is possible to reach exactly `m` cubes with `n` moves. This is because the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between `n` and `m` dictates the possibility of reaching `m` cubes. If the difference is even, it means the number of additions and subtractions can balance out to reach `m`.
- Otherwise, it prints 'No'. This is correct for the same reason as above, if the difference is odd, it is impossible to balance the additions and subtractions to reach `m` cubes.

Given these conditions, the program correctly handles all possible scenarios as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
