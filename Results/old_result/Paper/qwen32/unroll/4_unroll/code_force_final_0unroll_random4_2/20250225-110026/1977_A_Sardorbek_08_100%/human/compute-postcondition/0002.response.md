Let's analyze the loop to understand the output state after it executes all iterations. The loop processes `a` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. The loop logic is as follows:

1. If `n` is equal to `m`, it prints 'YES'.
2. If `n` is less than `m`, it prints 'NO'.
3. If `n` is greater than `m` and `n % 2` is equal to `m % 2`, it prints 'Yes'.
4. If `n` is greater than `m` and `n % 2` is not equal to `m % 2`, it prints 'No'.

The loop does not modify any variables outside of its local scope (`b`, `c`, `q`), and it does not maintain any cumulative state. Each iteration of the loop is independent and only affects the output (print statements).

Given this, the output state after the loop finishes will be a series of print statements, one for each test case, based on the conditions mentioned above. The variables `a`, `n`, and `m` from the initial state will remain unchanged in the sense that they are not modified by the loop.

Output State: **a series of print statements ('YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No') corresponding to each test case, with variables `a`, `n`, and `m` unchanged in their initial state representation.**
