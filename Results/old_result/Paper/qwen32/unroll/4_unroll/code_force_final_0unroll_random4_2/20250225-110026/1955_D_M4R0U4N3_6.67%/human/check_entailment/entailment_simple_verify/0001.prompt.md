You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to count the number of subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subarrays. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the array `a` and the array `b`.
   - `todo` is initialized as a set of elements in `b` that need to be matched.
   - `done` is initialized as a set that will hold elements from the current window that match elements in `b`.
   - `extra` is initialized as a set that will hold elements from the current window that do not match elements in `b`.

2. **First Window**:
   - The program processes the first window of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each element in the first window, it checks if the element is in `todo`.
     - If it is, it moves the element from `todo` to `done`.
     - If it is not, it adds the element to `extra`.
   - It checks if the size of `done` is at least `k` and sets the initial answer `ans` accordingly.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program slides the window across the rest of `a` from position `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new position `r`:
     - It removes the element that is sliding out of the window (`old = a[r - m]`).
       - If `old` is in `extra`, it removes it from `extra`.
       - If `old` is in `done`, it removes it from `done` and adds it back to `todo`.
     - It adds the new element (`a[r]`) to the window.
       - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it moves it from `todo` to `done`.
       - If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it adds it to `extra`.
     - It checks if the size of `done` is at least `k` and updates `ans` if it is.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows, the program prints the count of good subarrays for the current test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly uses a sliding window to efficiently count the number of subarrays that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of `b`. It maintains the correct state of elements in the current window using sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra`. The logic for adding and removing elements from these sets is correct, ensuring that the program accurately counts the number of good subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
