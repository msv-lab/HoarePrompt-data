Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes the number of cows `n` and an integer `k`, along with a list of unique ratings for the cows. It determines and returns an index based on the ratings relative to the rating at index `k-1` in the first test case. The return value is one of several possible indices or values derived from the conditions specified in the test case.**
