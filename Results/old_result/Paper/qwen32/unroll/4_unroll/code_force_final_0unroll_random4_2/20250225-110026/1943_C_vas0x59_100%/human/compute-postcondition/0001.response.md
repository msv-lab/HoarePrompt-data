The code snippet provided initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. This means that each vertex `u` (from 0 to `n-1`) will have an associated empty list in `u2vs` which will be used to store the vertices directly connected to `u`.

Since `u2vs` was previously described as a list of lists where `u2vs[u]` contains the list of vertices directly connected to vertex `u`, the code now ensures that `u2vs` is initialized with `n` empty lists, one for each vertex.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user; `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**
