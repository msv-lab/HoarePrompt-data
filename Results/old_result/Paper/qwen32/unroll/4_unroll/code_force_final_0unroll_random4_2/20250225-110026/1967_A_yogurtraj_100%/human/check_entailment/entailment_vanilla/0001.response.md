Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. To achieve this, we can buy up to `k` additional cards. 

### Solution Explanation

The solution provided attempts to determine the maximum number of cards of each type that we can have in a permutation by first sorting the list of card counts (`a`). It then tries to equalize the counts by buying additional cards, starting from the smallest count and moving upwards. 

Let's break down the key parts of the code:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` (number of distinct types of cards) and `k` (number of coins).
   - It then reads the list of card counts `a`.

2. **Sorting the Card Counts**
   - The list `a` is sorted. This is done to facilitate the process of equalizing the counts starting from the smallest.

3. **Equalizing Counts**
   - The code iterates through the sorted list and tries to equalize the counts by buying cards.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if it's possible to make all counts up to `i` equal to `a[i + 1]` by spending `k` coins.
   - If it's possible, it updates the remaining coins `k` and the count `r` that we can achieve.
   - If it's not possible to make all counts up to `i` equal to `a[i + 1]`, it calculates how many cards of each type we can have by spending the remaining coins `k`.

4. **Calculating the Result**
   - If there are remaining coins after the loop, it updates the count `r` and calculates the result.
   - If there are no remaining coins, it calculates the result based on the count `r` and the remaining counts that couldn't be equalized.

### Issues with the Solution

The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

- **Incorrect Calculation of the Result**: The formula used to calculate the result is incorrect. The formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` does not correctly account for the number of permutations of length `n` that can be formed.
- **Handling of Remaining Coins**: The way remaining coins are handled is incorrect. The solution does not correctly distribute the remaining coins to maximize the number of permutations.
- **Equalization Logic**: The logic for equalizing the counts is not optimal. The solution does not ensure that the counts are equalized in a way that maximizes the number of permutations.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the solution, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
