You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: The output state consists of `t` integers, each representing the result `ans` for the corresponding test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements from list `b`. It then prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the elements in array `b` are not unique. Specifically, the use of sets (`todo`, `done`, `extra`) does not account for the multiplicity of elements in `b`. This can lead to incorrect counts of matching elements in the subsegments of `a`.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 2 1 1
1 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- Subsegment [1, 2, 2] matches [1, 2, 2] (all elements match, so it's good).
- Subsegment [2, 2, 1] matches [1, 2, 2] (two elements match, so it's good).
- Subsegment [2, 1, 1] does not match [1, 2, 2] (only one element matches, so it's not good).
- Subsegment [1, 1, 1] does not match [1, 2, 2] (only one element matches, so it's not good).

However, the program will incorrectly identify the third subsegment as good because it only checks for the presence of elements in sets, not their counts.

To fix this, the program should use `Counter` from the `collections` module to keep track of the counts of elements in `b` and the current subsegment of `a`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b_counter = Counter(b)
        current_counter = Counter(a[:m])
        matches = sum((current_counter & b_counter).values())
        ans = 1 if matches >= k else 0
        for r in range(m, n):
            old = a[r - m]
            new = a[r]
            current_counter[old] -= 1
            if current_counter[old] == 0:
                del current_counter[old]
            current_counter[new] += 1
            matches = sum((current_counter & b_counter).values())
            if matches >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version uses `Counter` to accurately track the counts of elements in `b` and the current subsegment of `a`, ensuring that the number of matching elements is correctly calculated.
