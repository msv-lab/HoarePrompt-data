The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. 

Given the problem description, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, which means `int(input())` will be `t` and it will always be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute based on the loop head alone.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
