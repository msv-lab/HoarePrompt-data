To determine the output state after the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the `func_1` function. However, since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we must make an assumption about its behavior based on the context.

Given the loop's structure and the comparison with `<`, it's reasonable to assume that `func_1(a, b, c, d)` returns a comparison result between the elements at indices `a` and `c` (or `b` and `d`) in the permutation `p`. Since `max_item_idx` is updated when `ans` is `'<'`, it suggests that `func_1` returns `'<'` if the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `max_item_idx`.

With this assumption, the loop iterates over each index from 1 to `n-1` and updates `max_item_idx` to the index of the largest element encountered so far. After the loop completes, `max_item_idx` will point to the index of the maximum element in the permutation `p`.

Given the initial state where `max_item_idx` is 0, the loop will check each element against the current maximum and update `max_item_idx` accordingly.

Output State: **max_item_idx is the index of the maximum element in the permutation p.**
