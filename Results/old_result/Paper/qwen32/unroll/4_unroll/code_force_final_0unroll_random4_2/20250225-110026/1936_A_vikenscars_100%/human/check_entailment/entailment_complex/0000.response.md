### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding two indices `i` and `j` such that the XOR of the corresponding elements in a secret permutation `p` is maximized. The solution provided uses an interactive approach where it can ask queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

Let's break down the provided solution:

1. **Finding the Maximum Element in the Permutation:**
   - The first loop in `func_2` iterates through the permutation to find the index of the maximum element. This is done by comparing the bitwise OR of the current maximum element with each element in the permutation. If the bitwise OR of the current element is greater, the index of the current element is updated as the new maximum.
   - This loop ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the maximum element in the permutation.

2. **Finding the Pair with the Maximum XOR:**
   - The second loop in `func_2` aims to find a pair of indices `(max_item_idx, pair_idx)` such that the XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized.
   - For each element in the permutation, it compares the bitwise OR of the maximum element with the current element (`max_item_idx, i`) and the bitwise OR of the current pair (`pair_idx, i`).
   - If the bitwise OR of `(max_item_idx, i)` is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
   - If the bitwise OR of `(max_item_idx, i)` is equal to the bitwise OR of `(pair_idx, i)`, it performs an additional comparison to determine if `i` should be the new `pair_idx`. This is done by comparing the bitwise OR of `(pair_idx, pair_idx)` with `(i, i)`. If the bitwise OR of `(pair_idx, pair_idx)` is greater, `pair_idx` remains unchanged; otherwise, it is updated to `i`.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loops, the solution outputs the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` as the pair with the maximum XOR.

### Analysis:

- **Maximizing XOR:**
  - The XOR operation between two numbers is maximized when the numbers differ as much as possible in their binary representations. The maximum possible XOR for a permutation of `0` to `n-1` is `n-1 XOR 0` or `n-2 XOR 1`, which is `n-1` (if `n` is a power of 2) or slightly less.
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation and then finds a pair that maximizes the XOR by comparing bitwise ORs.

- **Query Limit:**
  - The algorithm makes at most `2n` queries in the worst case (one loop with `n-1` queries and another loop with `n` queries), which is well within the limit of `3n` queries.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly identifies a pair of indices such that the XOR of the corresponding elements in the permutation is maximized, and it does so within the allowed number of queries.

**Correctness: True**
