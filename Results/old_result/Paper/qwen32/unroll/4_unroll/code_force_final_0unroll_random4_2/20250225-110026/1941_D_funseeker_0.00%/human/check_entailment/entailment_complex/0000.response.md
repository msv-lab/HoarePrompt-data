### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1()` reads a single line of input and strips it of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and converts the result to an integer, which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, and converts each substring to an integer, returning the resulting list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4()` is called for each test case.
   - For each test case, `func_4()` starts by reading three integers: `n` (number of players), `m` (number of throws), and `x` (initial player with the ball).
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to a temporary set `temp` for each `q` in `ans`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to `temp` for each `q` in `ans`.
   - After processing each throw, it updates `ans` to be the temporary set `temp`.
   - After all throws, it checks if `0` is in `ans` and replaces it with `n` if it is.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of players in the final set `ans`.
   - It then prints the players in increasing order.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Initialization:** The initial player `x` is correctly added to the set `ans`.
- **Throw Processing:** For each throw, the function correctly computes the new positions of the ball considering both possible directions ('0', '1', '?') and updates the set `ans` accordingly.
- **Modulo Operation:** The modulo operation `% n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly within the circle.
- **Handling `0`:** The function correctly replaces `0` with `n` if `0` is present in the final set `ans`, ensuring that the player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.
- **Final Output:** The function prints the number of possible final players and their numbers in increasing order.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles all edge cases, such as the possible directions of each throw and the modulo operation to wrap around the circle. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
