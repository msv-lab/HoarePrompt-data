### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that the prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). The provided solution iterates through both strings using two pointers: `i` for string \( a \) and `j` for string \( b \). The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 to start from the beginning of strings \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - `c` is initialized to 0 to count the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of \( a \) and `j` is less than the length of \( b \).
   - Inside the loop, `func_1` is called to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not -1), it means `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]` at the returned index. The pointers `i` and `j` are updated accordingly, and `c` is incremented by 1.
   - If `func_1` returns -1, it means `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, and the loop breaks.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` using the `find` method.
   - If the character is found, it returns the sum of `j` and the index where `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]`.
   - If the character is not found, it returns -1.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the value of `c` is printed, which represents the maximum length \( k \) of the prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the solution with the first example provided:

**Input:**
```
5 4
10011
1110
```

**Execution:**
- `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `c = 0`
- `func_1(a, b, 0, 0)` finds '1' at index 0 in `b[0:]`, so `j = 1`, `i = 1`, `c = 1`
- `func_1(a, b, 1, 1)` finds '0' at index 2 in `b[1:]`, so `j = 3`, `i = 2`, `c = 2`
- `func_1(a, b, 2, 3)` does not find '0' in `b[3:]`, so the loop breaks.
- Output: `c = 2`

The solution correctly finds that the maximum \( k \) is 2, matching the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly solves the problem by iterating through the strings and using a helper function to find the next occurrence of characters. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
