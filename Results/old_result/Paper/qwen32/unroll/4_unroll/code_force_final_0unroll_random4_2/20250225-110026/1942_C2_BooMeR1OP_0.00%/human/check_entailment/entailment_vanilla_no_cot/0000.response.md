Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This assumes that the `x` vertices already form a structure that can produce `x - 2` triangles, which is not necessarily true. The vertices chosen by Bessie may not form a connected structure that can produce any triangles initially.

2. **Checking for adjacent vertices:** The program checks if the next vertex in the sorted list of chosen vertices is adjacent to the current vertex. However, this logic does not correctly account for the possibility of forming triangles with additional vertices. The check for `t1` and `t2` does not consider the gaps between vertices and how additional vertices can fill those gaps to form triangles.

3. **Gap calculation and triangle formation:** The program calculates gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and tries to fill these gaps with additional vertices to form triangles. However, the logic for filling gaps and counting triangles is flawed. Specifically, the formula `ans += gap` when `y >= pairs` is incorrect. The number of triangles that can be formed is not equal to the gap size. Instead, it should be based on the number of pairs of vertices that can be formed within the gap.

4. **Handling of additional vertices:** The program does not correctly handle the addition of vertices to form the maximum number of triangles. The logic for reducing `y` and adding to `ans` does not account for the correct number of triangles that can be formed with the additional vertices.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed to consider how additional vertices can be strategically placed to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles. This involves a more detailed analysis of the gaps between chosen vertices and how additional vertices can fill those gaps optimally.
