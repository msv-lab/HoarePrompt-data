Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interact with the interactor by making queries in the form "? a b c d" (where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) and receiving a response of "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The function must find a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized and print "! i j" for each test case. The total number of queries across all test cases must not exceed 3n, where n is the sum of lengths of all permutations.**
