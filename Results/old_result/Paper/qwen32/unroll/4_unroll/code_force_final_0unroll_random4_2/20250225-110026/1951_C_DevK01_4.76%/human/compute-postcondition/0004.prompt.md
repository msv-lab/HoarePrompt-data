You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Following these integers, there is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The number of test cases t is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: A series of integers, each representing the cost calculated for a respective test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, the function performs some computation and returns a result based on the provided values. The integer `n` represents the number of elements in the list, `m` is another integer, and `k` is a third integer that is constrained to be no greater than the minimum of `nm` and 1,000,000,000. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with the total number of elements `n` across all test cases not exceeding 300,000.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
