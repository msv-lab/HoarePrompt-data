Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer in `p` is between 1 and `n`, and no integer in `p` is equal to its index (1-based). The function returns the number of cycles in the permutation defined by the list `p` for each test case.**
