Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips such that they form a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. 

The current implementation does the following:
1. It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list of cells.
2. It counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list and outputs this count.

However, the number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block is not necessarily the number of zeros in the trimmed list. Instead, it should be calculated based on the distances each chip needs to move to be adjacent to its closest neighbors.

Here's a correct approach:
1. Identify the positions of all the chips.
2. Calculate the cost of moving each chip to the leftmost possible position in the contiguous block.
3. Sum these costs to get the total number of operations.

The provided program does not perform these steps and thus does not yield the correct answer for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
