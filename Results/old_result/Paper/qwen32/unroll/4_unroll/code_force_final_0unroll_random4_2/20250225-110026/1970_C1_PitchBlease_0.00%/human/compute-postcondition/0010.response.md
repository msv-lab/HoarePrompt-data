Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed). The tree has exactly two leaves. The function returns 'Ron' in Case_1 and 'Hermione' in Case_2.**
