### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. The program checks specific conditions about the first and last rows but does not comprehensively evaluate the entire grid.

The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks:
1. If all characters in the first row are the same and the first row is not equal to the last row.
2. If all characters in the `first_row` (which is a string composed of the first characters of each row) are the same and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

These checks are insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color. A more comprehensive approach is needed.

The original assessment provides a counterexample:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
This grid should print "NO" because it is impossible to make all squares the same color using the described operations. The provided program would incorrectly print "YES" for this grid.

The correct approach, as mentioned in the original assessment, is to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If both 'W' and 'B' are present, it is impossible to make all squares the same color. If only one of them is present, then it is possible.

The corrected version of the program provided in the original assessment correctly implements this logic:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        has_W = any('W' in row for row in grid)
        has_B = any('B' in row for row in grid)
        if has_W and has_B:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of both 'W' and 'B' in the grid and prints "NO" if both are present, otherwise it prints "YES". This approach is correct and ensures that the program accurately determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
