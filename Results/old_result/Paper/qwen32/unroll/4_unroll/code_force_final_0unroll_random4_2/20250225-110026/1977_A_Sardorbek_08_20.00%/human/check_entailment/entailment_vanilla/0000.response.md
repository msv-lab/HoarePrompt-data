Let's examine the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower per move. The task is to determine if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**: Nikita can either add or remove 1 cube per move.
3. **Parity**: Since each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either +1 or -1), the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes will change with each move.
4. **Final State**: After `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` must be reachable. This means:
   - If `n` is even, `m` must be even (since starting from 0, an even number of moves will result in an even number of cubes).
   - If `n` is odd, `m` must be odd (since starting from 0, an odd number of moves will result in an odd number of cubes).
5. **Range**: The number of cubes `m` cannot exceed `n` (since you can't have more cubes than the number of moves if you start from 0).

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - The first condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves `n` equals the number of cubes `m`. This is not necessarily a correct condition for determining the possibility of having `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The second condition `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`. This is correct because you cannot have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The third condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. It seems to be checking the parity of the number of test cases `a` and the number of moves `b`, which is irrelevant. It should be checking the parity of `n` and `m`.
   - The last condition `else:` handles all other cases, but itâ€™s not correctly structured due to the incorrect third condition.

### Correct Conditions:
- If `n` is less than `m`, print "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), print "YES".
- Otherwise, print "NO".

### Corrected Logic:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program has incorrect logic in the third condition and does not correctly handle the parity check between `n` and `m`. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
