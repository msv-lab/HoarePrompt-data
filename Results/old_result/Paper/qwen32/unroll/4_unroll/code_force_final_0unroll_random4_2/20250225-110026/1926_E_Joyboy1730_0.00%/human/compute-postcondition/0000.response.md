The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other conditions related to `n` and `k` for each test case remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.**
