### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided solution using the annotations and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing a series of operations, where each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The maximum possible sum can be achieved by ensuring that the highest numbers appear as frequently as possible in the matrix.

#### Maximum Sum Calculation:
The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix can be derived from the formula:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \]

This formula ensures that each number \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) contributes optimally to the sum.

#### Operation Strategy:
The provided solution suggests filling the rows and columns in reverse order using permutations that place higher numbers in more positions. Specifically, it performs two operations for each row and column:
1. A Type 1 operation (filling a row).
2. A Type 2 operation (filling a column).

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   The sum is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
   \]
   Simplifying the term inside the summation:
   \[
   i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
   \]
   Therefore, the sum becomes:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} 2i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
   \]
   Which further simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
   \]
   Using the formula for the sum of squares and the sum of integers:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
   \]
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\right)
   \]
   Simplifying this expression correctly yields:
   \[
   \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2
   \]

2. **Operations:**
   The provided operations involve filling each row and column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]. However, this strategy does not necessarily maximize the sum. The operations should be designed to ensure that higher numbers appear in more positions, but the current strategy does not guarantee this.

   For example, in the case where \( n = 2 \):
   - The optimal matrix would be:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     2 & 1 \\
     1 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The provided solution would produce:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The optimal sum is 7, but the provided solution would yield a sum of 6.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution incorrectly calculates the sum and does not guarantee the maximum sum for all cases. The operations do not ensure that higher numbers appear in the optimal positions.

### Final: **False**
