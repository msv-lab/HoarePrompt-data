Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string is flawed.

Let's analyze the provided code and identify the issues:

1. **Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The code attempts to construct the smallest string by choosing the smaller value between the two cells at each step, but it does not correctly handle the transitions between rows (from row 1 to row 2 or vice versa).
   - The code does not correctly account for the possibility of switching rows to achieve a smaller string.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The count of paths yielding the smallest string is incorrect because it only considers a very specific pattern of switching rows, which might not cover all possible paths that yield the smallest string.

Here is a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
0111
1000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0000
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The lexicographically smallest string is `0000`, which can be achieved by the following paths:
  1. Path: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4)
  2. Path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0100
1
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The program constructs the string `0100` by choosing the smaller value at each step without correctly considering the possibility of switching rows to get a smaller string.
- The count of paths is `1` because the program does not account for the second path that yields `0000`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases and does not produce the correct output for the given test case.
