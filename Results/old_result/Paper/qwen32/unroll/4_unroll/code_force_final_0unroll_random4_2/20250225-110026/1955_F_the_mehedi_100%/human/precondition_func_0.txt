Each test case is represented by four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (where \( 0 \le p_i \le 200 \)) indicating the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The function receives multiple test cases, with the first line containing an integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \)) representing the number of test cases.
