Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints a value based on the specified operations involving the array and the parameters `k` and `x`. Specifically, it computes a modified sum of the array elements after applying certain reductions and additions as defined in the code.**
