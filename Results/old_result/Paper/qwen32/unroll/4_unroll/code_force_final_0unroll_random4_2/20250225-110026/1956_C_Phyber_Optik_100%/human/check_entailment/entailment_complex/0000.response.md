### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
Nene wants to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix filled with zeros. She can perform two types of operations:
1. Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Assign a permutation to a column.

The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements using no more than 2n operations.

#### Observations:
- The maximum sum can be achieved by ensuring each unique number from 1 to n appears in each row and each column exactly once. This is because the sum of the first n natural numbers is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), and by placing each number optimally in the matrix, we can achieve the maximum possible sum.
- The maximum sum for an n x n matrix is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \times n = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\).

#### Program Analysis:
- The program calculates the sum as `1 + (2^2 - 1^2) * 2 + (3^2 - 2^2) * 3 + ... + (n^2 - (n-1)^2) * n`. This simplifies to \(\frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\), which is the correct maximum sum for the matrix.
- The program then prints this sum along with `2n` as the number of operations.
- The operations themselves are described as filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` in a specific order.

#### Validity of Operations:
- The program performs `n` Type 1 operations (filling each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`) and `n` Type 2 operations (filling each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`).
- This results in a total of `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
- Since each row and each column ends up being filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, the matrix will contain each number from 1 to n exactly once in each row and each column, achieving the maximum possible sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum using no more than `2n` operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
