### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

To satisfy \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ dx + dy = d(x + y) \text{ is a multiple of } d \cdot y = dy \]
This simplifies to:
\[ x + y \text{ is a multiple of } y \]
This implies:
\[ x = ky \text{ for some integer } k \]
Since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the only possible value for \(k\) is 1, meaning \(x = 1\). Therefore, \(a = d \cdot 1 = d\) and \(b = d \cdot y\).

The number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is determined by counting all possible values of \(d\) and \(y\) such that \(a \le n\) and \(b \le m\). Specifically, for each \(d\), the number of valid \(y\) values is the number of integers \(y\) such that \(d \le n\) and \(dy \le m\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`. Inside `func_1()`, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)), initializes `ans` to \(n\), and then iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\), updating `ans` based on a formula that doesn't align with the problem's requirements.

The key part of the program is:
```python
ans = n
root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
for i in range(2, root + 1):
    cnt = i * i
    ans += (n + i) // cnt
print(ans)
```

This logic does not match the problem's requirements. It seems to be counting something related to divisors of \(n\) but does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotations provided do not match the logic of the problem. They describe a process that iterates through divisors of \(n\) and updates `ans` based on a specific formula, but this formula does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given problem constraints. It appears to be solving a different problem or using a different approach that is not applicable here.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given problem constraints.
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
