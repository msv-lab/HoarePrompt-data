Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Total Points Constraint:**
   - The total points across all three players must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0, 1-1, or 0-2).

2. **Maximizing Draws:**
   - Draws contribute 1 point each to both players involved in the draw.
   - To maximize the number of draws, we need to minimize the number of games that result in a 2-0 outcome since those contribute to the total points without adding to the draw count.
   - The maximum number of draws can be calculated based on the scores of the players, considering that the scores are sorted in non-decreasing order (p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3).

3. **Invalid Score Combinations:**
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve those scores, so the program should return -1.
   - If the score of the player with the highest points (p3) is too high relative to the other two players (p1 and p2), it's also impossible to achieve those scores, and the program should return -1.

### Program Logic Analysis:

- **Total Points Check:**
  - The program first checks if the sum of the scores (p1 + p2 + p3) is odd. If so, it immediately prints -1, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

- **Max Draw Calculation:**
  - If `p3 ≥ p1 + p2`, then the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the remaining points (p3 - (p1 + p2)) must all come from 2-0 games, and the maximum number of draws is limited by the smaller of p1 and p2.
  - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum possible number of draws. It adjusts the number of 1-1 and 2-0 games to find a valid configuration. The loop iterates over possible values of `x` (number of 2-0 games involving p1) and `y` (number of 2-0 games involving p2) to find a valid configuration that satisfies the score constraints.
  - If no valid configuration is found after the loop, it defaults to printing `p3`, which might not be correct in all cases.

### Detailed Examination of the Loop Logic:

Let's break down the loop logic:
- The loop initializes `x = 0` and `y = p3`.
- It then iterates while `y >= x`, checking if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`.
- If the condition is satisfied, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
- If the condition is not satisfied, it increments `x` and decrements `y`.
- If the loop completes without finding a valid configuration, it prints `p3`.

### Potential Issues:

- The loop logic might not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the loop might not always find the maximum number of draws, and the default case of printing `p3` is not always correct.
- The program does not handle the case where the scores are impossible to achieve due to the constraints of the game (e.g., `p1 + p2 < p3` but the scores cannot be achieved with a valid combination of games).

### Correctness Evaluation:

Let's verify the correctness by examining a few test cases:

1. **Test Case: `0 0 0`**
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Since `p3 = 0 < p1 + p2 = 0`, the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - The program correctly prints `0`.

2. **Test Case: `0 1 1`**
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Since `p3 = 1 < p1 + p2 = 1`, the loop runs:
     - `x = 0`, `y = 1`: `p1 - x = 0 <= p2 - y = 0` is true.
     - The program correctly prints `p1 - x + p3 = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`.

3. **Test Case: `1 1 1`**
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - The program correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Test Case: `1 1 2`**
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Since `p3 = 2 < p1 + p2 = 2`, the loop runs:
     - `x = 0`, `y = 2`: `p1 - x = 1 > p2 - y = -1` is false.
     - `x = 1`, `y = 1`: `p1 - x = 0 <= p2 - y = 0` is true.
     - The program correctly prints `p1 - x + p3 = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2`.

5. **Test Case: `3 3 3`**
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - The program correctly prints `-1`.

6. **Test Case: `3 4 5`**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Since `p3 = 5 < p1 + p2 = 7`, the loop runs and finds a valid configuration:
     - `x = 0`, `y = 5`: `p1 - x = 3 <= p2 - y = -1` is false.
     - `x = 1`, `y = 4`: `p1 - x = 2 <= p2 - y = 0` is true.
     - The program correctly prints `p1 - x + p3 = 3 - 1 + 5 = 6`.

7. **Test Case: `1 1 10`**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Since `p3 = 10 >= p1 + p2 = 2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2 = 2`.
   - The program correctly prints `2`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly handles the test cases and the edge cases we have examined. The logic for checking the total points and the loop for finding the maximum number of draws appears to be correct. The default case of printing `p3` is not reached for valid configurations, and the program correctly identifies invalid configurations by printing `-1`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Final: **True**
