The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the grid does not meet the specific conditions where all elements in the first row are the same and different from the last row, or all elements in the first column are the same and different from the last column. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
