In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range function with `int(input())`. Therefore, only the state of `t` can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 because the range function will generate numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `t`. If `t` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
