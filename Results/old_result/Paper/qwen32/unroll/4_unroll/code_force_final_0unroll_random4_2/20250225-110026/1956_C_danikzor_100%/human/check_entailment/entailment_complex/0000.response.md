### Reasoning:
The provided program is supposed to solve the problem by maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The program reads multiple test cases, calculates the maximum sum, and outputs the operations needed to achieve this sum.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is used to compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix. This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, and it represents the maximum sum achievable by filling the matrix optimally.
   - For a matrix where each row and column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \), the maximum sum can be calculated using this formula.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations: \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - Each Type 1 operation fills a row with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).
   - Each Type 2 operation fills a column with the same permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \).

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then outputs the operations themselves, specifying the type of operation, the row or column index, and the permutation.

### Verification:
- The formula for the maximum sum is correct and matches the problem's requirements.
- The operations described ensure that each row and column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \), which is optimal for maximizing the sum.
- The number of operations is exactly \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
