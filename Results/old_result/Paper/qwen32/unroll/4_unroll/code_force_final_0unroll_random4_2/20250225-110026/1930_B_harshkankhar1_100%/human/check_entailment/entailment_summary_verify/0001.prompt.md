You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, creates a list of integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the transformed list. This process is repeated for `t` test cases, where `t` is specified before the function call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1].

### Program Analysis

The given program does the following:

1. It reads the number of test cases t.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
3. Inside `func_1()`, it:
   - Creates a list `a` of integers from 1 to n.
   - Reverses the even-indexed elements of `a`.
   - Prints the modified list `a`.

Let's see if this approach satisfies the problem's requirements.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the example given in the problem:

#### Test Case 1: n = 4

- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- After reversing the even-indexed elements: `[4, 2, 1, 3]`

Now let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- p[1] = 4, p[2] = 2, p[3] = 1, p[4] = 3
- There are no pairs (i, j) such that p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1].

#### Test Case 2: n = 3

- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3]`
- After reversing the even-indexed elements: `[1, 2, 3]` (no change as there's only one even index, which is 2, and it is the same in the reversed list)

Now let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- p[1] = 1, p[2] = 2, p[3] = 3
- There are no pairs (i, j) such that p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1].

### General Case

The provided program reverses the even-indexed elements of the list. This means that the even-indexed elements (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) are placed in reverse order while the odd-indexed elements (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) remain in their original order.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **Odd-Indexed Elements (1, 3, 5, ...)**: These elements remain in their original order. Since they are in increasing order, no two elements can satisfy the condition p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1] because i and j are odd and i+1 and j+1 are even, making the condition impossible to satisfy with these elements.

2. **Even-Indexed Elements (2, 4, 6, ...)**: These elements are in decreasing order. Any two even-indexed elements p[i] and p[j] will not satisfy the condition p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1] because i and j are even and i+1 and j+1 are odd, making the condition impossible to satisfy with these elements.

3. **Cross-Indexed Elements (odd and even)**: The only possible scenario is when i is odd and j is even (or vice versa). In this case, p[i] and p[j] cannot satisfy the condition p[i] divides p[j] and p[i+1] divides p[j+1] because p[i+1] and p[j+1] will be of opposite parity (one even and one odd), making the condition impossible to satisfy.

### Conclusion

The provided program generates a permutation that satisfies the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
