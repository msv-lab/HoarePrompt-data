You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` as input. It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + sum(min(a[j], b[j]) for j from i+1 to n-1)` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
Kirill wants to move up in a queue of `n` people to be among the first `m` people. For each person `i` in the queue, Kirill can bribe them directly to move up to position `i` by paying `a[i]` coins. Additionally, for each person `k` between `j` and `i` (where `j < k < i`), Kirill has to pay `b[k]` coins. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the input for multiple test cases. For each test case, it defines the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable position `m`. It also reads two lists, `a` and `b`, which represent the costs for bribing people directly and the costs for bribing people indirectly, respectively.

The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions. Here's how the function works:

1. **Cost Calculation (`c` list):** The function creates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This list represents the minimum cost to "remove" the `i-th` person from the queue if Kirill were to move up to position `i`.

2. **Suffix Sum Calculation (`suff` list):** The function calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to the end of the list. This helps in quickly calculating the total cost of removing all people from position `i+1` to the end of the queue.

3. **Minimum Cost Calculation:** The function initializes `ans` to infinity and then iterates over the first `m` positions (since Kirill wants to be among the first `m` people). For each position `i`, it calculates the cost of moving to that position as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updates `ans` with the minimum cost found.

4. **Output:** Finally, the function prints the minimum cost calculated.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Misinterpretation of `b` Costs:** The program assumes that `c[i]` (the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`) is the cost to remove the `i-th` person from the queue. However, the problem specifies that `b[i]` is the cost to pay to people between `j` and `i` when bribing person `j` to move up to position `i`. This means the `c` list as defined in the program does not correctly represent the cost to move up to position `i`.
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** The program incorrectly calculates the cost to move up to position `i` by simply adding `a[i]` and the suffix sum from `i+1` to the end. This does not account for the `b` costs correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it misinterprets the costs and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move up to one of the first `m` positions.
