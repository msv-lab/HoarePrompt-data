Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to count the number of subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subarrays. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the array `a` and the array `b`.
   - `todo` is initialized as a set of elements in `b` that need to be matched.
   - `done` is initialized as a set that will hold elements from the current window that match elements in `b`.
   - `extra` is initialized as a set that will hold elements from the current window that do not match elements in `b`.

2. **First Window**:
   - The program processes the first window of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each element in the first window, it checks if the element is in `todo`.
     - If it is, it moves the element from `todo` to `done`.
     - If it is not, it adds the element to `extra`.
   - It checks if the size of `done` is at least `k` and sets the initial answer `ans` accordingly.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program slides the window across the rest of `a` from position `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new position `r`:
     - It removes the element that is sliding out of the window (`old = a[r - m]`).
       - If `old` is in `extra`, it removes it from `extra`.
       - If `old` is in `done`, it removes it from `done` and adds it back to `todo`.
     - It adds the new element (`a[r]`) to the window.
       - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it moves it from `todo` to `done`.
       - If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it adds it to `extra`.
     - It checks if the size of `done` is at least `k` and updates `ans` if it is.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows, the program prints the count of good subarrays for the current test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly uses a sliding window to efficiently count the number of subarrays that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of `b`. It maintains the correct state of elements in the current window using sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra`. The logic for adding and removing elements from these sets is correct, ensuring that the program accurately counts the number of good subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
