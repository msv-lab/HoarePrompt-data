### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The logic is based on the total points and the constraints provided by the scores.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players respectively.

2. **Odd Total Points Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points from games (where each game contributes either 0, 1, or 2 points) cannot be odd.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the maximum number of draws can happen if `p3` is the sum of `p1` and `p2`, implying that `p3` could have won all games against `p1` and `p2` and drawn all games between them.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program calculates the possible number of draws in a more complex manner:
     - It calculates `low` and `high` values which represent the minimum and maximum possible differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`.
     - It then iterates to find a valid configuration where the points can be distributed among the players such that the conditions are satisfied.
     - If a valid configuration is found, it prints the maximum number of draws; otherwise, it defaults to printing `p3`.

Let's verify the correctness of the program based on the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `0 0 0` - No games were played, so the output is `0` (correct).
- **Example 2**: `0 1 1` - One draw between the second and third player, so the output is `1` (correct).
- **Example 3**: `1 1 1` - This is impossible because the total points are odd, so the output is `-1` (correct).
- **Example 4**: `1 1 2` - Two draws between the players, so the output is `2` (correct).
- **Example 5**: `3 3 3` - This is impossible because the total points are odd, so the output is `-1` (correct).
- **Example 6**: `3 4 5` - Six draws between the players, so the output is `6` (correct).
- **Example 7**: `1 1 10` - Two draws between the players, so the output is `2` (correct).

The program handles all these edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided test cases and logic.

### Correctness: **True**
