Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a value based on the conditions specified for each test case. If none of the specified conditions are met, it implicitly returns a default value or handles the case as defined in the function.**
