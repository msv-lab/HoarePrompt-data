Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; each of the `q` queries is a pair of integers (l, r) such that 1 <= l < r <= n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1 plus twice the total number of test cases plus the sum of `n` for all test cases; `results` is a list of strings 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to the answers of the queries for all test cases.`**
