Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= p_i <= n; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= s_i <= n; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input; additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`; at least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is less than or equal to 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`; `ans` is the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`; `cur` is `M1 - 2`. Additionally, `M1` is greater than 1.**
