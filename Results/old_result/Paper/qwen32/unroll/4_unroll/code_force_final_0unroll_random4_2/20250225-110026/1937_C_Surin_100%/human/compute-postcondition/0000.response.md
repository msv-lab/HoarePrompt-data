The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers. This function does not modify any existing variables and does not perform any operations on the input permutation `p` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply provides a convenient way to read and parse input.

Since the code snippet only defines a lambda function and does not execute any operations that affect the state of the program as described in the initial state, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the definition of the lambda function `I`.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interact with the interactor by making queries in the form "? a b c d" (where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) and receiving a response of "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The function must find a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized and print "! i j" for each test case. The total number of queries across all test cases must not exceed 3n, where n is the sum of lengths of all permutations. `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.**
