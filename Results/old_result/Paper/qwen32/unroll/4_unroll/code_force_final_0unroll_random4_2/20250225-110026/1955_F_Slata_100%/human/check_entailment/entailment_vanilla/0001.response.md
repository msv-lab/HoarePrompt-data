To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the logic behind the problem and then compare it with the logic used in the provided code.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers in the sequence is zero.

**Key Observations:**
1. XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
2. Since the numbers in the sequence are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we only need to consider the first two bits:
   - Number 1: Binary `01`
   - Number 2: Binary `10`
   - Number 3: Binary `11`
   - Number 4: Binary `00`
3. For the XOR to be zero, the count of numbers that have a `1` in the least significant bit (LSB) should be even, and the count of numbers that have a `1` in the second least significant bit (2nd LSB) should also be even.

**Strategy for Eve:**
- Eve should aim to maximize the number of games where the XOR is zero.
- Eve can do this by ensuring that after her removal, the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position remain even.

### Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by counting the pairs of numbers that can be removed without changing the parity of the XOR result.

**Code Breakdown:**
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This counts the number of pairs for each number type. Each pair ensures that the count of that number type remains even after removal.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This checks if there is an odd number of each type of number (1, 2, 3). If so, it means that after removing pairs, there will be one of each type left, and removing one of each will result in an XOR of zero.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring that Eve can always make the XOR zero by removing numbers optimally.

**Correctness: True**
