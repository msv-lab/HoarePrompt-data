You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:

for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)

def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if index != -1:
        return j + index
    else:
        return -1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings, i and j are non-negative integers representing the current indices of a and b respectively, such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b).
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the sum of `j` and the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`.
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j` as input. It returns the sum of `j` and the index of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` if `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]`. If `a[i]` is not found, it returns -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the code works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `i`, `j`, and `c` are initialized to 0. `i` keeps track of the current position in string \( a \), `j` keeps track of the current position in string \( b \), and `c` counts the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

2. **Main Loop**: The `while` loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of \( b \) and `i` is less than the length of \( a \). This ensures that we do not go out of bounds while checking for subsequences.

3. **Finding the Next Occurrence**: The function `func_1` is called with the current positions of `i` and `j` to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring of \( b \) starting from `j`. The function `find` is used to locate the index of `a[i]` in the substring of \( b \) starting from `j`. If found, the function returns the adjusted index; otherwise, it returns -1.

4. **Updating Pointers and Counter**: If `new_j` is not -1, it means `a[i]` was found in \( b \) starting from `j`. The pointers `j` and `i` are updated to the next positions, and the counter `c` is incremented. If `new_j` is -1, it means `a[i]` is not found in the remaining part of \( b \), and the loop breaks.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the value of `c` (the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \)) is printed.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the first test case from the problem description:

**Input:**
```
5 4
10011
1110
```

**Execution:**
- `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `c = 0`
- `func_1(a, b, 0, 0)` finds `a[0]` ('1') at `b[0]`, so `j` becomes 1, `i` becomes 1, `c` becomes 1.
- `func_1(a, b, 1, 1)` finds `a[1]` ('0') at `b[3]`, so `j` becomes 4, `i` becomes 2, `c` becomes 2.
- `func_1(a, b, 2, 4)` does not find `a[2]` ('0') in the remaining part of \( b \), so the loop breaks.
- Output: `2`

The program correctly handles this case and all other provided examples. There are no edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
