Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where the first two elements are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`.**

In simple terms: The `prime` list now has its first two elements (at indices 0 and 1) set to `False`, while all other elements remain `True`. The `Highest_Prime` and `Lowest_Prime` lists are unchanged, with all elements still set to `0`.
