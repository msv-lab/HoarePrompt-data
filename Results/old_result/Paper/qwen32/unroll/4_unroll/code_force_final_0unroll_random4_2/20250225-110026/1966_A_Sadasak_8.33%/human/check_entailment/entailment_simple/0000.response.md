### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of integers `nums` representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k > n` by printing `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - The program handles the case where `k == n` by printing `n - 1` because you can exchange all `n` cards for `n-1` cards.

3. **Core Logic**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to create a frequency table where the count of each number is limited to `k`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect for the problem. The function does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left. Instead, it should calculate how many cards can be removed based on the frequency of each number.

4. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true, otherwise it prints `n`. This logic does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each unique number in the list, calculate how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
   - For each group of `k` cards, replace them with `k-1` cards, which effectively reduces the count of that number by 1.
   - The final number of cards left will be the sum of the remaining counts of each number.

### Correctness:

Given the incorrect logic in the function `func_1` and the subsequent checks in the main loop, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    remaining_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        groups = count // k
        remaining_cards += count - groups
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by forming groups of `k` and replacing them with `k-1` cards.
