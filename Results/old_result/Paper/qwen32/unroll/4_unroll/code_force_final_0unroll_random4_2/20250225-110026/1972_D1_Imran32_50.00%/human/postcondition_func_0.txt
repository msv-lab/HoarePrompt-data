The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates a value `ans` based on `n`, and prints this value. The calculation involves summing up `n` plus the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)` for all `i` from `2` to the integer square root of `n` plus one. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value; it directly prints the result.
