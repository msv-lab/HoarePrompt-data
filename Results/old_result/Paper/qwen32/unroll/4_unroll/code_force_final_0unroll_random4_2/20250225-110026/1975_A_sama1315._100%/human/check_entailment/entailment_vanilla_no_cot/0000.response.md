To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to verify if it accurately solves the problem as described. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if it can be split and rearranged into a non-decreasing order by concatenating the array with itself and then checking if any subarray of length equal to the original array matches the sorted version of the array.

`func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

Let's analyze the correctness of `func_1`:

1. **Concatenation of the array with itself (`concatenated_a = a + a`)**: This is a valid approach because if we can rotate the array to become sorted, then the sorted version of the array must appear as a contiguous subarray in the doubled array. This is because any rotation of the array can be represented as a subarray in the doubled array.

2. **Checking for the sorted subarray**: The loop iterates over possible starting points in the doubled array, checking if any subarray of length `n` matches the sorted version of the array. If a match is found, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by splitting and swapping.

3. **Returning 'No' if no match is found**: If the loop completes without finding a matching subarray, the function returns 'No', indicating that it is not possible to rearrange the array into a non-decreasing order using the allowed operation.

Given this analysis, `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

`func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and outputs the results. It handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
