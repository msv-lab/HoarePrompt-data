You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the number of unique numbers in `a` after considering the bitwise flipped version of each number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is between 0 and 2^31 - 1. It calculates and returns the count of unique numbers in the list `a` after considering each number and its bitwise flipped version.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires dividing a set of integers into groups such that no two integers in the same group share any matching bits in their 31 least significant bits. The goal is to find the minimum number of such groups.

### Program Analysis:

The given program defines a function `func_1` which is supposed to compute the minimum number of groups required. Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - It initializes `res` to 0, which will store the result (minimum number of groups).
   - It uses a dictionary `count` to keep track of some kind of count related to the numbers.
   - For each number `num` in the list `a`:
     - It computes `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. This is equivalent to `num ^ 0x7FFFFFFF` (flipping the last 31 bits of `num`).
     - It checks if the flipped number is not in the `count` dictionary. If it is not, it adds the flipped number to the `count` dictionary with a count of 1 and increments `res` by 1.
     - If the flipped number is already in the `count` dictionary, it decrements the count of `num` in the `count` dictionary.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns `res`, which is supposed to be the minimum number of groups.

### Flaws in the Program:

The logic in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here are the issues:
- The program does not actually ensure that no two numbers in the same group share any matching bits in their 31 least significant bits.
- The use of `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` does not help in grouping the numbers correctly based on the problem's constraints.
- The decrementing of counts in the `count` dictionary does not make sense in the context of the problem.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve:
- Using a data structure to keep track of which bits are already used in each group.
- For each number, check which group it can be placed in without violating the condition.
- If no existing group can accommodate the number, create a new group.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the provided program, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
