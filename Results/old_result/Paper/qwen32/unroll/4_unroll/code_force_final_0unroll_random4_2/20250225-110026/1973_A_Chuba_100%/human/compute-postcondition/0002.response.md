Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each corresponding to the result of a test case. For each test case, if the sum of the scores (p_1 + p_2 + p_3) is odd, the output is '-1'. Otherwise, the output is the calculated result given by the formula (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)) // 2. The variables p_1, p_2, p_3, and t remain unchanged after the loop executes all iterations.**
