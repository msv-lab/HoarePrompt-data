Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each test case and processes the array to determine if it can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. It initializes `same` to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same.
4. It iterates through the array, updating `same` when consecutive elements are the same.
5. When it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count of consecutive elements (`minn`) and resets `same`.
6. After the loop, it checks the last sequence of elements.
7. If `minn` is still `inf` (which means no different elements were found) or if the entire array is composed of the same element (`minn == len(ar)`), it prints `-1` (impossible to make non-beautiful).
8. Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

### Correctness Evaluation:
Let's evaluate the correctness of the program using the provided examples and the logic described:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `3, 2 2 2`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The entire array is the same, and it's impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5, 1 2 1 2 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) results in an array that cannot be made uniform using the given operation.
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `1, 1`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The array is already uniform and cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `7, 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Removing the first three `3`s results in an array that cannot be made uniform.
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

Based on the examples, the program seems to correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove or conclude that it's impossible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-beautiful and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove when possible.

Correctness: **True**
