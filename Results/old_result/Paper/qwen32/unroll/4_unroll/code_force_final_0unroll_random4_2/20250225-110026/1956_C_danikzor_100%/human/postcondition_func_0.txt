The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the size of an n Ã— n matrix and prints a specific sequence of lines. For each test case, it prints the value `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` followed by `2 * n`, and then outputs `2 * n` lines, each consisting of either "1 i n (n-1) ... 2 1" or "2 i n (n-1) ... 2 1" for i ranging from 1 to n.
