The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the value of `n` remains as it was read from the input, and `ans` now holds the same value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `ans` is equal to `n`.**
