To determine the output state after the loop has executed, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` variable. The loop iterates `m` times, and in each iteration, it updates `ans` based on the values returned by `func_1()`, which are `r` and `c`. The variable `ans` is a set of integers, and in each iteration, it is updated to include new values calculated based on the current values in `ans` and the conditions specified by `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:
1. For each iteration, `r` and `c` are obtained from `func_1()`.
2. `r` is converted to an integer.
3. A temporary set `temp` is initialized.
4. For each element `q` in `ans`:
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
5. After the inner loop, `ans` is updated to be the set `temp`.

The output state will be the final value of `ans` after `m` iterations. Since the exact values of `r` and `c` in each iteration are not specified, the final set `ans` will depend on these values. However, we can describe the output state in terms of how `ans` is transformed.

Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers resulting from the transformations specified by `r` and `c` over `m` iterations. The initial set `ans` is derived from the value of `x` returned by `func_3()`, and in each iteration, it is updated to include new values calculated as `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c`.**

In simpler terms:
Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers that have been transformed through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations.**
