Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the logic for determining whether it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases, while maintaining tangency, is flawed.

Here are some key issues with the program:

1. **DFS Implementation**: The `dfs` function is defined but not properly integrated into the main function `func_1`. The variable `n` is referenced inside `dfs`, but it is not defined within that function's scope. Additionally, the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are also referenced inside `dfs` but not passed as arguments or defined within `dfs`.

2. **Logic for Checking Radii Adjustments**: The program checks if there is at least one component in the graph of tangent disks where the sum of coefficients (`c1`) is not zero. This logic does not correctly determine whether the radii can be adjusted such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are supposed to help in calculating the feasibility of radius adjustments, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

3. **Graph Representation**: The program does not explicitly represent the graph of tangent disks, which would be necessary to properly analyze the feasibility of adjusting the radii.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:

- Build an adjacency list representing the graph of tangent disks.
- Use a graph traversal algorithm (such as DFS or BFS) to explore each connected component of the graph.
- For each connected component, determine if it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. This could involve checking if the system of linear equations derived from the tangency conditions has a solution that satisfies the constraints.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.
