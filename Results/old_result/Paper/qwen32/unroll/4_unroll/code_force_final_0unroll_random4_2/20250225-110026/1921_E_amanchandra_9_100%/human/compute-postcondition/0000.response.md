Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w; It is guaranteed that either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to an input integer within the specified range. The other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) retain their initial states as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.
