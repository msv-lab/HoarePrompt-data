Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the number of test cases specified by the input `t`. The program assumes there will always be exactly 10 test cases, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem description states that the number of test cases can be between 1 and 100, inclusive. Therefore, the program should use the value of `t` to determine the number of iterations for reading the test cases and processing them.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
t = input()
x = []
y = []
for i in range(10):  # This should be range(int(t)) to handle the actual number of test cases
    xylist = input().split(' ')
    x.append(int(xylist[0]))
    y.append(int(xylist[1]))
for i in range(10):  # This should also be range(int(t))
    if x[i] < y[i]:
        print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
    else:
        print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

To fix this, the code should be modified to use `int(t)` in the range functions:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Convert t to an integer
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(t):  # Use t to determine the number of test cases
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(t):  # Use t to determine the number of test cases
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], y[i])  # Removed unnecessary space
        else:
            print(y[i], x[i])  # Removed unnecessary space
```

With these changes, the program will correctly handle any number of test cases between 1 and 100, inclusive.
