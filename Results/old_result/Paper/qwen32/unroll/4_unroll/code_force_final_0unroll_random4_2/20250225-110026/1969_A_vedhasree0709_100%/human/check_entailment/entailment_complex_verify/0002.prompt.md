You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].

        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:

            q = l[p - 1]

                j = 1

        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The final printed value (either 2 or 3) after processing all test cases. The variables `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` are in their final states from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. It checks if there is a cycle of length 2 in the permutation defined by `p` and prints `2` if such a cycle exists, otherwise it prints `3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. A friend will attend if both they and their best friend receive invitations. The key points are:
- For each friend `i`, their best friend is `p_i`, and `p_i` is unique and different from `i`.
- We need to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list of best friends. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
3. It initializes two variables `i` and `j`.
4. It then enters a `while` loop that iterates through each friend.
5. Inside the loop, it retrieves the best friend of the current friend (`p = l[i]`).
6. It then retrieves the best friend of the best friend (`q = l[p - 1]`).
7. It checks if `q` is equal to the current friend plus one (`q == i + 1`). If this condition is true, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1`, breaking out of the loop.
8. If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Analysis:
The program's logic is flawed. Here's why:
- The condition `q == i + 1` checks if the best friend of the best friend is the current friend. However, this only identifies a mutual best friend relationship, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of invitations needed.
- The program assumes that if such a mutual best friend relationship exists, only 2 invitations are needed. This is not always true. There could be cases where more than 2 invitations are required.
- The program does not account for all possible configurations of best friend relationships that could require more than 2 invitations.

### Example Counter-case:
Consider the following test case:
```
2
4
2 3 4 1
4
1 4 3 2
```
For the first test case, the program correctly outputs `3` because sending invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 is necessary. However, the second test case should also output `3`, but the program incorrectly outputs `2` because it finds a mutual best friend relationship between friends 1 and 4.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all scenarios and does not always determine the minimum number of invitations required.
