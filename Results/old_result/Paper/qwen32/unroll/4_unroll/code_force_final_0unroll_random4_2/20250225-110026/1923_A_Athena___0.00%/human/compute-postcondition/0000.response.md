The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided by the user, and it will still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 1000. The other variables `n` and the list `a_i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `a_i` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one `a_i` that equals 1.**
