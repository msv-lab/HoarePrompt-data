You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: a series of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, with 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'AB' repeated `n // 2` times for even `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in it. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Key Points:
1. **Special Character Definition**: A character is special if it is different from one neighbor and the same as the other.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - The number of test cases `t` can be up to 50.
   - The number of special characters `n` can be up to 50.
3. **Output Requirements**:
   - If no suitable string can be constructed, output "NO".
   - Otherwise, output "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's not possible to have an odd number of special characters in such a way that each special character is part of a pair.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string by alternating pairs of characters ('A' and 'B') and prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Odd `n` Case**:
   - The program correctly identifies that an odd number of special characters cannot be formed under the given constraints and outputs "NO".
2. **Even `n` Case**:
   - The program constructs a string by alternating 'A' and 'B' pairs, which ensures that each pair contributes exactly 2 special characters (one 'A' and one 'B').
   - For example, for `n = 6`, the string "AABBAA" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, which matches the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles both the odd and even cases for `n` and constructs a valid string when `n` is even. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
