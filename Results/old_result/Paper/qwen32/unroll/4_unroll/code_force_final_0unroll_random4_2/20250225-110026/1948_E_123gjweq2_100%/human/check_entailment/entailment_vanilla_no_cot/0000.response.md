Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables**: The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays used in `make_array` are not defined globally. They are only initialized within `func_1`, but `make_array` does not have access to them unless they are passed as arguments or defined as global variables.

2. **Logic of make_array**: The logic for filling `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that all vertices are connected according to the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k`. The current implementation does not guarantee that the vertices within the same clique satisfy this condition.

3. **Clustering into Cliques**: The calculation of `cliques` as `ceil(n / k)` is not necessarily correct for the problem. The number of cliques depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` and the assignment of `a_i`.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It does not loop through all test cases provided in the input.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases, such as when `k` is very small or very large relative to `n`.

To fix the program, you need to ensure that the assignment of `a_i` and the creation of cliques correctly reflect the problem constraints. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    # Assign values to vertices
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliques = []
    clique = []

    for i in range(n):
        if not clique or all(abs(i + 1 - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j - 1]) <= k for j in clique):
            clique.append(i + 1)
        else:
            cliques.append(clique)
            clique = [i + 1]
    if clique:
        cliques.append(clique)

    # Output the results
    print(*arr)
    print(len(cliques))
    clique_labels = []
    for i, clique in enumerate(cliques):
        clique_labels.extend([i + 1] * len(clique))
    print(*clique_labels)

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        solve(n, k)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected version ensures that the vertices are assigned distinct integers and that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques according to the problem constraints.
