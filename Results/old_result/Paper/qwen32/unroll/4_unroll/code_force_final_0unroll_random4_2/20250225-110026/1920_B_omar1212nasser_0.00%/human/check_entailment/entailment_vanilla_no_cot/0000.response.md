Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_2` contains a hardcoded return value for a specific case and does not correctly handle the general case of the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Hardcoded Case Handling**: The function `func_2` has a hardcoded check for `removals == 6 and negatives == 3` and returns `0` in that case. This is not a general solution and will fail for other test cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Sum Calculation**:
    - The function calculates the sum `s` of all elements.
    - It calculates the sum `n` of the last `negatives` elements.
    - It then calculates `pos` as `s - 2 * n`, which is not the correct way to determine the optimal sum after Alice's and Bob's moves.
    - The loop tries to adjust `s` and `n` for different numbers of removals, but the logic inside the loop is incorrect and does not account for Bob's optimal strategy of flipping the smallest elements to negative.

3. **Bob's Optimal Strategy**: Bob should flip the smallest elements to negative to minimize the sum. The program does not correctly implement this strategy.

4. **Alice's Optimal Strategy**: Alice should remove the largest elements to maximize the sum after her move. The program does not correctly implement this strategy.

To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be taken:
- First, sort the array.
- Alice should remove the `k` largest elements.
- Bob should flip the `x` smallest elements among the remaining elements to negative.
- Calculate the final sum after these operations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Remove k largest elements
        a = a[:-k] if k < n else []
        
        # Bob flips x smallest elements to negative
        for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

func_1()
```

This corrected version handles the problem requirements correctly and should produce the correct output for all valid test cases.
