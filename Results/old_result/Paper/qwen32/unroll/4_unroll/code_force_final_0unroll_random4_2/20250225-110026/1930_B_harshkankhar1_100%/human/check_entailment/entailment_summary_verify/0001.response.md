To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether it consistently generates a permutation \( p \) for each test case such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) for which \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and for each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads the integer \( n \).
2. Creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
3. Reverses the elements at even indices in the list.
4. Prints the modified list.

### Function Summary

The function `func_1`:
- Reads an integer \( n \).
- Creates a list `a` of integers from 1 to \( n \).
- Reverses the elements at even indices.
- Prints the modified list.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the provided examples:

#### Test Case 1: \( n = 4 \)

- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- After reversing the even-indexed elements: `[1, 4, 3, 2]`

Now, let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- \( p_1 = 1, p_2 = 4, p_3 = 3, p_4 = 2 \)
- There are no pairs \((i, j)\) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \):
  - For \( i = 1 \), \( j = 2 \): \( p_1 = 1 \) divides \( p_2 = 4 \), but \( p_2 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 3 \).
  - For \( i = 2 \), \( j = 3 \): \( p_2 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 3 \).
  - For \( i = 3 \), \( j = 4 \): \( p_3 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 2 \).

#### Test Case 2: \( n = 3 \)

- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3]`
- After reversing the even-indexed elements: `[1, 2, 3]` (no change as there's only one even index, which is 2, and it is the same in the reversed list)

Now, let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- \( p_1 = 1, p_2 = 2, p_3 = 3 \)
- There are no pairs \((i, j)\) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \):
  - For \( i = 1 \), \( j = 2 \): \( p_1 = 1 \) divides \( p_2 = 2 \), but \( p_2 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 3 \).

### General Case

The provided program reverses the even-indexed elements of the list. Let's analyze whether this approach guarantees a valid permutation:
1. **Odd-Indexed Elements (1, 3, 5, ...)**: These elements remain in their original order. Since they are in increasing order, no two elements can satisfy the condition \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) because \( i \) and \( j \) are odd and \( i+1 \) and \( j+1 \) are even, making the condition impossible to satisfy with these elements.
2. **Even-Indexed Elements (2, 4, 6, ...)**: These elements are in decreasing order. Any two even-indexed elements \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) will not satisfy the condition \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) because \( i \) and \( j \) are even and \( i+1 \) and \( j+1 \) are odd, making the condition impossible to satisfy with these elements.
3. **Cross-Indexed Elements (odd and even)**: The only possible scenario is when \( i \) is odd and \( j \) is even (or vice versa). In this case, \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) cannot satisfy the condition \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) because \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_{j+1} \) will be of opposite parity (one even and one odd), making the condition impossible to satisfy.

### Conclusion

The provided program generates a permutation that satisfies the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
