Each test case consists of three positive integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), where a and b represent the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m represents the duration (in minutes) that each firework is visible in the sky after launch. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.
