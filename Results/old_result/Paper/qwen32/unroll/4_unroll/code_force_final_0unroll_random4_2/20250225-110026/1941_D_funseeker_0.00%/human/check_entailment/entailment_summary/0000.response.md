### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws in a circular arrangement of players. The throws can be either clockwise or counterclockwise, and some directions are unknown.

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string. This is a standard way to read input lines in Python.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calls `func_1` to read a line from input and converts that line to an integer. This is used to read the number of test cases.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads a line from input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function performs the core logic of the problem:
     - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
     - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
     - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the player number `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the player number `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to `temp`.
     - It handles the case where `0` might be in the set by replacing it with `n`.
     - Finally, it prints the number of possible player positions and the sorted list of these positions.

### Correctness:
The logic in `func_4` correctly handles the problem requirements:
- It initializes the set with the starting player.
- It processes each throw correctly based on the direction.
- It handles the circular nature of the players using modulo operations.
- It correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`'?'`), considering both possible directions.
- It ensures that the output is in increasing order and does not include `0`.

Given that all functions work together as intended and the logic aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
