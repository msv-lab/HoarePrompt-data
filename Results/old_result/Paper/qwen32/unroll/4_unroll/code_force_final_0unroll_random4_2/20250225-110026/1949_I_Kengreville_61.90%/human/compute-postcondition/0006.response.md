Functionality: **The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It uses the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` to access the coordinates and radius of the disks, the list `visited` to track which disks have been visited, the list `nodes` to store the indices of disks in the current connected component, and the lists `coef0` and `coef1` to store coefficients for system equations. The function performs a depth-first search to explore and mark the connected component of disks starting from disk `i`.**
