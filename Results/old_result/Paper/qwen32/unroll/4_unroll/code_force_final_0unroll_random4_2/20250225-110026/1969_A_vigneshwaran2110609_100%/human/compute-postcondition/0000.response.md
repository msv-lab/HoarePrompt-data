The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 50`. After executing this line, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user input, which must still satisfy the condition `2 <= n <= 50`. The variable `t` and the list `p` remain unchanged and retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 (as provided by the user input); `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].**
