You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, and p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: p1, p2, p3, p4



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the logic behind the problem and then compare it with the logic used in the provided code.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers in the sequence is zero.

**Key Observations:**
1. XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
2. Since the numbers in the sequence are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we only need to consider the first two bits:
   - Number 1: Binary `01`
   - Number 2: Binary `10`
   - Number 3: Binary `11`
   - Number 4: Binary `00`
3. For the XOR to be zero, the count of numbers that have a `1` in the least significant bit (LSB) should be even, and the count of numbers that have a `1` in the second least significant bit (2nd LSB) should also be even.

**Strategy for Eve:**
- Eve should aim to maximize the number of games where the XOR is zero.
- Eve can do this by ensuring that after her removal, the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position remain even.

### Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by counting the pairs of numbers that can be removed without changing the parity of the XOR result.

**Code Breakdown:**
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This counts the number of pairs for each number type. Each pair ensures that the count of that number type remains even after removal.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This checks if there is an odd number of each type of number (1, 2, 3). If so, it means that after removing pairs, there will be one of each type left, and removing one of each will result in an XOR of zero.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring that Eve can always make the XOR zero by removing numbers optimally.
