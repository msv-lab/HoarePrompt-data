Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins using at most 60 stalls.

Here are a few issues with the current implementation:
1. The function `func_1` does not properly distribute the cost of the jewels across the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. The logic for calculating the number of stalls and their respective prices is flawed. The example provided in the problem statement shows a more sophisticated approach where the prices are strategically set to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
3. The function does not handle cases where `n` is much larger than `k` or vice versa, and it does not ensure that the number of stalls is minimized or within the limit of 60.
4. The function does not guarantee that the sum of the jewels bought from each stall equals `k`.

Let's consider a specific case that the program does not handle correctly:

Input:
```
1
255 8
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
2
248 1
```

In this example, the program incorrectly sets up only two stalls with prices 248 and 1, which does not ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. Instead, it should set up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, as shown in the expected output.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and the Correctness is **False**.
