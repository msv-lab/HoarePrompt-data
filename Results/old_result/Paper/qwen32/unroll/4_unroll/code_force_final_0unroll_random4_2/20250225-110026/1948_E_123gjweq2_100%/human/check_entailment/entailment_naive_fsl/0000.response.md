Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. These variables should be passed as parameters to the functions to ensure they are correctly initialized and used within the scope of each test case.

2. **Initialization of Arrays**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized with zeros. However, the problem requires `arr` to contain distinct integers from 1 to n. The program does not ensure this.

3. **Logic for Array Construction**: The logic in `make_array` for filling `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that the values in `arr` are distinct integers from 1 to n and that the conditions for edge creation are met.

4. **Edge Condition Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the edge conditions for the graph construction, specifically the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the results directly within the function, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:

Let's consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`.

- The program initializes `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
- The function `make_array` attempts to fill these arrays but does not ensure that `arr` contains distinct integers from 1 to 5.
- The logic for partitioning the graph into cliques based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is not correctly implemented.

For `n = 5` and `k = 4`, a correct solution could be:
- `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `cliques = 1`
- `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

This is because with `arr` being a simple sequence from 1 to 5, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices, and thus, all vertices can be in the same clique.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements and fails to produce the correct output for at least one test case. Therefore, it is incorrect.
