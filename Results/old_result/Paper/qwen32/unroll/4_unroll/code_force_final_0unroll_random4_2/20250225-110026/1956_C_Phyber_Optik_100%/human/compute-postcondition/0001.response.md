The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a conventional name for a variable that we don't plan to use, it doesn't need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The state of `t` is the only one we need to ensure is correct for the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1**
