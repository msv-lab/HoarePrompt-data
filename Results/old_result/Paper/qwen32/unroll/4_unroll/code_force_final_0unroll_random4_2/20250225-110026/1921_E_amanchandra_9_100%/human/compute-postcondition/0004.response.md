Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of grid dimensions `h` and `w`, and coordinates of two distinct points `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` on the grid. For each test case, it determines and prints the result of a game where Alice and Bob compete based on their positions and the grid dimensions. The result can be 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.**
