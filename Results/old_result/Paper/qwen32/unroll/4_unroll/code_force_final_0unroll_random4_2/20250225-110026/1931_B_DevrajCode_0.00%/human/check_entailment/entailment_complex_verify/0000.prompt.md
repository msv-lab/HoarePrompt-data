You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Annotated Code:

n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n; `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, and `total_water % n` equals 0
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: container is 0.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the elements of `a` such that each element becomes equal to the average of the list. If it is possible, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error that could lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle scenarios where the water distribution cannot be equalized due to the constraints of the operation (pouring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container).

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The function checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target water level ever goes negative. If it does, it returns 'No'. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of redistributing water in subsequent steps to balance out the negative difference.

2. **Example Case**:
   Consider the following test case:
   ```
   3
   1 2 3
   ```
   - The total water is 6, and the target for each container is 2.
   - The first container has 1 unit of water, which is 1 unit less than the target.
   - The second container has 2 units of water, which is exactly the target.
   - The third container has 3 units of water, which is 1 unit more than the target.

   According to the logic in `func_1`, the cumulative difference would be:
   - After the first container: `-1` (1 - 2)
   - After the second container: `-1` (1 - 2 + 2 - 2)
   - After the third container: `0` (-1 + 3 - 2)

   Since the cumulative difference never goes negative, the function would return 'Yes', which is incorrect. In reality, it is impossible to make all containers have 2 units of water given the constraint of pouring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container.

3. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that at no point do we try to pour water from a container that already has less water than the target into another container. This requires a more nuanced approach to verify if the water can be redistributed according to the given rules.

Given these points, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
