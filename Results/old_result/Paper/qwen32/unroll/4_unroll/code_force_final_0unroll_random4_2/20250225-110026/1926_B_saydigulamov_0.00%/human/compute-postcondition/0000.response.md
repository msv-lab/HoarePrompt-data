Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. `a` is an input integer. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid. The next `n` lines each contain a string of `n` characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid is guaranteed to contain exactly one triangle or exactly one square formed by the '1's, and the size of the shape (number of rows of '1's) is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the number of test cases `t`. The other parts of the input description remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.
