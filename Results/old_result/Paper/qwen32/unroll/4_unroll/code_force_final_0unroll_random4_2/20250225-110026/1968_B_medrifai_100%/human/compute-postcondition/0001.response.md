Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the current indices of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b). The position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]` is not `-1`, meaning `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]` at some index `index`.**
