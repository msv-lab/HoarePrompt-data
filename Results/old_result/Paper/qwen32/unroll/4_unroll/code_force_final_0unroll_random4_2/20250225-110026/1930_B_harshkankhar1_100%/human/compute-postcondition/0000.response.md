The code snippet creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is provided as input. The variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and the initial condition for `n` in each test case remain unchanged. The list `a` is newly created and will be specific to the value of `n` provided during the execution of the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`. The sum of all `n` across the test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
