Precondition: **Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Following these integers, there is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The number of test cases t is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
