To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

The program iterates through multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. It then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the following logic:

1. **Initial Check for Bob's Win:**
   - If the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd, Bob can win once initially because the XOR of three odd counts of 1, 2, and 3 will be zero.

2. **Counting Half of Each Number:**
   - For each number type (ones, twos, threes, fours), it adds the integer division of the count by 2 to the result. This is because each pair of identical numbers will cancel each other out in the XOR operation, effectively reducing the problem size by half.

### Testing the Program:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
     - Counts: `1, 1, 1, 0`
     - Initial check: `1 % 2 == 1 % 2 == 1 % 2 == 1` → True, so `cnt += 1`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) = 0`
     - Total: `1`
     - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
     - Counts: `1, 0, 1, 2`
     - Initial check: `1 % 2 == 0 % 2 == 1 % 2 == 1` → False, so `cnt += 0`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) = 1`
     - Total: `1`
     - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
     - Counts: `2, 2, 2, 0`
     - Initial check: `2 % 2 == 2 % 2 == 2 % 2 == 1` → False, so `cnt += 0`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 3`
     - Total: `3`
     - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
     - Counts: `3, 3, 2, 0`
     - Initial check: `3 % 2 == 3 % 2 == 2 % 2 == 1` → False, so `cnt += 0`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 3`
     - Total: `3`
     - Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Example:**
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
     - Counts: `0, 9, 9, 9`
     - Initial check: `0 % 2 == 9 % 2 == 9 % 2 == 1` → False, so `cnt += 0`
     - Counting pairs: `floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) = 12`
     - Total: `12`
     - Output: `12` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program seems to be correctly implementing the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case. It correctly handles the initial check for an immediate win and counts pairs of numbers that cancel each other out.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all the provided examples correctly.
