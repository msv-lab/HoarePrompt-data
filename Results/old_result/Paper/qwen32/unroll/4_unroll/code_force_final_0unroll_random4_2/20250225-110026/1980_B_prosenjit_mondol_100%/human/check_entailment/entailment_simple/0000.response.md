### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not based on the sorting and removal rules provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` where:
     - `n` is the number of cubes.
     - `f` is the index of Dmitry's favorite cube.
     - `k` is the number of cubes to be removed.
   - It also reads the list of values `a` shown on the cubes.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from each.

3. **Storing the Value of the Favorite Cube:**
   - It stores the value of the favorite cube in the variable `x`.

4. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - The program then compares the value of the favorite cube (`x`) with the value of the cube at the `k`-th position in the sorted list.
   - If the value at the `k`-th position is greater than `x`, it means that the favorite cube will definitely not be removed (since it is ranked higher than the `k`-th cube), so it prints "NO".
   - If the value at the `k`-th position is less than `x`, it means that the favorite cube will definitely be removed (since it is ranked lower than the `k`-th cube), so it prints "YES".
   - If the value at the `k`-th position is equal to `x`, it checks if `k` is the last position (`n-1`) or if the value at the `(k+1)`-th position is less than `x`. If either condition is true, it prints "YES" (since the favorite cube can be removed in some cases). Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE" (since the favorite cube could either be removed or not removed depending on the exact order of cubes with the same value).

### Verification:

The logic described above matches the problem requirements. The program correctly handles all the edge cases:
- When the favorite cube is guaranteed to be removed.
- When the favorite cube is guaranteed not to be removed.
- When the favorite cube might or might not be removed based on the order of cubes with the same value.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as per the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
