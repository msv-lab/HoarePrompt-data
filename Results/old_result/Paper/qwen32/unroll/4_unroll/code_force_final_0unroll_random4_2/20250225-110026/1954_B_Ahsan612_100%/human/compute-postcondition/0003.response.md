Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers in the list. If the entire list consists of a single segment of identical numbers, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the minimum length of these segments.**
