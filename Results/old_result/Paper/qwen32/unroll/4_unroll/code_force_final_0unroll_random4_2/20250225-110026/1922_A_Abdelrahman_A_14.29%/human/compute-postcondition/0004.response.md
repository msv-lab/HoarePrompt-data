Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if a given string `c` is identical to either of two other strings `a` or `b`. If `c` is identical to either, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if every character in `c` is present in either `a` or `b`. If all characters in `c` are found in `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
