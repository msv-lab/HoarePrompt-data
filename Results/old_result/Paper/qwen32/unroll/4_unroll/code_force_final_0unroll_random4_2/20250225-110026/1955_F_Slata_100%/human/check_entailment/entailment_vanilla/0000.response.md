To determine if the given program is correct, we need to understand the game mechanics and how Eve can optimally remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

### Game Mechanics Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time until the sequence is empty.

### Key Insight:
- The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
- Therefore, Bob wins when the counts of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) can be paired up such that the remaining numbers have an even count for each bit position.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the counts of each number (1, 2, 3, 4).
- For each number type, it calculates how many pairs can be formed (`x // 2`) and adds the result.
- It also checks if there are exactly three odd counts among the four numbers. If so, it adds one more to the result. This is because having three odd counts results in an overall even count for the XOR operation.

### Correctness Check:
Let's break down the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `1//2 + 1//2 + 1//2 + 0//2 + int(1%2 + 1%2 + 1%2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1` = `1`
   - Explanation: Bob wins when no numbers are removed (since XOR of [1, 1, 1] is 1, but removing one number makes it zero).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `1//2 + 0//2 + 1//2 + 2//2 + int(1%2 + 0%2 + 1%2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0` = `1`
   - Explanation: Bob wins if Eve removes one 1 and one 3, leaving [2, 2, 4].

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `2//2 + 2//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + int(2%2 + 2%2 + 2%2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0` = `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs of numbers.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `3//2 + 3//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + int(3%2 + 3%2 + 2%2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1` = `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs of numbers.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `0//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + int(0%2 + 9%2 + 9%2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1` = `12`
   - Explanation: Bob wins twelve times by removing pairs of numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the optimal removal strategy of Eve. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
