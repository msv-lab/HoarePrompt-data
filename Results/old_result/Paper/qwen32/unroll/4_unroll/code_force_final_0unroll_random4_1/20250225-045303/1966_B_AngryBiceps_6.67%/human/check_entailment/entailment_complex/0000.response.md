### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using a specific operation. The key observation here is that if the first row is uniform (all squares in the row are the same color) and different from the last row, or if the first column is uniform and different from the last column, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because there will be no way to change the color of the squares in the rows or columns that are uniform and different from each other.

The program correctly implements this logic by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself.
3. Checking if the first row is uniform and different from the last row.
4. Checking if the first column is uniform and different from the last column.
5. Printing "NO" if either of the above conditions is true; otherwise, printing "YES".

The program uses a set to determine if a row or column is uniform by checking if the length of the set of characters in that row or column is 1. It also compares the first and last rows directly, and constructs the first and last columns by appending the first and last characters of each row to `first_row` and `last_row`, respectively.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
