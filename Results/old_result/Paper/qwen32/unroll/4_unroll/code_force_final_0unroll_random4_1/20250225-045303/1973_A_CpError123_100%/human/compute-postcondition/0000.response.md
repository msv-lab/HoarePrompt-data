Output State: **Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is assigned the value of the integer input by the user. The conditions and constraints for `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are part of the problem description and not affected by the input of `t`.
