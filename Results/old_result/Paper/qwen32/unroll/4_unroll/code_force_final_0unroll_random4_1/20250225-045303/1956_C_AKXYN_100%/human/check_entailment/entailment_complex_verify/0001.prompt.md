You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    #State: The output will be a series of printed lines for each test case, with the final printed lines being the result of the last test case. Specifically, it will be `res` and `2 * n` followed by the patterns printed in the nested loops for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the size of an `n × n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific result based on `n`, followed by a series of formatted lines indicating patterns related to the matrix size.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations. There are two types of operations:
1. Type 1: Choose a row and fill it with a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
2. Type 2: Choose a column and fill it with a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

The optimal strategy to maximize the sum is to fill each row and each column with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n]. This ensures that every element in the matrix is filled with the maximum possible value it can take.

### Program Analysis:
The program does the following:
1. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix n.
2. It initializes a matrix `mat` where each row is filled with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n].
3. It calculates the sum `res` of the matrix, which should be the sum of the first n natural numbers, each appearing in the matrix in a way that maximizes the overall sum. The formula used for `res` is `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is not the correct formula for the sum of the matrix.
4. It prints the calculated sum `res` and the number of operations (which is `2 * n`).
5. It then prints the operations: for each row and column, it prints the operation of filling it with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n].

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not correctly calculate the sum of the matrix. The correct sum of the matrix when each row and column is filled with [1, 2, 3, ..., n] is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.
2. **Output Format**: The operations are printed correctly, but the sum is not.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the sum calculation, the program is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation:
To correct the program, we need to change the sum calculation to `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Correct sum calculation
        res = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

Correctness: **False**
