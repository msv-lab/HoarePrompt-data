Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible for Nikita to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Even and Odd Moves**:
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect. The variable `a` here refers to the number of test cases, not the number of moves `n`. This condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2` to check if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd).

2. **Handling the Case When `b == c`**:
   - The condition `if b == c: print('YES')` is correct. If the number of moves `n` is equal to the number of cubes `m`, it is possible to build the tower by adding one cube per move.

3. **Handling the Case When `b < c`**:
   - The condition `elif b < c: print('NO')` is also correct. If the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`, it is not possible to build the tower because Nikita can only add one cube per move.

4. **Handling the Case When `b > c`**:
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2: print('Yes')` is incorrect for the reason mentioned above. It should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2: print('Yes')`. This is because if `n` and `m` have the same parity, it is possible to reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes in `n` moves by adding and removing cubes appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

In this corrected version, the condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2: print('YES')` ensures that the parity of `n` and `m` is checked correctly, which is necessary for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
