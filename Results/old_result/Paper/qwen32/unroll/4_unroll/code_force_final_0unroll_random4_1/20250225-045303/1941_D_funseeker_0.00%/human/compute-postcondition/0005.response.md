The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the value `0` from the set `ans` if it exists. Since the initial state specifies that `0` is in `ans`, the value `0` will be removed from `ans` after the code is executed. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `discard` operation.

Output State: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_3()`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is the third value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is the set of values resulting from the loop transformations with `0` removed.**
