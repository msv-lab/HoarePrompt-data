To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the given code and understand the transformations applied to the variables.

### Initial State:
- `n`: First value returned by `func_3()`
- `m`: Second value returned by `func_3()`
- `x`: Third value returned by `func_3()`
- `ans`: A set containing `x`, i.e., `ans = {x}`

### Loop Code Analysis:
The loop runs `m` times. In each iteration, it performs the following steps:
1. It gets two values `r` and `c` from `func_1()`, where `r` is converted to an integer.
2. It initializes an empty set `temp`.
3. It then iterates over each element `q` in the set `ans`:
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
4. After processing all elements in `ans`, it updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

### Output State Explanation:
The loop essentially transforms the set `ans` based on the operations defined by `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()`. The set `ans` starts with a single element `x` and, after `m` iterations, will contain elements that are the result of repeatedly applying the transformations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` (or both, if `c` is '?').

Since the exact values of `r` and `c` are not specified and can vary with each iteration, the final set `ans` will depend on these values. However, the format of the output state will remain the same, with `n`, `m`, and `x` retaining their initial values, and `ans` being the resulting set after all iterations.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_3()`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is the third value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is the set of values resulting from the loop transformations.**
