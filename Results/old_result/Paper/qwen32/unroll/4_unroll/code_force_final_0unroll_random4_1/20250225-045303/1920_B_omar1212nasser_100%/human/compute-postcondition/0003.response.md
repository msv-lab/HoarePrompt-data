The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements of the `elements` list and assigns this sum to the variable `s2`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers, elements is a list of integers; pos is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`; s is the sum of elements; s2 is the sum of elements[-negatives:]**.
