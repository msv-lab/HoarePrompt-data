Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then calculating the minimum cost to buy the required number of tickets. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. The program incorrectly calculates the cost. The cost calculation does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases. Specifically, the cost calculation does not properly handle the incremental increase in prices after each purchase.

2. The logic for splitting the purchase into batches of `m` tickets is flawed. The program does not correctly distribute the purchases over the days while considering the increasing prices.

3. The program uses `m` incorrectly. The variable `m` is intended to represent the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day, but it is used in the cost calculation as if it were a monetary value.

4. The cost calculation for the last batch of tickets is incorrect. The last batch may not contain `m` tickets, and the cost calculation does not account for this.

5. The program does not handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought is less than `m` correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the minimum cost needs to be reworked to correctly account for the increasing prices and the constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased per day.

Correctness: **False**
