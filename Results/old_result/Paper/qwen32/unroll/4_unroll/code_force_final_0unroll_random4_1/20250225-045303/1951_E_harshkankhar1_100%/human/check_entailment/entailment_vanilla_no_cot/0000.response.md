Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that can lead to incorrect results. Here are the main problems:

1. **Handling of Input and Output:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input directly from the standard input, which is not suitable for a function that should be able to handle multiple test cases in a structured manner.
   - The program does not loop through the number of test cases `t` provided in the input.

2. **Logic Errors:**
   - The program only checks for a single non-palindromic substring or tries to split the string into two parts. It does not handle more complex cases where the string needs to be split into more than two parts.
   - The logic for handling the case when the entire string is a palindrome is incorrect. It does not correctly identify when a valid partition is not possible.
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the string can be split into more than two parts, such as the example `uwuowouwu` which can be split into `uw`, `uow`, `ouwu`.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format for the partitioned strings is incorrect. There should not be a space between the substrings in the output.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases and loop through each test case.
- For each test case, determine a valid partition if possible.
- Ensure that the output format is correct and that the partitioned strings are printed without extra spaces.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input[index]
        index += 1
        n = len(s)
        if not is_palindrome(s):
            results.append("YES")
            results.append("1")
            results.append(s)
            continue
        
        found = False
        for i in range(1, n):
            if not is_palindrome(s[:i]):
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    if not is_palindrome(s[i:j]) and not is_palindrome(s[j:]):
                        results.append("YES")
                        results.append("3")
                        results.append(s[:i])
                        results.append(s[i:j])
                        results.append(s[j:])
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
        
        if not found:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# To run the function, you would call solve() with the input provided through standard input.
```

This corrected version reads all input at once, processes each test case, and handles the partitioning logic more robustly.
