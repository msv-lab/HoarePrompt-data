Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n × n matrix a filled with zeroes. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and the sum of n^2 over all test cases not exceeding 5 × 10^5.**

In simple terms: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer input by the user. The other conditions about the test cases and matrices remain unchanged.
