### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary provided. We'll verify if the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by analyzing the logic and test cases.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Winning Condition**: Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.
2. **Game Dynamics**: Eve removes one number at a time, and Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers until the sequence is empty.
3. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the following logic:
- **Counting Pairs**: For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), it counts the number of pairs (`a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, `d // 2`). Each pair will result in a zero XOR for that type of number, contributing to Bob's wins.
- **Handling Odd Counts**: It checks if there is exactly one number left for each type (1, 2, 3) after pairing. If that's the case, the XOR of these three numbers will be zero (since 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0), contributing to one additional win for Bob.

#### Verification with Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases and some additional edge cases.

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 = 3`, so `int(3 == 3) = 1`
   - Total wins for Bob: `0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 = 2`, so `int(2 == 3) = 0`
   - Total wins for Bob: `1 + 0 = 1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `0 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 0`, so `int(0 == 3) = 0`
   - Total wins for Bob: `3 + 0 = 3` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 2`, so `int(2 == 3) = 0`
   - Total wins for Bob: `3 + 0 = 3` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Pairs: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
   - Odd counts: `0 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 = 2`, so `int(2 == 3) = 0`
   - Total wins for Bob: `12 + 0 = 12` (Correct)

6. **Edge Case**: `3 3 3 3`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`
   - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 = 3`, so `int(3 == 3) = 1`
   - Total wins for Bob: `4 + 1 = 5` (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the provided test cases and additional edge cases. The logic of counting pairs and handling the odd counts is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.
