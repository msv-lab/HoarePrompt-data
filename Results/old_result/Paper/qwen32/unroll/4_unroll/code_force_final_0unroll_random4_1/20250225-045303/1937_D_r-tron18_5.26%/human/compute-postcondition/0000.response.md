The code snippet creates a list `pre` that contains the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of the character '>' in the string `s1`. The length of the string `s1` is `n`, and `s1` consists of characters '<' and '>'.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a positive integer such that `len(s1) = n`; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`.**
