The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` will be the integer value read from the input. The precondition for `t` is that it is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. The value of `n` for each of the `t` test cases is still described as an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, but since no input for `n` has been provided yet, `n` remains as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50.**
