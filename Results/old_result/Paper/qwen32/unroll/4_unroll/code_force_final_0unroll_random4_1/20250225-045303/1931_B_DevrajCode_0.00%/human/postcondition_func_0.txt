The function checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in the list `a` among `n` containers such that each container ends up with the same amount of water, which is the average of the total water. It returns 'Yes' if such redistribution is possible without any container having a negative amount of water at any point during the redistribution; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
