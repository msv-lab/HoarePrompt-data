You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the lengths of strings \( a \) and \( b \), followed by the strings themselves.

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes \( k \) to 0 (which represents the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \)) and \( j \) to 0 (which is used to track the current position in string \( b \)).

3. **Subsequence Check**:
   - The program iterates over each character in string \( a \) using a for loop.
   - For each character in \( a \), it uses a while loop to find the first occurrence of that character in string \( b \) starting from the current position \( j \).
   - If the character is found in \( b \), it increments \( k \) (indicating that the current character of \( a \) can be part of the subsequence) and moves \( j \) to the next position in \( b \) to continue the search for the next character of \( a \).
   - If the character is not found in \( b \) (i.e., \( j \) reaches the end of \( b \)), the loop breaks, and the program outputs the current value of \( k \).

4. **Output**: After processing each test case, the program prints the value of \( k \), which is the maximum length of the prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

The program handles all edge cases:
- If \( a \) is completely a subsequence of \( b \), \( k \) will be equal to the length of \( a \).
- If \( a \) has no characters that match any characters in \( b \), \( k \) will remain 0.
- If \( b \) is shorter than \( a \), the program will correctly identify the longest prefix of \( a \) that can be a subsequence of \( b \).

Thus, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
