To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case.

The for loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
For the loop to execute, the `range(1, n)` must generate at least one value. This happens when `n` is greater than 1. Given the problem statement, `n` is already specified to be a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, inclusive. Therefore, `n` already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

The variable `i` in the loop head is the loop variable that will take on values starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be explicitly set because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

The variable `max_item_idx` is not part of the loop head, so it should not be adjusted based on the loop head requirements. However, since it is mentioned in the initial state, we can keep it as is.

Thus, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustment regarding the loop's execution capability, as `n` is already within the valid range for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is 0**
