### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program based on the given problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Recap:
The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
3. Inside `func_1()`:
   - Reads two integers `n` and `k` (where `k` is meant to be `m`).
   - Initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - Calculates `root` as the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1.
   - Iterates from `2` to `root + 1`:
     - For each `i`, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i`.
     - Increments `ans` by the integer division of `(n + i)` by `cnt`.
   - Prints `ans`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function summary describes the logic inside `func_1()` but does not relate it to the problem's requirements. The function calculates a value based on the square root of `n` and some integer divisions, which does not align with the problem's condition involving the gcd and the multiples of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Use of Variables**: The program reads `m` as `k` but does not use it in the calculations.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside `func_1()` does not match the problem's requirements. It does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Lack of Pair Checking**: The program does not check each pair \((a, b)\) to see if it satisfies the given condition.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.
5. Print the count for each test case.

Given the issues in the provided program and the mismatch between its logic and the problem requirements, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
