Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list `p` of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, `p_i` is not equal to `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns the number of cycles in the permutation described by the list `p` for each test case.**
