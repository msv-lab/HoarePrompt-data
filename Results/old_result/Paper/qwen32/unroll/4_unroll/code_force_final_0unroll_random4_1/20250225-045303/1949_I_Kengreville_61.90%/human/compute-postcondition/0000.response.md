Postcondition: **i is an integer representing the index of a disk, x is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the disks, y is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the disks, r is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, visited is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited, nodes is a list that will store the indices of the disks being processed, coef0 and coef1 are lists of coefficients used in the calculations, and n is the total number of disks. The current value of visited[i] is False.**
