The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range it iterates over, which is `int(input())` representing the number of test cases `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `p_i`, `p_j`, `p_k`, and `p_l` (representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` (the number of test cases) is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
