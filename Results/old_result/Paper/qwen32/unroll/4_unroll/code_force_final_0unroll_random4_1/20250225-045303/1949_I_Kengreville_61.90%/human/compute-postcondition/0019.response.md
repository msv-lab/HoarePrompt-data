Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of length `n` from the input. It uses these lists to perform a series of operations involving depth-first search (DFS) to determine if there exists a non-zero sum of coefficients (`c1`). Based on the result, it prints 'YES' if `c1` is non-zero for any DFS traversal, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
