### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment in the context of the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. Thus, after `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` can be any integer between `0` and `n` if `n` is even, or between `1` and `n` if `n` is odd. This is because the parity (odd or even nature) of `m` must match the parity of `n` if it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The program logic is as follows:
1. If `b == c`, it prints "YES", which is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
2. If `b < c`, it prints "NO", which is also correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
3. If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes". This logic is correct because if the number of moves (`b`) and the number of cubes (`c`) have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No", which is correct as well.

The original assessment incorrectly states that the logic `b % 2 == c % 2` is flawed, using the counterexample `1 5 1`. However, this counterexample is incorrect because the logic `b % 2 == c % 2` is indeed correct. Let's break down the counterexample:
- `b = 5` (moves) and `c = 1` (cubes). Both 5 and 1 are odd, so `b % 2 == c % 2` is true. It is possible to end up with 1 cube after 5 moves by adding 1 cube in the first move and then removing 4 cubes in the subsequent moves.

Thus, the original assessment is incorrect, and the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
