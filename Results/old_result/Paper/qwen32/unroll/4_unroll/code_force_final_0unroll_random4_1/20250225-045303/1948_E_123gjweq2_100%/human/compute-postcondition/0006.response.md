The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `not_mid`. If `not_mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, the state of `arr`, `cliquess`, `right`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` is provided. However, only `not_mid` affects whether the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`arr` has elements from index `left + mid - 1` to `left` set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`; `cliquess` has elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` set to `clique`; `right`, `big_element`, `mid` remain unchanged, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
