The code snippet provided initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are modified or assigned new values. The initial state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `data`, and `index`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
