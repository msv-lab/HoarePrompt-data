### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Sum Calculation:
The program calculates the sum of the matrix as follows:
```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```
The expression `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` simplifies to `2i - 1`. Thus, the loop can be rewritten as:
```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (2 * i - 1) * i
```
This loop is intended to calculate the sum of the first `n` triangular numbers, but the formula used does not directly give the maximum sum of the matrix.

The maximum sum of the matrix can indeed be calculated as:
\[ \text{max\_sum} = n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \]
This is because each row can be filled with distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Since there are `n` rows, the total sum is:
\[ n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \]

The provided program's sum calculation is incorrect, as it does not match the derived formula for the maximum sum.

#### Operations:
The program prints `2n` operations as follows:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```
This means that for each row and column from 1 to `n`, it applies the identity permutation (1 to `n`). However, this does not ensure that the matrix is filled with distinct integers in a way that maximizes the sum.

The correct operations should ensure that each row and column contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. A corrected version of the operations would be:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```
This ensures that each row and column is filled with distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not correctly apply the operations to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
