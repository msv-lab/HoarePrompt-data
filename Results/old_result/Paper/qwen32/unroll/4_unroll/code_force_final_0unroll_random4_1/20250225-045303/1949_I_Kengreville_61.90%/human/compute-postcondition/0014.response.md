The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `ok`) and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
