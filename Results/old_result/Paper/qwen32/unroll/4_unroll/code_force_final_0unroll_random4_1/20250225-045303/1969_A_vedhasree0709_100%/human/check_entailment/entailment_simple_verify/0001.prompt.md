You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program in the context of the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come to the party if and only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `l` of best friends.
2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Invitations**:
   - The program initializes indices `i` and `j`.
   - It then iterates through the list of best friends to find pairs of friends who are best friends with each other (i.e., `l[i]` points to `i+1` and `l[l[i]-1]` points back to `i+1`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to indicate that a solution has been found.
   - If no such pair is found after the loop, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Evaluation
- **Case 1**: If there is at least one pair of friends who are best friends with each other, the program correctly identifies this and prints `2` as the minimum number of invitations needed.
- **Case 2**: If there is no such pair, the program prints `3`. However, this is not always correct. Consider a scenario where there is no pair of friends who are best friends with each other, but there is a way to invite two friends such that both come to the party by inviting their respective best friends. For example, if `p = [3, 4, 1, 2]`, inviting friends `1` and `3` will result in friends `1` and `3` coming to the party, but the program will incorrectly print `3`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where there is no direct pair of friends who are best friends with each other but can still invite two friends by inviting their respective best friends. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The program does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly when there is no direct pair of friends who are best friends with each other but can still invite two friends by inviting their respective best friends.
Correctness: **False**
