You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n × n matrix a filled with zeroes. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and the sum of n^2 over all test cases not exceeding 5 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        
        print(sum, n + n)
        
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: After processing all test cases, the program will have printed the results for each test case. Each test case will output the sum calculated in the loop and the value n + n, followed by 2n lines describing specific row operations on an n × n matrix filled with zeroes. The state of the input variable `t` and the loop counter `_` will not be preserved as they are local to the loop. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last test case processed, and the variable `sum` will hold the sum calculated for that last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n × n matrix filled with zeroes. The function processes each test case independently and returns the result for each case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
