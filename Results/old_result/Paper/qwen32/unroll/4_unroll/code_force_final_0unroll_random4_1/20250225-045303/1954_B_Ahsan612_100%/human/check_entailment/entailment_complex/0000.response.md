### Reasoning:

The problem asks us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array, `n`, and the array itself.
3. It then iterates through the array to find the smallest number of consecutive occurrences of any single number.
4. If the smallest number of consecutive occurrences is `inf` (which means there was no change in the array elements, i.e., the array has only one type of number) or if the smallest number of consecutive occurrences is equal to the length of the array (again, meaning the array has only one type of number), it prints `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it prints the smallest number of consecutive occurrences.

This logic is correct because:
- If the array has only one type of number, removing any number of elements will not make it stop being beautiful.
- If there are different numbers in the array with varying consecutive occurrences, the smallest number of consecutive occurrences represents the smallest group that, if removed, will disrupt the ability to make all elements the same using the described operation.
