Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `y` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `r` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `visited` is a list of length `n` with elements as `True` for all indices that were part of any DFS traversal; `coef0` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers assigned based on DFS traversal; `coef1` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers assigned based on DFS traversal; `nodes` is an empty list; `ok` is `True` if at least one DFS traversal resulted in a non-zero `c1`, otherwise `ok` is `False`.**
