The code snippet adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Given that `ans` is initially the set of values resulting from some loop transformations with `0` removed, adding `n` to `ans` will include `n` in the set, assuming it is not already present and is not `0`.

Output State: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_3()`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is the third value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is the set of values resulting from the loop transformations with `0` removed and including `n`.**
