The given code snippet initializes a variable `h` to 0. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `costs` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is [n - k + 1, 1]; `h` is 0.**
