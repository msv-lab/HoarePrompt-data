You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the described algorithm for determining the k-th card Vladislav lays down. Here are a few issues and a counterexample:

1. **List Initialization**: The list `L` is initialized but never populated. The code attempts to iterate over `L` later, but since `L` is empty, the loop will not execute, and no output will be generated.

2. **Logic for Populating L**: The logic for populating `L` (the counts of cards) is missing. The while loop that calculates `m` and decrements `n` does not store any values in `L`.

3. **Printing the Result**: The loop that iterates over `L` is supposed to determine which card is the k-th card, but since `L` is empty, this loop will not execute, and no card will be printed.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
7 1
```
The expected output is `1` because the first card laid down is `1`. However, the provided program will not produce any output because `L` is empty and the loop that prints the result will not execute.

### Correct Implementation Outline:
The correct implementation should:
1. Calculate the number of odd cards and store it in `L`.
2. Calculate the number of cards that are multiples of 2, 4, 6, etc., of odd numbers and store these counts in `L`.
3. Iterate over `L` to determine which card is the k-th card based on the cumulative counts.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        m = (n + 1) // 2  # Number of odd cards
        L.append(m)
        n -= m
        power = 2
        while n > 0:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            L.append(m)
            n -= m
            power += 1
        tot = 0
        power = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(power * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            power += 1

func()
```

This corrected version populates `L` with the counts of cards and then determines the k-th card based on these counts.
