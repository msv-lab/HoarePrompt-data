Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from the input, representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b` respectively.**

Natural Language: The values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the first two integers read from the input, which represent the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b`. The initial state regarding the binary strings `a` and `b` remains unchanged as they have not been assigned any values yet.
