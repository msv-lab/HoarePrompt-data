You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        (x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` processes a disk at index `i` and recursively visits all disks that are touching it and haven't been visited yet. It marks these disks as visited, adds their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with specific calculations based on the radii and positions of the disks.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program contains a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Global Variables**: The `dfs` function uses global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. This can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times or if the global state is not properly initialized or reset. In a more robust implementation, these variables should be passed as arguments to the function or managed within the scope of `func_1`.

2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS (Depth-First Search) logic in the `dfs` function is intended to determine if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. However, the logic does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically:
   - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent. This is correct.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to track the sum of radii, but the logic for updating them and checking if the sum can be decreased is flawed. The logic does not ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.

3. **Output Logic**: The program prints "YES" if `c1 != 0` for any connected component of disks. This logic is not sufficient to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases. The program should ensure that the total sum of radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency, which is not guaranteed by the current logic.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
In this case, the disks are arranged in a line and are tangent to each other. The program should output "NO" because there is no way to adjust the radii such that the sum of radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. However, the provided program will output "YES" because `c1` will not be zero for the connected component of disks.

### Correctness: **False**
