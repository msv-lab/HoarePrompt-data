The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts. The calculated value is determined by adding 1 if all counts of ones, twos, and threes are odd, and then adding half the value of each count (rounded down) to this sum.
