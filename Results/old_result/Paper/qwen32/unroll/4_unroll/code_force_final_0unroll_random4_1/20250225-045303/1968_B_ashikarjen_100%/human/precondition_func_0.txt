The function `func_1` takes no input arguments. The input is provided via standard input (stdin) and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The next two lines contain the binary strings a and b of lengths n and m. The total sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
