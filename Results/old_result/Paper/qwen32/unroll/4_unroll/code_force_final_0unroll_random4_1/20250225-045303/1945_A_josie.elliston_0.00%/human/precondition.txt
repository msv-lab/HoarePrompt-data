The function `f` is incorrectly defined according to the problem description. The correct function definition should include three parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. Each of these parameters should be a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9). Additionally, there is a variable `t` which represents the number of test cases and should be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
