You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.

The loop has finished executing all `a` iterations without any further changes to `t`, `n`, or `grid`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program only checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows (`k[0] == k[1]`) and prints the list `k`. This is insufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. The program does not implement any logic to verify the structure of the shape across all rows.

2. **Output Misalignment**: The program prints the list `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem description.

3. **Incomplete Handling**: The program does not handle cases where the shape is a triangle or a square correctly. It doesn't check for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
2
3
000
011
011
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

For the first test case, the grid is:
```
000
011
011
```
This is a square, but the program will print `[2, 2]` instead of "SQUARE".

For the second test case, the grid is:
```
0000
0000
0100
1110
```
This is a triangle, but the program will print `[1, 3]` instead of "TRIANGLE".

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
- Identify all rows that contain '1's.
- Check if the counts of '1's in these rows form a square or a triangle pattern.
- Print "SQUARE" if the counts form a square pattern.
- Print "TRIANGLE" if the counts form a triangle pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Find the rows with '1's
        ones_counts = [row.count('1') for row in grid if '1' in row]
        
        # Check if it forms a square
        if len(set(ones_counts)) == 1:
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            # Check if it forms a triangle
            k = len(ones_counts)
            is_triangle = True
            for i in range(k):
                if ones_counts[i] != 2 * i + 1:
                    is_triangle = False
                    break
            if is_triangle:
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                # Check for upside-down triangle
                is_upside_down_triangle = True
                for i in range(k):
                    if ones_counts[i] != 2 * (k - i - 1) + 1:
                        is_upside_down_triangle = False
                        break
                if is_upside_down_triangle:
                    print("TRIANGLE")
                else:
                    print("UNKNOWN")  # This line should never be reached as per problem statement

func()
```

This corrected version checks for both triangle and square patterns and prints the correct shape for each test case.
