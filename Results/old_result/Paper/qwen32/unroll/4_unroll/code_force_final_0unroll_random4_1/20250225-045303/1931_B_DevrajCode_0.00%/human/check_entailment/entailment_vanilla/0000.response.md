### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if we can equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from a container to a container with a higher index. The key observation is that for it to be possible to equalize the water in all containers, the cumulative amount of water from the first container to any container should never be less than the target amount of water that each container should have if the water were to be evenly distributed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of this list is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers and the list of water amounts in those containers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. Since the problem guarantees that the sum is divisible by `n`, this check is redundant but does not affect correctness.
   - It calculates the target amount of water each container should have if the water were evenly distributed (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total of the difference between the actual amount of water and the target amount for each container.
   - If at any point the running total becomes negative, it means there is not enough water in the previous containers to meet the target for the current container, and the function returns "No".
   - If the loop completes without the running total ever being negative, it returns "Yes", indicating that it is possible to equalize the water in all containers.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Function Call Error:**
  - The program attempts to call `func_1(n, a)` before the function is defined. This will result in a `NameError` because `func_1` is not defined at the point of the function call.
  - To fix this, the function definition should come before the function call.

- **Input Parsing Error:**
  - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a single list. This means that it does not correctly separate the input for different test cases.
  - The correct approach is to read the number of test cases first, then process each test case individually.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program as written will not function correctly due to the `NameError` and incorrect input parsing. However, if these issues are fixed, the logic for determining whether it is possible to equalize the water in all containers is correct.

**Correctness: False** (due to the issues mentioned above)

If these issues are fixed, the logic is correct, and the answer would be **True**. But as it stands, the program is incorrect.

### Revised Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
