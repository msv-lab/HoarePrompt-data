#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n), n is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of cities in the corresponding sublist of cities, and for each city, the closest city is uniquely determined. The length of cities and n is equal to the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4). The sum of the lengths of all sublists in cities does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, there are m queries (1 <= m <= 10^5), and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n_i; x_i != y_i). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of length `n_i - 1` where each element is either 1 (if the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer). All other variables remain unchanged.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which is a list of length `n_i - 1` where each element is either 1 (if the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `cities`, where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and an integer `n` representing the number of cities in the sublist. It calculates, for each city in the sublist except the last one, whether the forward neighbor is closer or the distance to the forward neighbor if it is not closer. The function returns a list `prog_cities` of length `n - 1` where each element is either 1 (if the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer).
