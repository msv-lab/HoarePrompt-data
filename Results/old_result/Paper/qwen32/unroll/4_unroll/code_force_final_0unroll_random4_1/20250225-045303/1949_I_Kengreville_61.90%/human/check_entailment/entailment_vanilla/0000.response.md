Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if we can adjust the radii of a set of disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The total sum of the radii strictly decreases.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1()`
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of disks `n`.
   - It then reads the coordinates `(x[i], y[i])` and radius `r[i]` for each disk.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `x`, `y`, and `r` are initialized to store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - `visited` is an array used to keep track of visited disks during DFS.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` are arrays used to store coefficients for each disk.
   - `nodes` is a list that will store the nodes (disks) visited during a DFS traversal.

3. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The program iterates through each disk. If a disk has not been visited, it starts a DFS traversal from that disk.
   - During the DFS traversal, it checks if two disks are tangent by verifying if the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii.
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients for the second disk and continues the traversal.

4. **Coefficient Sum Check:**
   - After completing a DFS traversal, it sums the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for all nodes in the current component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is not zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.

5. **Output:**
   - If `ok` is `True`, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to adjust the radii as required.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Function `dfs(i)`
- This function performs a depth-first search starting from disk `i`.
- It marks the current disk as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
- It then iterates through all other disks. If a disk `j` has not been visited and is tangent to disk `i`, it updates the coefficients for disk `j` and recursively calls `dfs(j)`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Global Variables:**
   - The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are not declared as global within `dfs(i)`. This can lead to errors because `dfs(i)` tries to access these variables which are defined in `func_1()`.
   
2. **Coefficient Calculation:**
   - The coefficients `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are calculated based on the assumption that the sum of the radii of two tangent disks can be adjusted in a way that maintains tangency and decreases the total sum. However, the logic for adjusting these coefficients is not clear and does not guarantee that the total sum of the radii will strictly decrease.

3. **Logic for Tangency:**
   - The logic for checking tangency and updating coefficients seems to be based on a specific mathematical approach, but it is not well-explained or justified in the context of the problem. The coefficients are used to determine if a valid adjustment of radii is possible, but the logic is not robust enough to handle all cases.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with the program, particularly the use of global variables and the unclear logic for adjusting the coefficients, it is not guaranteed that the program will correctly determine if the radii can be adjusted as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
