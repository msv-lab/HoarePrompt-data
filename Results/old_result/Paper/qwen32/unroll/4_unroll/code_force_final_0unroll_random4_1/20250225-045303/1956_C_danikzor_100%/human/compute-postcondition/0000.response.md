Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), which represents the size of the n × n matrix a. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged as the input specification and conditions for the test cases are still valid.
