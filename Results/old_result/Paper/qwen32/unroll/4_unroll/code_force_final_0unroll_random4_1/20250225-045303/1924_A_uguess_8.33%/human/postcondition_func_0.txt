The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` distinct combinations of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If it does, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` using the available characters, ensuring the maximum number of distinct combinations are included.
