The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. The string `'NO'` is directly printed without any evaluation or modification based on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, or `ok`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
