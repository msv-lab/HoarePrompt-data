Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of cubes.
     - `f`: Index of the favorite cube.
     - `k`: Number of cubes to be removed.
     - `a`: List of values on the cubes.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, determine if the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

3. **Logic:**
   - Sort the list `a` in non-increasing order.
   - Check if the favorite cube's value is among the first `k` elements in the sorted list.
   - If all occurrences of the favorite value are among the first `k` elements, print "YES".
   - If none of the favorite value is among the first `k` elements, print "NO".
   - Otherwise, print "MAYBE".

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the provided code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        removed_count = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
                removed_count += 1
        
        favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
        
        if removed_count == favorite_count:
            print('YES')
        elif removed_count == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
```

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the values `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a` are read.

2. **Finding the Favorite Value:**
   - The favorite value is correctly identified as `a[f - 1]`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order, stored in `sorted_a`.

4. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The code counts how many times the favorite value appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` (stored in `removed_count`).
   - It also counts the total occurrences of the favorite value in the entire sorted list `sorted_a` (stored in `favorite_count`).

5. **Decision Making:**
   - If `removed_count == favorite_count`, it means all occurrences of the favorite value are among the first `k` elements, so it prints "YES".
   - If `removed_count == 0`, it means none of the favorite value is among the first `k` elements, so it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It checks whether the favorite cube can be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left based on the provided conditions.

**Correctness: True**
