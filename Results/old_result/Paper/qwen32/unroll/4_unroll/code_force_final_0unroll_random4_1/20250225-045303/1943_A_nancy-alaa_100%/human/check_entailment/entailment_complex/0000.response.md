### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game between Alice and Bob is completed. The MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements**: It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Determining MEX**:
   - It iterates through the numbers starting from 0 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - If a number `i` is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., it doesn't appear in the array `a`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once in the array, it sets a flag `first` to `True`. If `first` is already `True` and it encounters another number that appears exactly once, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

The logic here is based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob:
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to include numbers that are not already in `c` or appear exactly once.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to pick numbers that don't affect the MEX calculation until it's forced.

The provided code correctly identifies the smallest integer that is either not present in the array or appears exactly once after the first occurrence of any integer that appears exactly once. This ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly based on the optimal moves of both players.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played optimally by both players. The reasoning and the provided code match the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
