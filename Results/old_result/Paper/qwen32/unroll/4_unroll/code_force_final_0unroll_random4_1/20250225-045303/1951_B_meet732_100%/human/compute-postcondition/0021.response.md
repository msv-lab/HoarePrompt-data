Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. Since `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0, `ind[0] - 1` represents the number of elements before the first element greater than `x`, and `ind[1] - ind[0]` represents the number of elements between the first and second elements greater than `x`.**
