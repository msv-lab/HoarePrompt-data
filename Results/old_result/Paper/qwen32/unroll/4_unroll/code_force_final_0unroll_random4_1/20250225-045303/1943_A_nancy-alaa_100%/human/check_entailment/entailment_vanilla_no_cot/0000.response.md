Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The program's logic for determining the MEX is flawed and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

Here's a brief explanation of the issues:
1. The program attempts to determine the MEX by checking the first non-occurring integer in the array `arr` without simulating the game.
2. It does not take into account that Alice wants to maximize the MEX while Bob wants to minimize it.
3. The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not update the array `c` accordingly.

A correct solution would involve simulating the game turns and keeping track of the elements in `c` to determine the MEX at the end. The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob can be quite complex, but the MEX can be determined by counting the occurrences of each number and considering the parity (odd/even) of the counts to decide which numbers Alice and Bob will pick.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def mex_of_c(n, arr):
    count = Counter(arr)
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if count[i] % 2 == 0:
            mex = i
            break
    return mex

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(mex_of_c(n, arr))

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the MEX by considering the parity of the counts of each number in the array, which indirectly simulates the optimal play of Alice and Bob.
