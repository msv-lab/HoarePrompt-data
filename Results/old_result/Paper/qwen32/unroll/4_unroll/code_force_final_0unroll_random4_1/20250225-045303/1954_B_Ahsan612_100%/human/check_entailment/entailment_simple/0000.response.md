### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1}` equals `a_{i+1}`.

The approach taken by the provided program is to identify the smallest number of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array. If this smallest number is equal to the length of the array or is infinite (which implies there are no changes in the sequence), it means that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements (i.e., all elements are the same or there are no valid operations to change the sequence), and the program should output `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the smallest number of consecutive occurrences, as removing all instances of that number would ensure the array is no longer beautiful.

Let's analyze the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `3`, `2 2 2`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: All elements are the same, so no removal can make it non-beautiful.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 1 2 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing any single `2` will break the sequence, making it non-beautiful.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `1`, `1`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: Only one element, so it's trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removal.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `7`, `3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Removing all `5`s (which occur only once) or any three `3`s will break the sequence, making it non-beautiful.

The program correctly identifies the smallest number of consecutive occurrences of any number and determines if the array can be made non-beautiful based on this value.
