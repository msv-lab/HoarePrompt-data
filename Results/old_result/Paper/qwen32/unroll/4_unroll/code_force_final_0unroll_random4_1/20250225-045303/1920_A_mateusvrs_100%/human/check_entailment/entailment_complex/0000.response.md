### Reasoning:
The program processes each test case by iterating through the constraints and determining the valid range for `k` based on the constraints of type 1 and 2. It then counts how many integers within this range are excluded by constraints of type 3.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cx` is a set that stores the values `k` must not be equal to.
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`), representing the upper bound for `k` (initially, no upper bound is set).
   - `bx` is initialized to a very small number (`-1`), representing the lower bound for `k` (initially, no lower bound is set).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (k must not be equal to x), `x` is added to the set `cx`.
   
3. **Determining Valid Range:**
   - After processing all constraints, if `bx` (the lower bound) is greater than `ax` (the upper bound), it means there are no valid values for `k` that satisfy all constraints, so the result for that test case is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of integers in this range that are in the set `cx` (these are the values `k` must not be equal to).

4. **Output:**
   - The results for all test cases are stored in the list `r`, which is then printed, with each result on a new line.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It correctly handles the constraints of type 1 and 2 to establish the range of `k` and then correctly excludes values specified by constraints of type 3.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
