You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations. The operations involve filling a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - To maximize the sum, we want to place the largest possible numbers in as many cells as possible.
   - The maximum possible number in the matrix is n, and we want each number from 1 to n to appear as many times as possible.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1 Operation**: Fill a row with a permutation.
   - **Type 2 Operation**: Fill a column with a permutation.
   - We have up to 2n operations available.

### Strategy

The optimal strategy is to use Type 1 operations to fill the first n rows with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1] and then use Type 2 operations to fill the first n columns with the same permutation. This way, the diagonal elements will be filled with n, and the off-diagonal elements will be filled with decreasing values.

### Verification

Let's verify the provided program against this strategy:

1. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - The maximum sum for an n x n matrix is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
   - The number of operations is set to 2n.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program performs Type 1 operations on each row from 1 to n, filling each row with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].
   - The program then performs Type 2 operations on each column from 1 to n, filling each column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].

### Example Verification

For n = 2:
- The maximum sum is \( \frac{2(2+1)(4 \cdot 2 - 1)}{6} = 7 \).
- The operations are:
  - Type 1 on row 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 1 on row 2: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 1: [2, 2]
  - Type 2 on column 2: [1, 1]
- The resulting matrix is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The sum is \(2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6\), which is incorrect based on the problem's example. However, the correct operations should be:
  - Type 1 on row 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 1 on row 2: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 2: [1, 2]
- The resulting matrix is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  1 & 2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The sum is \(2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6\), which is incorrect. The correct operations should be:
  - Type 1 on row 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 1 on row 2: [1, 2]
  - Type 2 on column 1: [2, 1]
  - Type 2 on column 2: [1, 2]
- The resulting matrix is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 2 \\
  1 & 2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- The sum is \(2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7\), which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program's logic is flawed because it fills rows and columns with the same permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], which does not maximize the sum correctly. The correct approach should be to fill rows and columns with permutations that maximize the sum, such as [n, n-1, ..., 1] for rows and [1, 2, ..., n] for columns, or vice versa.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
