To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the output. The loop processes each test case independently and prints either `-1` or the minimum value between `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`. The initial state includes the scores of the three players, but these scores do not influence the loop's execution or the output. Therefore, the output state will only reflect the results of the loop's iterations.

Let's break down the steps for each test case:
1. For each test case, read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. Check if the sum `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, print `-1` and move to the next test case.
3. If the sum is even, calculate `x = (a + b + c) // 2` and `y = a + b`.
4. Print the minimum value between `x` and `y`.

Since the loop does not modify the initial state variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, they remain unchanged. The output state will only reflect the printed values for each test case.

Given that the problem asks for the output state in a specific format, and since the output is a series of printed values (one per test case), we can describe the output state as a series of these printed values.

However, the format requests a single output state in the form `Output State: **output state.**`. Since the output is a series of values, we'll represent it as a list of these values.

Here is the format for the output state:

Output State: **[-1, min(x, y), -1, min(x, y), ...]**

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical output. But we can describe the format of the output state as a list of the results for each test case.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume the following test cases:
- Test Case 1: `a=1`, `b=2`, `c=3` (sum is 6, even, x=3, y=3, output is 3)
- Test Case 2: `a=1`, `b=2`, `c=4` (sum is 7, odd, output is -1)
- Test Case 3: `a=2`, `b=2`, `c=2` (sum is 6, even, x=3, y=4, output is 3)

The output state would be:

Output State: **[3, -1, 3]**

However, without specific test cases, we can only describe the format. Therefore, the final answer in the required format is:

Output State: **[output values for each test case]**
