The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer input represents the number of test cases. The initial state mentions that `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing the scores of three players, sorted in non-decreasing order, and `t` is the number of test cases. Since the code only reads the number of test cases, the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `t`, which is assigned the value of the input.

Output State: **Each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases `t` is an input integer.**
