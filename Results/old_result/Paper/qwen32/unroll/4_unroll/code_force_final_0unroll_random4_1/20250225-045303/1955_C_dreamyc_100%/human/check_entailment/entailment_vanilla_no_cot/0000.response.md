Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not accurately simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships and does not properly account for the durability reduction and sinking of ships.

The program attempts to use a prefix sum approach to determine how many ships are sunk after `k` attacks, but it does not correctly handle the alternating attack pattern and the sinking of ships. Specifically, the program does not dynamically adjust the list of ships as ships sink, and it does not correctly calculate the number of attacks on the first and last ships.

To fix the program, one would need to simulate the attacks in a loop, reducing the durability of the first and last ships alternately and removing ships from the list when they sink. This would require a more detailed and accurate simulation of the attack process.
