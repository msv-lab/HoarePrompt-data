To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem requirements and check the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis:
- Nikita can perform two types of moves: add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- The goal is to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because Nikita can't add more than `n` cubes.
- If `n` is equal to `m`, it is possible if all moves are adding cubes.
- If `n` is greater than `m`, it is possible if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because:
  - Each pair of "add" and "remove" operations cancels out.
  - Thus, to end up with `m` cubes, the number of "add" operations must be `m + k` and "remove" operations must be `k`, where `k` is any non-negative integer.
  - The total number of operations is `m + k + k = m + 2k`, which is always even if `n - m` is even.

### Code Analysis:
Let's look at the logic in the provided code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
- The code correctly handles the case where `b == c` by printing "YES".
- If `b < c`, the code correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- For the case `b > c`, the code checks if `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is correct because, as explained above, the difference `b - c` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
