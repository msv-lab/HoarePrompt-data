You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it calculates a specific value `ans` based on the input `n` and prints this value. The calculation involves iterating up to the square root of `n` and adjusting `ans` by adding the integer division of `n + i` by `i * i` for each `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem requirements:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) according to the problem statement).
3. The program then calculates `ans` as `n` and iterates over a range up to the square root of `n`, adding values to `ans` based on a specific formula.

The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem requirements. Specifically:
- The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) and verifying if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The provided code does not iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and does not compute the gcd or check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

Here is a counterexample to show the program's incorrectness:

Input:
```
1
2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```
Explanation:
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). 2 is a multiple of 1.
- For \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). 3 is a multiple of 1.
- For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\). 4 is a multiple of 2.

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output for this input.

Thus, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem requirements.
