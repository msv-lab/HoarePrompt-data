### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Nikita can perform `n` moves, each move being either adding one cube or removing one cube.
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Key Observations:**
- If `n` is equal to `m`, it's clearly possible to build the tower by adding one cube in each of the `n` moves.
- If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `n` is greater than `m`, we need to consider the parity (even or odd nature) of `n` and `m`:
  - If `n` and `m` have the same parity, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes. This is because we can add cubes until we reach a point where we need to start removing cubes to reach `m`. Since both `n` and `m` have the same parity, the difference `n - m` is even, meaning we can perform an even number of removals (which is possible since we can always balance adding and removing an equal number of times).
  - If `n` and `m` have different parities, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes because the difference `n - m` is odd, and we can't balance an odd number of removals with an even number of additions (or vice versa).

**Code Analysis:**
- The code correctly handles the first two cases:
  - If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (number of cubes), it prints 'YES'.
  - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
- The third case is correctly handled by checking if `b` and `c` have the same parity (`b % 2 == c % 2`). If they do, it prints 'YES'.
- The fourth case is correctly handled by the `else` statement, which prints 'NO' if the parities are different.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the observations above. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
