The function `dfs` processes a disk at index `i` and recursively visits all disks that are touching it and haven't been visited yet. It marks these disks as visited, adds their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with specific calculations based on the radii and positions of the disks.
