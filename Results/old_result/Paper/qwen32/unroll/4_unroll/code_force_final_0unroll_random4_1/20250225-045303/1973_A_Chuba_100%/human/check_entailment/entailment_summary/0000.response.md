### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three players based on their final scores. The program processes multiple test cases, each with three scores that are guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The key logic in the program is as follows:
1. **Odd Sum Check**: If the sum of the three scores is odd, the program outputs `-1` because the total points awarded in any game (either 2 points for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 point each for a draw) must always be even.
2. **Draw Calculation**: If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula: `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   
Let's analyze the formula:
- `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total points awarded.
- `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` adjusts for the scenario where one player has significantly more points than the other two combined, which would otherwise lead to an incorrect draw count.
- The division by 2 accounts for the fact that each draw contributes 2 points to the total.

### Verification with Examples:
1. **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Sum is 0 (even).
   - No games were played, so no draws.
   - The formula results in `0`, which is correct.

2. **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Sum is 2 (even).
   - One draw between the second and third players.
   - The formula results in `1`, which is correct.

3. **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Sum is 3 (odd).
   - No valid combination of games can result in these scores.
   - The program outputs `-1`, which is correct.

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Sum is 4 (even).
   - Two draws (one between the first and second players, and one between the second and third players).
   - The formula results in `2`, which is correct.

5. **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Sum is 9 (odd).
   - No valid combination of games can result in these scores.
   - The program outputs `-1`, which is correct.

6. **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Six draws (complex scenario, but the formula accounts for it correctly).
   - The formula results in `6`, which is correct.

7. **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Two draws (complex scenario, but the formula accounts for it correctly).
   - The formula results in `2`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify invalid score combinations.

### Correctness: **True**
