To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total: \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.

### Key Observations

1. **Minimum Cells for \( k \) Diagonals:**
   - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color one cell.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can cover \( k \) diagonals with \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) cells. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left).
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need more cells. Specifically, we can cover \( 2n \) diagonals with \( n \) cells (one cell per diagonal in either direction). For the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals, we need additional cells. Each additional cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, so we need \( \lceil \frac{k - 2n}{2} \rceil \) more cells. However, since we already used \( n \) cells, the total number of cells needed is \( n + \lceil \frac{k - 2n}{2} \rceil \), which simplifies to \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) when \( k > 2n \).

2. **Simplification:**
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) works.
   - For \( k > 2n \), the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) also works because \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \geq n + \lceil \frac{k - 2n}{2} \rceil \).

### Program Logic

The program uses the following logic:
- If \( k = 1 \), it prints 1.
- If \( k \leq 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- If \( k > 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

This logic is consistent with the observations above.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)**
   - \( k \leq 2n \) (4 <= 6).
   - \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
   - Correct output: 2.

2. **Second Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)**
   - \( k \leq 2n \) (3 <= 6).
   - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
   - Correct output: 2.

3. **Third Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)**
   - \( k > 2n \) (10 > 6).
   - \( \lceil \frac{10}{2} \rceil = 5 \).
   - However, we need to cover 10 diagonals, and the correct minimum number of cells is 6 (as shown in the example).
   - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) does not work for this case.

4. **Fourth Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)**
   - \( k > 2n \) (9 > 6).
   - \( \lceil \frac{9}{2} \rceil = 5 \).
   - However, we need to cover 9 diagonals, and the correct minimum number of cells is 5 (as shown in the example).
   - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) works for this case.

5. **Fifth Test Case: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)**
   - \( k \leq 2n \) (7 <= 8).
   - \( \lceil \frac{7}{2} \rceil = 4 \).
   - Correct output: 4.

6. **Sixth Test Case: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)**
   - \( k \leq 2n \) (11 <= 14).
   - \( \lceil \frac{11}{2} \rceil = 6 \).
   - Correct output: 6.

7. **Seventh Test Case: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)**
   - \( k > 2n \) (3 > 4).
   - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
   - However, we need to cover 3 diagonals, and the correct minimum number of cells is 2 (as shown in the example).
   - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) works for this case.

### Conclusion

The program logic is incorrect for some cases where \( k > 2n \). Specifically, the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) does not always yield the correct minimum number of cells required to cover \( k \) diagonals when \( k > 2n \).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
