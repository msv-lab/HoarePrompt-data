The code snippet calculates the sum of the list `elements` and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and the condition `either removals is not equal to 6 or negatives is not equal to 3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of `elements`, and either `removals` is not equal to 6 or `negatives` is not equal to 3.**
