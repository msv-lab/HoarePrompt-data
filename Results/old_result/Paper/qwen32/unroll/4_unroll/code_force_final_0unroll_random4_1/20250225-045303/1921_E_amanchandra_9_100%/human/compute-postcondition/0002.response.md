To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the state based on the input values. The loop processes each test case independently, and the output for each test case is printed directly without modifying any global state variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged after the loop completes.

The loop reads six integers for each of the `t` test cases and prints the result of the comparison between Alice and Bob based on the given conditions. Since the loop does not modify the initial state variables, the output state will be the same as the initial state except for the printed outputs for each test case, which are not part of the state variables.

Thus, the output state will be the same as the initial state in terms of the variables provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= `h` <= 10^6 and 1 <= `w` <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; It is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`. The sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
