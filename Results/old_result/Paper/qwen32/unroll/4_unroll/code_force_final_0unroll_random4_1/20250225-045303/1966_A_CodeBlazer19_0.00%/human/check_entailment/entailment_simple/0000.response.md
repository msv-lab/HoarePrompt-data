Reasoning:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic of the code is to read the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cards) and `k` (the number of cards to exchange), and then it reads the list of card numbers. Instead of calculating the minimum number of cards that can be left, the code simply prints `k - 1` for each test case. This approach is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left depends on the frequency of each card and the value of `k`.

To correctly solve the problem, one should:
1. Count the frequency of each card.
2. For each unique card, determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed and how many cards will be left over.
3. Sum the leftover cards for all unique cards to get the minimum number of cards that can be left.

Given that the code does not implement this logic, it will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
