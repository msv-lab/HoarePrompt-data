You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` cows, each with a distinct Cowdeforces rating.
- Cows participate in a single-elimination tournament with `n-1` matches.
- The cow with a higher rating wins each match and advances.
- We want to maximize the number of matches won by cow `k` by performing at most one swap.
- We need to determine the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two main parts:
1. The main loop that processes each test case.
2. The function `func_1(a)` which calculates the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.

Let's break down the function `func_1(a)`:
- It first identifies the rating of cow `k` and stores it in `x`.
- It then iterates through the list `a` to find the indices of the first two cows with ratings higher than `x`.
- Depending on the positions of these cows, it calculates the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variable `n`**:
   - The variable `n` is used inside `func_1(a)` but is not passed as an argument. This means `n` should be a global variable, which is not defined in the function. This will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Wins**:
   - The logic for calculating the maximum wins is flawed. The function does not correctly account for the possibility of swapping cow `k` with another cow to maximize wins.
   - The function does not consider the scenario where cow `k` can be swapped with a cow that has a lower rating but can potentially allow cow `k` to win more matches by changing the sequence of matches.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of wins cow `k` can achieve without any swap.
2. Consider the possibility of swapping cow `k` with each other cow and calculate the number of wins in each case.
3. Choose the swap that maximizes the number of wins for cow `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
