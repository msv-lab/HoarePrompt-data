You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints a specific value based on predefined conditions or calculates the count of zeros in the list `a` after performing decrement operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program seems to handle some specific test cases by hardcoding the expected outputs. However, this approach does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs. Let's analyze why this is the case:

1. **Hardcoded Outputs**: The program includes numerous hardcoded conditions (`if k == 1999999998`, `elif k == 1999999999`, etc.). These hardcoded conditions are not based on any logical computation but rather specific test cases. This approach is not scalable and does not handle all potential inputs.

2. **Logic for General Cases**: The program includes a general loop to handle attacks, but it does not account for all edge cases. For example, if `k` is very large compared to the sum of the durabilities of the ships, the program should correctly identify that all ships will sink. However, the hardcoded conditions might override this logic, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as:
   - When `n == 1` and `k` is greater than `a[0]`.
   - When `k` is exactly equal to the sum of the durabilities of the ships.
   - When `k` is less than the sum of the durabilities of the ships but more than twice the number of ships.

4. **Efficiency**: The program uses a loop to simulate each attack, which can be inefficient for large values of `k` (up to \(10^{15}\)). A more efficient approach would involve calculating the number of attacks needed to sink each ship and using that to determine the total number of sunk ships.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 6
2 1 2
```
The Kraken's attacks would proceed as follows:
1. Attack the first ship: `a = [1, 1, 2]`
2. Attack the last ship: `a = [1, 1, 1]`
3. Attack the first ship: `a = [0, 1, 1]`
4. Attack the last ship: `a = [0, 1, 0]`
5. Attack the first ship (no effect since it's already sunk): `a = [0, 1, 0]`
6. Attack the last ship (no effect since it's already sunk): `a = [0, 1, 0]`

In this case, only 2 ships are sunk. However, the program might not handle this correctly due to the hardcoded conditions or the loop logic.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it relies on hardcoded conditions and does not handle all potential cases correctly. A more robust and efficient solution is needed to ensure correctness for all inputs.
