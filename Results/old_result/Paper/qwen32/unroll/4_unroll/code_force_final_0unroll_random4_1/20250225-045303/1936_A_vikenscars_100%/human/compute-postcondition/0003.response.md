The value of `pair_idx` is assigned the value of `max_item_idx`. Since `max_item_idx` is `n-1`, `pair_idx` will also be `n-1`. The value of `n` remains a positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is n-1; `pair_idx` is n-1**.
