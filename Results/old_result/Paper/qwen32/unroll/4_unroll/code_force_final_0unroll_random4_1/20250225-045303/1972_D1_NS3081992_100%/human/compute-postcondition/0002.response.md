Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1; `ans` is 0.**

In this output state, the variables `n` and `m` retain their initial values as positive integers within the specified range, `i` remains 1, and a new variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
