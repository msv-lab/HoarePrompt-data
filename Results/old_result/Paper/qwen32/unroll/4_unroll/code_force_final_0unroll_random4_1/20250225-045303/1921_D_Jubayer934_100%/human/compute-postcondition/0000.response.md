The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a throwaway variable for iteration. The loop will execute based on the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided to the program will result in a positive integer for the number of iterations.

Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`, which means there will be at least one test case and at most 100 test cases. This directly implies that `int(input())` will be a positive integer, and thus the loop will execute.

Since `t` is the number of test cases and it is already guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, we do not need to adjust any other variables in the loop head. The state of `t` is sufficient to ensure that the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
