The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `n` and `k` does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes `n` and `k` as positive integers with the conditions \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), \(n \neq k\), and \(n < k\).
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` and `k`, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
