Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) is still valid. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the list `a` contains 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.**
