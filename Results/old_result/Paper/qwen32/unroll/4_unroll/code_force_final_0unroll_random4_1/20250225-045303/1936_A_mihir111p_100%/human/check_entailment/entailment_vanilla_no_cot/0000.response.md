Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Strategy for Finding the Maximum XOR**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum value `ans1` by comparing the bitwise OR of each element with itself (`func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`). This comparison is always `=` because `p_i | p_i` is always `p_i`. This does not help in finding the maximum value in the permutation.
   - Similarly, the program uses `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)` to find the maximum value `mx` that gives the highest OR value when combined with `ans1`. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly leverage the OR operation to identify the largest numbers in the permutation.

2. **Incorrect Use of Equal Values**:
   - The program collects all indices `v` where `p_i | p_ans1` equals `p_mx | p_ans1`. However, this does not necessarily mean that these indices will yield the maximum XOR value when compared pairwise.

3. **Incorrect Final XOR Comparison**:
   - The final loop where the program compares `p_ans | p_ans` with `p_v[i] | p_v[i]` is incorrect. The goal is to find the maximum XOR between any two numbers, not the maximum OR between the same number.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should focus on finding the two largest numbers in the permutation, as the XOR of two large numbers is likely to be the maximum. This can be achieved by using the OR operation to identify the largest numbers and then comparing them to find the maximum XOR value.

Here's a revised approach:

1. **Find the largest number** in the permutation by comparing the OR of each number with the current largest number.
2. **Find the second largest number** that maximizes the XOR with the largest number by comparing the OR of each number with the largest number.
3. **Calculate the XOR** of the two largest numbers found and output them as the result.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the pair of indices that yield the maximum XOR value using the allowed number of queries.
