Functionality: **The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It adjusts `k` by subtracting the difference between `m` and each element of `a` that is less than `m`, up to the first `n` elements. It returns `1` if `k` is non-negative after these adjustments, otherwise it returns `-1`.**
