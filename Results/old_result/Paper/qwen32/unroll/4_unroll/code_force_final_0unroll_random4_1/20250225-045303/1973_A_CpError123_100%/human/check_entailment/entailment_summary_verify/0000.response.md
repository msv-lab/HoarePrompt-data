### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the scores for each test case.
   - The scores are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order (`p1 <= p2 <= p3`).

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - The program should output the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.
   - The sum of the scores must be even because each game contributes an even number of points.

3. **Logic for Maximum Draws**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it outputs `-1`, which is correct.
   - If the sum is even, it calculates `x = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`, which represents the total number of games played.
   - It calculates `y = p1 + p2`, which represents the sum of the scores of the two players with the lower scores.
   - The program then outputs `min(x, y)`, which is the maximum number of draws possible.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
     - Sum is `0` (even), `x = 0`, `y = 0`, output: `0` (correct).
   - **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
     - Sum is `2` (even), `x = 1`, `y = 1`, output: `1` (correct).
   - **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
     - Sum is `3` (odd), output: `-1` (correct).
   - **Example 4**: `3 4 5`
     - Sum is `12` (even), `x = 6`, `y = 4`, output: `4` (incorrect, should be `6`).
   - **Example 5**: `1 1 10`
     - Sum is `12` (even), `x = 6`, `y = 2`, output: `2` (correct).

5. **Detailed Analysis of Example 4**:
   - For `3 4 5`, the sum is `12` (even).
   - The total number of games played is `x = 12 // 2 = 6`.
   - The sum of the scores of the two players with the lower scores is `y = 3 + 4 = 7`.
   - The program outputs `min(6, 7) = 6`, which is correct. However, the original assessment mentioned it should return `4`, which is incorrect.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem description and the edge cases mentioned.
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is correct, and the program outputs the correct results for all valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is mostly accurate, but there was a mistake in the analysis of Example 4. The program is indeed correct based on the provided logic and the problem description.

Final: **True**
