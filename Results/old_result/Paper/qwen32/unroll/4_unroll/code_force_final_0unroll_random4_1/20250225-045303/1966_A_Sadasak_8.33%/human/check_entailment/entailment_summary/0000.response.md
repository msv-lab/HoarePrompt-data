Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. However, the logic implemented in the program is not correct and does not follow the problem's requirements.

Let's break down the issues:

1. The `func_1` function is supposed to help determine the minimum number of cards left, but it only counts the occurrences of each card up to `k`. This is not sufficient to determine the optimal sequence of operations to minimize the number of cards.

2. The main logic in the program is flawed:
   - If `k > n`, it correctly returns `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k == n`, it correctly returns `k - 1` because all cards can be exchanged for `k - 1` cards.
   - For other cases, it incorrectly checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table returned by `func_1`. This check does not determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

3. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally. This involves using a strategy to reduce the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` cards with `k-1` cards. The program does not implement this strategy.

4. The correct approach involves calculating the remainder of the count of each card type when divided by `k` (except for the case where the count is exactly `k`, which can be reduced to `k-1`). The sum of these remainders gives the minimum number of cards left.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
