The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. After executing this code, the value of `t` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input, but it will still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. The other variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
