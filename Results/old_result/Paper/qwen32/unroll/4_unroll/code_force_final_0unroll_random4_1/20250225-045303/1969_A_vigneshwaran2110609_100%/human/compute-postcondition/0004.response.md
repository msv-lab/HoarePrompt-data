Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks a specific condition related to the permutation described by `p` and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether the condition is met. Specifically, it prints `2` if there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`; otherwise, it prints `3`.**
