The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `times`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= `a_j` < 2^31 for each test case; `times` is the input integer representing the number of test cases.**
