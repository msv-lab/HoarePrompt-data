You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints "YES" and additional information if it's possible to make `n` equal to `k` through a series of operations, otherwise it prints "NO". The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to set up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using at most `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, meaning she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then proceeds to the next stall.

**Key Points:**
1. Alice buys greedily, so the prices must be set such that she buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. The number of stalls can be at most 60.
3. The price per jewel in each stall is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

### Program Analysis

The provided program seems to have a few issues based on the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls and what the prices should be.
   - The function starts by checking if `n` equals `k`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correct.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO", which is also correct.
   - The function then initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and adjusts `n` and `h` accordingly.
   - If `h` (total jewels bought) is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the prices.

2. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The logic for setting up the stalls and prices is not correct. The program only uses two stalls and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of using up to 60 stalls with different prices to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not handle all cases correctly, especially when `k` is large or when `n` is not enough to buy `k` jewels at a single price.

### Correct Solution Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can set up to 60 stalls with appropriate prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One way to achieve this is by using a binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and their prices.

For example, if `k` is 8, we can use the binary representation `1000` (which is 2^3) and set up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels. Specifically, we can set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) and ensure that the sum of the jewels bought from these stalls equals `k`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
