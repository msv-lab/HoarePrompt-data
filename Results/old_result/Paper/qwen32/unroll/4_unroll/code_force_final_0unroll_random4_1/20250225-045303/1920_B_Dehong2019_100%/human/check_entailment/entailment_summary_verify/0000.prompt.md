You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    2 2 1
    
    4 3
    
    2 1 2
    
    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of the array `a` after performing specific operations involving `k` and `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Let's break down why the code is incorrect by examining the logic and a specific test case.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Alice's Strategy**: The code does not correctly handle the optimal removal of elements by Alice. It simply removes the largest elements in the sorted array without considering the impact on Bob's subsequent moves.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: The code does not correctly handle the optimal flipping of elements by Bob. It assumes that flipping the largest remaining elements is always optimal, which may not be the case.

### Specific Test Case:
Let's consider a test case where the code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 2
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-15
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Alice can remove up to 2 elements. Removing the two largest elements (which are -1 and -2) leaves the array as `[-3, -4, -5]`.
- Bob can flip up to 2 elements. Flipping the two largest elements (which are -3 and -4) results in the array `[3, 4, -5]`.
- The sum of the array is `3 + 4 - 5 = 2`.

However, the optimal strategy is:
- Alice should remove the two smallest elements (which are -4 and -5) leaving the array as `[-1, -2, -3]`.
- Bob should flip the two smallest elements (which are -1 and -2) resulting in the array `[1, 2, -3]`.
- The sum of the array is `1 + 2 - 3 = 0`.

But the code will not achieve this optimal strategy.

### Code Behavior with the Test Case:
- The code will sort the array in descending order: `[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]`.
- It will then remove the two largest elements (which are -1 and -2) leaving the array as `[-3, -4, -5]`.
- It will then flip the two largest elements (which are -3 and -4) resulting in the array `[3, 4, -5]`.
- The sum of the array is `3 + 4 - 5 = 2`.

However, the code does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players, as seen in the above example.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
