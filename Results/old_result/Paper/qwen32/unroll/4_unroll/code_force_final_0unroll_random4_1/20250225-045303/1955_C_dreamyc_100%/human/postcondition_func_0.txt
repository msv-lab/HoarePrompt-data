The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of integers in the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers). It returns the integer `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the count of iterations where the cumulative sum from the start or the end of the list `nums` is less than or equal to `k // 2` and `math.ceil(k / 2)` respectively.
