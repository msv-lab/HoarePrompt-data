### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Bob's Objective**: Bob can repaint at most `k` parts of the ribbon to make all parts the same color.
2. **Alice's Objective**: Alice wants to paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot achieve his objective.

#### Conditions for Bob to Achieve His Objective:
- If Alice uses a single color for more than `n - k` parts, Bob can repaint the remaining parts to make all parts the same color.
- To prevent this, Alice must ensure that no single color is used more than `n - k` times.

#### Mathematical Insight:
- The maximum number of parts that can be painted with a single color without violating the condition is `math.ceil(n / m)`.
- If `math.ceil(n / m) <= n - k`, Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no color is used more than `n - k` times, and Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

#### Program Analysis:
The program checks the following conditions:
1. `n <= k`: If true, it prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint all parts to the same color.
2. `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: If true, it prints 'NO' because it means that even with the most balanced distribution of colors, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
3. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', meaning Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call**: The input consists of an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- **State Inside Loop**:
  - `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())`: Reads the values for `n`, `m`, and `k`.
  - `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: Checks the conditions derived from the problem analysis.
  - `print('NO')` or `print('YES')`: Prints the result based on the conditions.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for Alice to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. The program accurately checks these conditions and provides the correct output for each test case.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
