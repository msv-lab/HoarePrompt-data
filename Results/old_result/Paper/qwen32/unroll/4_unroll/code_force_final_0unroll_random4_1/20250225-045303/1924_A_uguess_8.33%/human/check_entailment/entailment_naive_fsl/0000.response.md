Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Counting Full Sets of Characters**:
   - The code uses a bitmask `cur` to keep track of the characters seen so far. When `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence.
   - The variable `cnt` is incremented each time a full set of `k` characters is seen, but it does not ensure that all possible permutations of length `n` have been seen as subsequences.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**:
   - When the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it attempts to generate a missing subsequence.
   - The logic for generating the missing subsequence is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the remaining characters in `cur` can be used to form a valid missing subsequence.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3 6
abcabc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
ab
```

**Explanation:**
- The string `s` is `abcabc`.
- All possible strings of length `2` using `a`, `b`, and `c` are: `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`.
- The string `s` does not contain the subsequences `aa`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc` as complete subsequences.
- The program should output `NO` and any one of the missing subsequences, such as `aa`.

**Actual Output:**
The provided program will likely output `YES` because it only checks if all characters have been seen at least once in the string, not if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` and generate a correct missing subsequence when necessary. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
