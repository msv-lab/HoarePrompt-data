Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `s` is the input string provided by the user.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`. This means `s[0]` is the same as `s[1]`, `s[2]`, ..., `s[x-1]`, but `s[x]` is different from `s[0]`.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`. However, the result of `func_1` is not directly relevant to the print statement, so we can ignore it for determining the print output.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
```

### Explanation:
- `s[:x + 1]` will print the substring of `s` starting from the beginning up to and including the character at index `x`. This substring consists of the repeated characters of `s[0]` up to the point where the first different character is found.
- `s[x + 1:]` will print the substring of `s` starting from the character right after the first different character (i.e., `s[x + 1]`) to the end of the string.

### Output:
The output will be the concatenation of the substring from the start of `s` to the first different character (inclusive), a space, and the substring from the character right after the first different character to the end of the string.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:] (where s[:x + 1] is the substring from the start of s to the first character different from s[0] inclusive, and s[x + 1:] is the substring from the character right after the first different character to the end of the string)**

To make it more concrete, let's assume an example:
- Suppose `s = "aaaabbb"`, then `x = 3` because `s[3]` is the first character different from `s[0]`.
- `s[:x + 1]` would be `"aaaa"`.
- `s[x + 1:]` would be `"bbb"`.

Output: **aaaa bbb**
