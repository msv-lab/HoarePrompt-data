Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not always find the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to come to the party. The program only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and immediately returns 2 if such a pair exists. However, there could be cases where the minimum number of invitations is 3 or more.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
2 3 4 5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In this case, no two friends are each other's best friends (i.e., no friend `i` has `p_i = i`). Therefore, the program will not find any such pair and will incorrectly assume that it needs to send 3 invitations. However, the correct answer is 3 because Monocarp can invite friends 1, 2, and 3. This will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party (since 1's best friend is 2 and 2's best friend is 3, and both 1 and 2 are invited).

Thus, the program fails to handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
