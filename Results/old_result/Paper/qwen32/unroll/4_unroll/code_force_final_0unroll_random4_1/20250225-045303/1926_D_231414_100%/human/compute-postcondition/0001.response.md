The code snippet assigns the value `2 ** 31 - 1` to the variable `check`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `times`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the assignment of `check`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= `a_j` < 2^31 for each test case; `times` is the input integer representing the number of test cases; `check` is 2147483647.**
