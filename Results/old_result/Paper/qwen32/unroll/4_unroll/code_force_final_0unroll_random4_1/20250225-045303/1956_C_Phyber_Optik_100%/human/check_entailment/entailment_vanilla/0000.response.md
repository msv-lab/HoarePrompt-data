Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using at most `2n` operations. Two types of operations are allowed:
1. Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Assign a permutation to a column.

The maximum possible sum of the matrix can be achieved by ensuring that each number from 1 to n appears exactly n times in the matrix (once in each row and once in each column, forming a Latin square). The sum of all elements in such a matrix is the sum of the first `n` squares, which is `1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2`.

### Solution Analysis

Let's break down the provided solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program initializes the sum to 1.
   - It then calculates the sum of squares from 1 to n using the formula: `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - This is a correct way to compute the sum of squares: `1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2`.

3. **Outputting the Number of Operations:**
   - The program outputs `2n` as the number of operations, which is within the allowed limit.

4. **Generating Operations:**
   - For each row `j` from 1 to `n`, the program performs two operations:
     - Type 1 operation: Assign the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to the row `n - j + 1`.
     - Type 2 operation: Assign the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to the column `n - j + 1`.
   
   - This strategy ensures that each number from 1 to n appears exactly n times in the matrix, forming a Latin square.

### Correctness of the Solution

The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and generates a sequence of operations that achieves this sum using at most `2n` operations. The operations described in the solution ensure that each number from 1 to n appears exactly n times in the matrix, which is the optimal configuration to maximize the sum.

Thus, the solution is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
