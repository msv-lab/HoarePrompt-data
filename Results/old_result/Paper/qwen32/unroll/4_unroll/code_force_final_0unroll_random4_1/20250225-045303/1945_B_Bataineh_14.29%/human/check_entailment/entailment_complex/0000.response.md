Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code does not account for the correct calculation of the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

Let's analyze the problem again:

The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any point in time. This involves considering the overlap of intervals during which fireworks are visible. Each firework from the first installation is visible for `m+1` minutes starting from its launch time, and similarly, each firework from the second installation is visible for `m+1` minutes starting from its launch time.

The code provided has two main issues:
1. It does not correctly calculate the overlap of the intervals.
2. The logic `if m < a or m < b: print(2)` is incorrect. It assumes that if `m` is less than `a` or `b`, the maximum number of fireworks seen at the same time is 2, which is not necessarily true.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find out the periodicity of the overlapping intervals. We then need to calculate how many fireworks from each installation are visible at any given time within one LCM period and find the maximum number of visible fireworks during that period.

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determining the number of fireworks visible from each installation within one LCM period.
3. Checking the visibility intervals within one LCM period to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Given the code's logic, it is clear that it does not implement this approach and thus does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
