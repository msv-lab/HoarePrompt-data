You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = input().split()
    for i in range(n):
        cities[i] = int(cities[i])
    forward_cities = func_1(cities, n)

        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of lists `cities`, where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and an integer `n` representing the number of cities in the sublist. It calculates, for each city in the sublist except the last one, whether the forward neighbor is closer or the distance to the forward neighbor if it is not closer. The function returns a list `prog_cities` of length `n - 1` where each element is either 1 (if the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - The number of cities `n`.
     - The positions of the cities `cities`.
     - The number of queries `m`.
     - The queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to determine the closest city for each city in the given list.
   - `func_1` iterates through the list of cities and calculates the distance to the previous and next city.
   - It sets the value in `prog_cities` to `1` if the closest city is the next city, otherwise it sets the value to the distance to the next city.
   - This function is called twice: once for the original list of cities (`forward_cities`) and once for the reversed list of cities (`backward_cities`).

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward closest city distances.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative distance when traveling forward using the closest city.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative distance when traveling backward using the closest city.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums based on the order of the cities in the query.
   - It calculates the cost of traveling between the cities using the prefix sums.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Closest City Calculation**:
   - The closest city for each city should be uniquely determined as either the previous or the next city, with the condition that the distance to this city is strictly less than the distance to any other city.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` sets the value to `1` if the next city is closer, otherwise it sets the value to the distance to the next city. This is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case where the previous city might be closer.
   - The correct implementation should compare the distances to both the previous and next cities and set the value accordingly.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect closest city distances. This means the prefix sums will not correctly represent the minimum cost to travel between cities using the closest city strategy.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly uses the prefix sums to calculate the cost of traveling between cities based on the order of the cities in the query.
   - However, since the prefix sums are incorrect, the calculated costs will also be incorrect.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified in the closest city calculation and the subsequent prefix sum calculation, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
