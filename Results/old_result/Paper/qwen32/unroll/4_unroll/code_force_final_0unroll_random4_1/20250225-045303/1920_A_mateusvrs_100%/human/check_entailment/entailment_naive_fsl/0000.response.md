Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x). Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of valid integers k by not properly considering the exclusion of values that are both within the range defined by constraints of type 1 and 2 and also excluded by constraints of type 3.

Here's a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 4
3 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- k must be greater than or equal to 3 (constraint 1).
- k must be less than or equal to 10 (constraint 2).
- k must be not equal to 4 (constraint 3).
- k must be not equal to 7 (constraint 4).

The valid values for k are: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. So the answer is 6.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
The program incorrectly counts the number of valid integers k. Here's the breakdown of the program's logic:
- It sets `bx` to the maximum value of constraints of type 1 (which is 3).
- It sets `ax` to the minimum value of constraints of type 2 (which is 10).
- It adds all values of constraints of type 3 to a set `cx` (which contains {4, 7}).
- It then calculates the number of valid k values as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

In this case, `tmp` is 2 (since both 4 and 7 are within the range [3, 10]). So the program calculates the number of valid k values as `10 - 3 + 1 - 2 = 6`, but it incorrectly outputs 5.

The issue arises because the program does not correctly account for the exclusion of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`. The problem is in the logic that calculates `tmp` and how it is subtracted from the total range.

To fix this, the program should correctly count the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx`. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
