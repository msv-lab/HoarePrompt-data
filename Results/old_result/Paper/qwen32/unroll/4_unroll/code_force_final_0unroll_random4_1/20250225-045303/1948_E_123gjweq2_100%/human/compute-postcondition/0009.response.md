Functionality: **The function `make_array` modifies the array `arr` by assigning specific values to elements in the range from index `left` to `right` (inclusive). It sets the first half of this range to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. Additionally, it assigns the value of `clique` to each element in the `cliquess` array within the same range.**
