To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the given code step by step.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Logic**:
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the list, and `minn` to positive infinity (`inf`).
   - It then iterates through the list starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and moves `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array `ar`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Output State:
- The output for each test case is either `-1` or the smallest number of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are modified during each iteration of the loop.
- The final output state is a series of outputs (one for each test case), which are printed to the console.

### Output State Format:
Since the output is a series of printed values (one per test case), we need to describe the final state of these outputs. However, since the outputs are printed and not stored in any variable, we describe the printed outputs as the final state.

### Final Output State:
The final output state consists of `t` lines, each containing either `-1` or the smallest number of consecutive occurrences of any number in the respective test case's list `ar`.

Output State: **a series of t lines, each containing either -1 or the smallest number of consecutive occurrences of any number in the respective test case's list ar.**
