Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape. 

For a square, every row with '1's should have the same number of '1's, and they should be centered in the same way. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern of 1, 3, 5, ..., and the '1's should be centered in the middle of the grid.

The current program does not account for these specific patterns and conditions. Additionally, the program prints the list of counts only when the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements to print either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

Correctness: **False**
