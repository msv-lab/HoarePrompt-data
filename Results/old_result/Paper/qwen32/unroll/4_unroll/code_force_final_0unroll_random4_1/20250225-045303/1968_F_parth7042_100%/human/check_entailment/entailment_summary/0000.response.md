### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of determining whether a given subarray can be split into two or more parts with equal bitwise XOR values. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input in one go using `sys.stdin.read()` and then processes it line by line.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array elements, and the queries themselves.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - For each array, it calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
   - This is done using the formula: `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**:
   - It uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this XOR value occurs.
   - This helps in efficiently finding subarrays with a specific XOR value.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the subarray itself has a XOR of 0, and it can be trivially split into two parts with equal XOR (both parts having XOR 0).
   - If `x` is not 0, the program looks for indices in the prefix XOR map `mp` to find a way to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR.
   - It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the prefix XOR map that can potentially form such splits.

5. **Output**:
   - The program appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on whether the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.
   - Finally, it prints all results at once.

### Correctness:

The program's logic correctly implements the necessary steps to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. It efficiently calculates prefix XOR values, maps them, and uses binary search to find potential splits. The program handles all edge cases, such as subarrays with XOR 0, and outputs the correct answers for each query.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
