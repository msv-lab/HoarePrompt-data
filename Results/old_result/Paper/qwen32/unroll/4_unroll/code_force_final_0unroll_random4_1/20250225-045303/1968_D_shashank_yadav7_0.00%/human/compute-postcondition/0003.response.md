Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a` of length `n`. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
