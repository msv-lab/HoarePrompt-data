Reasoning: 

The provided program attempts to determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been moved from `a` to `c` under optimal play by Alice and Bob. However, the logic in the program does not correctly simulate the optimal play strategy for both players.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Optimal Play Strategy**: 
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - The optimal strategy involves both players making moves that will lead to the desired MEX. However, the program does not simulate the turns or the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program is supposed to calculate the MEX of the final array `c`. However, it directly computes the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in `a` or appears exactly once after the first occurrence of any integer that appears exactly once. This approach does not consider the sequence of moves or the final composition of `c`.

3. **Counter Usage**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`. This is useful, but it does not help in determining the final MEX after the optimal play sequence.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If there is any number from `0` to `n-1` that appears an odd number of times in `a`, Alice can ensure that this number is in `c` at the end, thus maximizing the MEX.
- If all numbers from `0` to `n-1` appear an even number of times, then the MEX will be the smallest number that is not in `a` or appears an odd number of times after the first occurrence of any integer that appears exactly once.

The provided program does not accurately model these conditions and thus does not correctly compute the MEX under optimal play.

Correctness: **False**
