### Reasoning:
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.

- The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It then checks the following conditions:
  - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
  - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
  - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The logic in the code aligns perfectly with the problem requirements. The program handles all possible scenarios for the three digits and prints the correct output for each case.
