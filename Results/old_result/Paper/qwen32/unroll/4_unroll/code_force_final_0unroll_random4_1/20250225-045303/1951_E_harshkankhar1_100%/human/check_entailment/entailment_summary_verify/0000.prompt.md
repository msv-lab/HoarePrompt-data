You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from the user, checks certain conditions based on the characters in the string, and prints specific messages and values depending on those conditions. The function always returns `None`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly partition the string `s` into substrings that are not palindromes for all possible inputs.

Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample:

1. The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.

2. The function `func_2()` reads a string `s` and checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES", the number of parts as 1, and the string itself as the partition. This part is correct.

3. If the entire string is a palindrome, the function tries to find the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If such a character is found, it checks if the substring starting from that character is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES", the number of parts as 2, and the two substrings. This part is also correct for some cases.

4. However, the function does not handle all cases correctly. For example, consider the string "ababa". This string is a palindrome. The function will find the first character that is different from the first character, which is 'b' at index 1. It will then check if the substring starting from index 2 ("aba") is not a palindrome. Since "aba" is a palindrome, the function will not print "YES" and will instead check if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`. In this case, `x` is 1, so the function will print "NO". However, this is incorrect because we can partition the string into "ab" and "aba", and then further partition "aba" into "ab" and "a", resulting in "ab", "ab", and "a" which are all not palindromes.

Here is a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
ababa

Expected Output:
YES
3
ab ab a

Actual Output:
NO
```

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
