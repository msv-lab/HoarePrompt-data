You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: [output values for each test case]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores (in non-decreasing order) for three players. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it outputs -1. If the sum is even, it calculates half of the total score and compares it with the sum of the first two scores, outputting the smaller of the two values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players in chess games. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, and we need to check if the scores are consistent with any valid set of games.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Points Must Be Even**: Since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1), the sum of all players' scores must be even.
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: To maximize the number of draws, we need to consider that each draw contributes 2 points. Therefore, the maximum number of draws is limited by the total points divided by 2. However, we also need to ensure that the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the scores of the three players.
2. **Even Total Points Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be consistent with any valid set of games.
3. **Calculate Maximum Draws**: The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the total number of games (since each game contributes 2 points). It then calculates `y` as `a + b`, which represents the points that the first and second players have together.
4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum number of draws is limited by the total number of games and the points that the first and second players have together.

### Correctness Check:
The logic of the program seems correct based on the observations:
- The check for even total points is necessary.
- The calculation of `x` and `y` and the subsequent `min` function correctly determine the maximum number of draws.

However, the program does not fully account for all possible inconsistencies in the scores. For example, it does not check if the scores can be achieved through a valid combination of wins and draws, which is more complex than just checking the total points and the combined points of the first two players.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case `1 1 10`. The program would output `2` because `(1 + 1 + 10) // 2 = 6` and `1 + 1 = 2`, so `min(6, 2) = 2`. However, this is incorrect because it is impossible to achieve scores of `1`, `1`, and `10` through a valid set of games. The correct output should be `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is not fully correct because it does not account for all possible inconsistencies in the scores. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
