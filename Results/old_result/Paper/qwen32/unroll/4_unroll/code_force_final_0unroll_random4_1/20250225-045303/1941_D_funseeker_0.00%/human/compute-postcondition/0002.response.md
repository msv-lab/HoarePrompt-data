The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The values of `n`, `x`, and `ans` do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `x` is the third value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing `x`**
