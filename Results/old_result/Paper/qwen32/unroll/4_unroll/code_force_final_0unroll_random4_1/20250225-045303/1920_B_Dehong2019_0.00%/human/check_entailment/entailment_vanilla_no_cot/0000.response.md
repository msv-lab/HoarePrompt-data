Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Here are the issues:

1. **Alice's Optimal Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. The current code sorts the array in descending order and then removes the largest elements, which is incorrect.

2. **Bob's Optimal Strategy**: Bob should flip the sign of the smallest elements to minimize the sum. The current code flips the largest elements, which is incorrect.

3. **Combining Strategies**: The code does not correctly combine Alice's and Bob's strategies. It does not ensure that Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob flips the smallest remaining elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes k smallest elements
        if k >= n:
            print(0)
            continue
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips x smallest elements
        for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        print(sum(a))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Alice's Strategy**: The array is sorted in ascending order, and the smallest `k` elements are removed.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: The remaining array is sorted again (which is already sorted in ascending order after Alice's removal), and the smallest `x` elements are flipped to negative.
3. **Edge Case**: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, Alice can remove all elements, resulting in a sum of `0`.

This corrected program ensures that both players play optimally according to the problem description.
