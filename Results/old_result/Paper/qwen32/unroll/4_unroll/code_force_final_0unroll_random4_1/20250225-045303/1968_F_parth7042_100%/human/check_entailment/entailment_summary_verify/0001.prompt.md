You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within a specified range whose XOR is 0, and returns 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine if a subarray of the given array is "interesting" based on the criteria described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input in one go and processes it in a single pass.
   - It first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array elements and the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array. The prefix XOR up to index `i` (i.e., `pf[i]`) is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
   - This is done using the formula `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding where a particular XOR value appears in the prefix XOR array.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` using the formula `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the subarray can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR 0, so the subarray is "interesting".
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there exists a prefix XOR value `pf[r]` that appears after `l - 1` and a prefix XOR value `pf[l - 1]` that appears before `r`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the lists stored in the dictionary `mp`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program appends "YES" or "NO" to the results list based on whether the subarray is interesting or not.
   - Finally, it prints all the results.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting. It uses prefix XOR and binary search to efficiently process each query. The use of prefix XOR allows the program to quickly calculate the XOR of any subarray, and the dictionary `mp` helps in efficiently finding the required indices.

The program handles all edge cases, including when the subarray can be trivially split (when the XOR of the subarray is 0) and when the subarray cannot be split into parts with equal XOR.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
