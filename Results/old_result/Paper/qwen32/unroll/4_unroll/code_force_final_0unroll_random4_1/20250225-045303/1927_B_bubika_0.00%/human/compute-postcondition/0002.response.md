In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only includes the variable `t`. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because `range(int(input()))` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
2. The provided state already specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is already in a valid range for the loop to execute.

Since `t` is already in the correct range, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. However, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed the variable being iterated over in the loop. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains as given, with the understanding that `t` is the correct variable being iterated over in the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros**
