Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, which are non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively. It returns -1 if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is None; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.**
