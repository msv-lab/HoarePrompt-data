The given code snippet defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning the result as a list. This function does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, or `p` directly; it merely sets up a way to read and process input.

Given that the initial state does not specify any values for `t`, `n`, or `p` beyond their constraints, and the lambda function `I` is defined but not called, these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `p` is a permutation of the integers from 0 to n-1 for each test case. The lambda function `I` is defined to read and convert a line of input into a list of integers.**
