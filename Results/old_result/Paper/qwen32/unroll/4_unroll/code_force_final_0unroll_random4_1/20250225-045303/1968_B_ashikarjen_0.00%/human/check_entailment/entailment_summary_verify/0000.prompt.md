You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of characters from `a` that can appear in `b` in the same order, without reusing characters in `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is supposed to determine the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`.

Here's the program:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
```

### Correctness Check

1. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is initialized to 0 to count the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0 to iterate through string `b`.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each character in string `a` using index `i`.
   
3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner `while` loop continues to increment `j` until it finds a character in `b` that matches `a[i]` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   
4. **Matching Characters**:
   - If a match is found (`j < m`), `k` is incremented and `j` is moved to the next character in `b` for the next comparison.
   
5. **No Match Found**:
   - If no match is found (`j >= m`), the loop breaks, and the current value of `k` is printed.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly.

#### Example 1:
```
Input:
6
5 4
10011
1110
3 3
100
110
1 3
1
111
4 4
1011
1111
3 5
100
11010
3 1
100
0

Output:
2
2
1
1
3
0
```

- **First Test Case**:
  - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
  - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"10"`, so `k = 2`.

- **Second Test Case**:
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "110"`
  - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"10"`, so `k = 2`.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - `a = "1"`, `b = "111"`
  - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"1"`, so `k = 1`.

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - `a = "1011"`, `b = "1111"`
  - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"101"`, so `k = 1`.

- **Fifth Test Case**:
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "11010"`
  - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"100"`, so `k = 3`.

- **Sixth Test Case**:
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`
  - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `""`, so `k = 0`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided examples. It iterates through each character of `a` and tries to find a matching subsequence in `b` by maintaining a pointer `j` in `b`. If a match is found, it increments the count `k` and continues. If no match is found, it breaks out of the loop and prints the count.

Given that the program correctly handles the provided examples and there are no apparent logical errors, we can conclude that the program is correct.

### Final Answer
