Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from the input, representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b` respectively; `a` is a binary string of length `n`; `b` is a binary string of length `m` read from the input; `k` is 0; `j` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `j` has been initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
