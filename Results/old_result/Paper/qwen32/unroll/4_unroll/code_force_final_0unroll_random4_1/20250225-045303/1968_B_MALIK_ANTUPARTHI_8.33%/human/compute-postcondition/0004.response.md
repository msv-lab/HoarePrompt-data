Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. It then computes and prints an integer `k` for each test case, which represents the position in string `a` up to which characters can be matched sequentially in string `b`.**
