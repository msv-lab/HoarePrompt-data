Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives four positive integers `h` and `w`, representing the height and width of a rectangle, and four more positive integers `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`, representing the coordinates of two distinct points within the rectangle. The function returns a value for each test case based on the given coordinates, ensuring that the sum of all `h` values does not exceed 1,000,000.**
