Reasoning: 
The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function, `func_2`, reads input data, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to determine if each array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation.

`func_1` works by creating a doubled version of the input list `a` (i.e., `concatenated_a = a + a`). It then checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` (the length of the original list `a`) within this doubled list matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence is found, it means that the array can be split and swapped in such a way that it becomes sorted. If no such subsequence is found after checking all possibilities, the function returns 'No'.

The logic in `func_1` is correct according to the problem's requirements. By doubling the array, it effectively simulates all possible splits and swaps of the original array. Checking for the sorted subsequence within this doubled array ensures that all possible rotations of the array are considered. If the sorted subsequence is found, it confirms that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order through the allowed operations.

Since `func_2` correctly handles input parsing and result aggregation, and `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted, the entire program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
