Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is not a good practice and can lead to bugs if the functions are called multiple times. Instead, these variables should be passed as parameters or returned from the functions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**: The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required. The problem requires the minimum number of cliques, and this calculation does not guarantee that.

3. **Incorrect Array Initialization**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized with zeros, but they are supposed to contain distinct integers from 1 to `n` and clique identifiers, respectively. The function `make_array` does not properly initialize these arrays.

4. **Incorrect Logic in `make_array`**: The logic in `make_array` does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. The function simply assigns values to the array in a specific pattern without checking the condition.

5. **Incorrect Output**: The function `func_1` prints the results directly, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the incorrectness:

For the input:
```
1
5 4
```

The program might output something like:
```
0 0 0 0 0
2
0 0 0 0 0
```

This output is clearly incorrect because:
- The values in `arr` should be distinct integers from 1 to 5.
- The number of cliques should be the minimum required, and the partition should satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

A correct output for this input could be:
```
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Or another valid output could be:
```
5 4 3 2 1
1
1 1 1 1 1
```

However, the provided program does not guarantee such a correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
