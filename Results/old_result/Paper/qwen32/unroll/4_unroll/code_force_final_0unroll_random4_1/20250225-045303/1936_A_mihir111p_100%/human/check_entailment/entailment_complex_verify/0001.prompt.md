You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #The program returns the value provided by the user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each within the range from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of a secret permutation `p`. It prints these four integers in a specific format and returns the value provided by the user input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find two indices i and j of a permutation p such that the XOR of the elements at these indices, p_i ⊕ p_j, is maximized. We can achieve this by making at most 3n queries, where each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the permutation.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of n (the length of the permutation).

2. **Finding the Maximum Element (ans1):**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to n-1.
   - For each index `i`, it performs a query comparing the OR of `ans1` with itself (`p_ans1 | p_ans1`) and the OR of `i` with itself (`p_i | p_i`).
   - If the result of the comparison is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`.
   - This step aims to find the index of the maximum element in the permutation. However, the comparison `p_ans1 | p_ans1` is always equal to `p_ans1`, and `p_i | p_i` is always equal to `p_i`, so the query is effectively comparing `p_ans1` and `p_i`.

3. **Finding Potential Candidates (v):**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to n-1.
   - For each index `i`, it performs a query comparing the OR of `mx` with `ans1` (`p_mx | p_ans1`) and the OR of `i` with `ans1` (`p_i | p_ans1`).
   - If the result of the comparison is `<`, it clears the list `v`, updates `mx` to `i`, and adds `i` to `v`.
   - If the result of the comparison is `=`, it adds `i` to `v`.
   - This step aims to find indices that have the same OR value when combined with `ans1` as the maximum value found so far.

4. **Finding the Best Pair (ans, ans1):**
   - The program initializes `mx` to the first element in `v` and `ans` to the first element in `v`.
   - It iterates through the elements in `v` starting from the second element.
   - For each element `i` in `v`, it performs a query comparing the OR of `ans` with itself (`p_ans | p_ans`) and the OR of `i` with itself (`p_i | p_i`).
   - If the result of the comparison is `>`, it updates `ans` to `i`.
   - This step aims to find the index in `v` that has the maximum value when compared with itself, which is essentially finding the maximum value in `v`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the pair that maximizes the XOR.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Finding the Maximum Element (ans1):**
  - The logic to find the maximum element `ans1` is correct because it effectively compares each element with the current maximum and updates the maximum if a larger element is found.

- **Finding Potential Candidates (v):**
  - The logic to find potential candidates `v` is flawed. The query `(p_mx | p_ans1) vs (p_i | p_ans1)` does not help in identifying elements that maximize the XOR. It only helps in identifying elements that have the same OR value when combined with `ans1`.

- **Finding the Best Pair (ans, ans1):**
  - The logic to find the best pair `(ans, ans1)` is flawed because it only considers elements in `v` and compares them with themselves, which does not guarantee finding the pair with the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR. It fails to effectively use the queries to identify the pair with the maximum XOR value.

**Correctness: False**
