The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of the remaining elements in the array `a` after allowing Alice to remove up to `k` elements and Bob to multiply up to `x` elements by -1.
