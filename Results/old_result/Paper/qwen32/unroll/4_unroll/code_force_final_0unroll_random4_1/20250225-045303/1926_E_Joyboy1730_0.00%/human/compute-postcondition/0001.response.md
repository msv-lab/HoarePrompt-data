In the provided task, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which determines the number of iterations. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, so the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Given the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to consider any internal state changes or dependencies within the loop body for this specific task.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be set to a value within the specified range. The simplest and most straightforward adjustment would be to set `t` to the minimum value in the range, which is 1.

State: **`t` is 1**
