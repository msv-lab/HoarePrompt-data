To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic behind the solution and see if it aligns with the problem requirements. The goal is to find the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by optimally choosing which numbers to remove.

### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.

2. **Properties of XOR**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero.
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

3. **Numbers in the Sequence**:
   - Numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - XOR of 1 and 3 is 2.
   - XOR of 2 and 4 is 6 (which is 2 in binary, but since we are only dealing with numbers up to 4, this effectively means 2 XOR 4 is 0 in our context).
   - XOR of 1 and 2 is 3.
   - XOR of 1 and 4 is 5 (which is 1 in binary, but since we are only dealing with numbers up to 4, this effectively means 1 XOR 4 is 1 in our context).
   - XOR of 3 and 4 is 7 (which is 3 in binary, but since we are only dealing with numbers up to 4, this effectively means 3 XOR 4 is 3 in our context).

4. **Strategy for Bob to Win**:
   - Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - To achieve this, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers can be paired up to produce XORs that cancel each other out.

### Analysis of the Program

The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`.

- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs of each type of number that can be removed, ensuring that the remaining numbers are either single numbers or can be paired to cancel each other out.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there is exactly one of each type of number left after pairing, which would result in a XOR of zero (since 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 is 0).

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + int(0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12`
   - Output: `12` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by optimally removing numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
