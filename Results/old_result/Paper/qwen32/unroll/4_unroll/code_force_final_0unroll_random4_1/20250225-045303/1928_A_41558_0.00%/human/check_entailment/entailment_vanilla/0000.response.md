Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

Bob starts with a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. After cutting, he wants to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

### Key Observations

1. **Single Unit Rectangle:** If either `a` or `b` is 1, and the other side is also 1, it's impossible to cut it into two smaller rectangles. Hence, the answer is "NO".
2. **Cutting Possibilities:**
   - If `a` is even, we can cut it into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
   - If `b` is even, we can cut it into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
3. **Forming New Rectangles:**
   - If `a` is even, the two `a/2 x b` rectangles can be arranged to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2) x (2b)`.
   - If `b` is even, the two `a x b/2` rectangles can be arranged to form a new rectangle of size `(2a) x (b/2)`.
4. **Special Case:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. Hence, the answer is "NO".
   - If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the resulting rectangles from the cut will be the same as the original rectangle when rearranged, hence the answer is "NO".

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program against these observations.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic:**
   - The program first checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to form a new rectangle.
   - It then checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original rectangle when rearranged.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to form a new rectangle.

### Issues in the Program

The primary issue in the program is the way it checks for the condition `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. The program uses floating-point division (`/`), which can lead to precision issues and incorrect results. Instead, integer division (`//`) should be used to check if one dimension is exactly half of the other.

### Corrected Logic

The correct logic should be:

- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "NO".
- If `a % 2 == 0` and `a // 2 != b`, or if `b % 2 == 0` and `b // 2 != a`, print "YES".
- Otherwise, print "NO".

### Conclusion

The provided program has a logical flaw due to the use of floating-point division. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
