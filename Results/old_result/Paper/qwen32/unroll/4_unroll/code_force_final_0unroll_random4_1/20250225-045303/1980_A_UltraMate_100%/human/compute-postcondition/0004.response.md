Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of additions required to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears in the string at least `m` times.**
