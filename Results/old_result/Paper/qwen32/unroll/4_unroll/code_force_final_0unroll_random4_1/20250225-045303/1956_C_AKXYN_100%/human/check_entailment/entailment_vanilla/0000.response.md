Let's analyze the provided program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations. There are two types of operations:
1. Type 1: Choose a row and fill it with a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
2. Type 2: Choose a column and fill it with a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

The optimal strategy to maximize the sum is to fill each row and each column with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n]. This ensures that every element in the matrix is filled with the maximum possible value it can take.

### Program Analysis:
The program does the following:
1. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix n.
2. It initializes a matrix `mat` where each row is filled with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n].
3. It calculates the sum `res` of the matrix, which should be the sum of the first n natural numbers, each appearing in the matrix in a way that maximizes the overall sum. The formula used for `res` is `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is not the correct formula for the sum of the matrix.
4. It prints the calculated sum `res` and the number of operations (which is `2 * n`).
5. It then prints the operations: for each row and column, it prints the operation of filling it with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., n].

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not correctly calculate the sum of the matrix. The correct sum of the matrix when each row and column is filled with [1, 2, 3, ..., n] is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.
2. **Output Format**: The operations are printed correctly, but the sum is not.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the sum calculation, the program is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation:
To correct the program, we need to change the sum calculation to `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Correct sum calculation
        res = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
