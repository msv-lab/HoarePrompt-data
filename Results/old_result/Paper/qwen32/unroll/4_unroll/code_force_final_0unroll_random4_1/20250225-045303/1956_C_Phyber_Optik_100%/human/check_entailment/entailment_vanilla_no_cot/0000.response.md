Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and does not generate the correct operations to achieve that sum.

### Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum as `1 + (2^2 - 1^2) * 2 + (3^2 - 2^2) * 3 + ... + (n^2 - (n-1)^2) * n`.
   - This simplifies to `1 + 4 + 9 + ... + n^2`, which is the sum of the first `n` squares, not the maximum possible sum for the matrix.
   - The maximum possible sum for the matrix is `n * n * n` because each element of the matrix can be set to `n` using the operations.

2. **Operations Description:**
   - The operations described in the program are incorrect for achieving the maximum sum.
   - To achieve the maximum sum, each element of the matrix should be set to `n`.
   - This can be done by performing `n` Type 1 operations and `n` Type 2 operations, each time setting the row or column to the permutation `[n, n, ..., n]`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, the maximum sum is `n * n * n`.
- Perform `n` Type 1 operations to set each row to `[n, n, ..., n]`.
- Perform `n` Type 2 operations to set each column to `[n, n, ..., n]`.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * n
        print(max_sum, n + n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *([n] * n))
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, *([n] * n))

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates the operations to achieve that sum.
