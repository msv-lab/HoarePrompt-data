The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. However, the loop actually depends on the value obtained from `int(input())`. This value determines how many times the loop will execute.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, we need to ensure that the input to the loop (i.e., the value obtained from `int(input())`) is set to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Since the loop head does not directly involve `t`, `n`, or `a`, we only need to adjust the input value to match `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input to the loop must be `t`**
