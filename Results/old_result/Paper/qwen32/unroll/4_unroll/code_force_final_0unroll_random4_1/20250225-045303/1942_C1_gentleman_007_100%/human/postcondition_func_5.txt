The function `func_6` takes two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of pairs of vertices. It returns a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with `1`s at positions corresponding to the pairs of vertices returned by `func_1()`, and `0`s elsewhere.
