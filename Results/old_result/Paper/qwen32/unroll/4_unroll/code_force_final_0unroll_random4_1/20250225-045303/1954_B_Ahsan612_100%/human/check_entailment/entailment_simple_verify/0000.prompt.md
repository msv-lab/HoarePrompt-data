You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

        same = 1

        i = 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem description. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. If it's impossible, the function should return -1.

Here's the provided program:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` keeps track of the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` keeps track of the current element being compared.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` to find the minimum length of such sequences.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, the length of the previous sequence (`same`) is compared with `minn`, and `minn` is updated if `same` is smaller.
   - `num` is updated to the current element `ar[i]`, and `same` is reset to 1.
   - The loop increments `i` twice in the `else` block, which is incorrect because it skips elements.

3. **Final check**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time to account for the last sequence.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or `minn` equals the length of the array (`len(ar)`), it means all elements are the same or no sequence was found, so the function prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues:
- The loop increments `i` twice in the `else` block, which causes it to skip elements. This is incorrect.
- The program does not handle all cases correctly, especially when the array contains sequences of identical elements interspersed with different elements.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 2
```
The program will incorrectly output `1` because it skips elements and does not correctly calculate the minimum sequence length.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle cases where the sequence of identical elements is interspersed with different elements due to the incorrect increment of `i`. This leads to incorrect calculations of the minimum sequence length, and thus, incorrect results.
