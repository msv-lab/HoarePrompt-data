Let's analyze the given program against the problem description and the provided example inputs and outputs.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Total Points Parity**: The total points across all players `(p1 + p2 + p3)` must be even because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each in case of a draw).
2. **Score Consistency**: The scores must be achievable through a series of games played between the three players.
3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program needs to correctly compute the maximum number of draws.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Total Points Parity Check**: The program correctly checks if the total points are even. If not, it outputs `-1`.
- **Score Consistency Check**: The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If true, it means that the highest score `p3` could be achieved by the player winning all games against the other two players. In this case, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` (since `p3` could have won `p3 - p1` games against player 1 and `p3 - p2` games against player 2, and the remaining `p1 + p2` points must be draws).
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating over possible values. It calculates `low` and `high` which represent the minimum and maximum possible differences between `p3` and `p1`, and `p3` and `p2` respectively. The program then iterates to find a valid configuration where the remaining points can be distributed as draws.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:
1. **Input:** `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0` (even)
   - No games were played, so no draws.
   - **Output:** `0` (Correct)
2. **Input:** `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2` (even)
   - One draw between the second and third player.
   - **Output:** `1` (Correct)
3. **Input:** `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3` (odd)
   - **Output:** `-1` (Correct)
4. **Input:** `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4` (even)
   - Two draws possible.
   - **Output:** `2` (Correct)
5. **Input:** `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9` (odd)
   - **Output:** `-1` (Correct)
6. **Input:** `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Six draws possible.
   - **Output:** `6` (Correct)
7. **Input:** `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12` (even)
   - Two draws possible.
   - **Output:** `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
