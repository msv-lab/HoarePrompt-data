To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the condition in the `while` loop: `l + 1 < r`.

Here's the analysis:

- `l` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is initialized to `len(arr)`, which is the length of the list `arr`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `l + 1 < r` must be true. Let's break it down:

1. If `arr` is an empty list (`len(arr) == 0`), then `r` is 0. The condition `0 + 1 < 0` is false, so the loop will not execute.
2. If `arr` has only one element (`len(arr) == 1`), then `r` is 1. The condition `0 + 1 < 1` is false, so the loop will not execute.
3. If `arr` has two or more elements (`len(arr) >= 2`), then `r` is at least 2. The condition `0 + 1 < 2` is true, so the loop will execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the list `arr` must have at least two elements.

The states that need to be adjusted are `arr` and `r`. Specifically, `r` must be at least 2, which means `arr` must have at least two elements.

State: **`arr` must have at least two elements, `predicate` is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value, `l` is 0, `r` is len(arr) and must be at least 2**
