Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of elements in the first list and `m` is the number of elements in the second list. It also accepts two lists: the first list contains `n` integers `a_i`, and the second list contains `m` integers `b_i`. The function returns a value or values based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**
