t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), m (an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5), a (a binary string of length n), and b (a binary string of length m). The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
