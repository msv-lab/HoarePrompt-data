To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided loop and how it modifies the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h`.

Let's break down the loop:
1. The loop iterates over the `costs` list, which is initialized as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
2. For each `i` in `costs`, it calculates `curr` as `n // i`.
3. It then adds `curr` to `h` and subtracts `i * curr` from `n`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the loop iterations:

### First Iteration:
- `i = n - k + 1`
- `curr = n // (n - k + 1)`
- `h += curr`
- `n -= (n - k + 1) * curr`

This step essentially divides `n` by `n - k + 1` and adjusts `n` and `h` accordingly.

### Second Iteration:
- `i = 1`
- `curr = n // 1` which is simply `n`
- `h += n`
- `n -= 1 * n` which means `n = 0`

After the second iteration, `n` becomes 0, and the loop terminates.

### Final Values:
- `n` is 0 after the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `costs` remains unchanged.
- `h` accumulates the sum of the quotients calculated in each iteration.

### Calculation of `h`:
- In the first iteration, `h` is incremented by `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- In the second iteration, `h` is incremented by the remaining value of `n` after the first iteration, which is `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`.

Given the nature of integer division, the final value of `h` is effectively the sum of the integer divisions of `n` by `n - k + 1` and the remainder, which is just `n` itself in the second iteration.

Thus, the final value of `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + (n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))) + n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`, which simplifies to `n // (n - k + 1) + n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1)) + n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`, and finally, `h` becomes `n // (n - k + 1) + k - 1`.

Output State: **n: 0, k: k, costs: [n - k + 1, 1], h: n // (n - k + 1) + k - 1.**
