To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`. The loop will execute if `removals` is at least 1, because the range function `range(1, removals + 1)` will generate at least one iteration if `removals` is 1 or more.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables in the loop head**: `i` and `removals`.
2. **Condition for loop execution**: `removals` must be at least 1 to ensure that the loop executes at least once.
3. **Initial state of `i`**: The loop initializes `i` to 1, so we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.
4. **Adjustments**: We need to ensure that `removals` is at least 1.

The initial state provided does not mention any specific value for `removals`, so we need to adjust it to ensure the loop can execute.

**Adjusted State**:
State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of elements, `s2` is the sum of `elements[-negatives:]`**
