You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) denoting the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing either `-1` if the sum of the scores for that test case is odd, or the calculated result if the sum is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates and outputs a specific result based on the scores.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective:** Determine the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games among three players, given their final scores.
- **Constraints:** 
  - Scores are provided in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
  - Each game results in either:
    - 2 points for the winner and 0 for the loser.
    - 1 point each for a draw.
  - Output the maximum number of draws, or -1 if the scores are impossible.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
```

### Verification Steps:
1. **Check the Sum of Scores:**
   - The total points from all games must be even because each game awards a total of 2 points.
   - If the sum of scores is odd, it is impossible to achieve those scores, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Calculate the Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - Let's analyze this formula for different cases.

### Detailed Case Analysis:
- **Case 1: No Games Played (0 0 0)**
  - Sum of scores is 0, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 0 - 0 - 0) = 0\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{0 - 0}{2} = 0\)
  - Correct output: `0`.

- **Case 2: One Draw (0 1 1)**
  - Sum of scores is 2, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 1 - 0 - 1) = 0\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1\)
  - Correct output: `1`.

- **Case 3: Impossible Scores (1 1 1)**
  - Sum of scores is 3, which is odd.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Case 4: Two Draws (1 1 2)**
  - Sum of scores is 4, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = 0\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2\)
  - Correct output: `2`.

- **Case 5: Impossible Scores (3 3 3)**
  - Sum of scores is 9, which is odd.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Case 6: Six Draws (3 4 5)**
  - Sum of scores is 12, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 5 - 3 - 4) = 0\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{12 - 0}{2} = 6\)
  - Correct output: `6`.

- **Case 7: Two Draws (1 1 10)**
  - Sum of scores is 12, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 10 - 1 - 1) = 8\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{12 - 8}{2} = 2\)
  - Correct output: `2`.

### Conclusion:
After verifying the program against multiple cases, it appears to correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. The formula used correctly calculates the maximum number of draws or determines if the scores are impossible.

**Correctness: True**.

The program correctly handles the given problem description for all potential cases that we have verified.
