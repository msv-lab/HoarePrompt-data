Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix according to the problem description. Let's analyze why:

1. The program initializes the matrix with the first `n` natural numbers in each row:
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   This is a good start, but it does not perform the operations described in the problem statement to maximize the sum.

2. The program calculates the result `res` as follows:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   This formula does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The formula seems to be derived from the sum of squares but does not account for the optimal arrangement of numbers in the matrix.

3. The program then prints the result and the operations:
   ```python
   print(res, n << 1)
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   The operations printed are not optimal for maximizing the sum. They simply assign the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to each row and column, which does not guarantee the maximum sum.

To maximize the sum of the matrix, we should use the optimal arrangement of numbers. One optimal way is to use the identity permutation for each row and column, which ensures that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and each column. This arrangement is essentially a Latin square, and it guarantees the maximum sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        res = n * (n * n + 1) // 2  # Sum of all numbers from 1 to n^2
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The result `res` is calculated as the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers, which is the maximum possible sum.
- The operations are still 2n, but they are optimal for achieving the maximum sum.

The original program does not achieve the maximum sum for any `n > 1`, hence it is incorrect.
