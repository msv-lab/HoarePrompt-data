Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in the list `a` or appears exactly once in the list `a` after the first occurrence of any integer that appears exactly once.**
