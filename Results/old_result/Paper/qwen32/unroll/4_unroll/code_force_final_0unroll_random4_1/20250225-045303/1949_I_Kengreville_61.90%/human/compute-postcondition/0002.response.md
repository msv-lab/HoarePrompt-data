Output State: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, `x` is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the disks, `y` is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the disks, `r` is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited, `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of the disks being processed and now includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of coefficients used in the calculations, and `n` is the total number of disks. The current value of `visited[i]` is True.**

In natural language, the `nodes` list now includes the index `i` of the disk that was already marked as visited. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
