Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly partition the string `s` into substrings that are not palindromes for all possible inputs.

Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample:

1. The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.

2. The function `func_2()` reads a string `s` and checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES", the number of parts as 1, and the string itself as the partition. This part is correct.

3. If the entire string is a palindrome, the function tries to find the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If such a character is found, it checks if the substring starting from that character is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES", the number of parts as 2, and the two substrings. This part is also correct for some cases.

4. However, the function does not handle all cases correctly. For example, consider the string "ababa". This string is a palindrome. The function will find the first character that is different from the first character, which is 'b' at index 1. It will then check if the substring starting from index 2 ("aba") is not a palindrome. Since "aba" is a palindrome, the function will not print "YES" and will instead check if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`. In this case, `x` is 1, so the function will print "NO". However, this is incorrect because we can partition the string into "ab" and "aba", and then further partition "aba" into "ab" and "a", resulting in "ab", "ab", and "a" which are all not palindromes.

Here is a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
ababa

Expected Output:
YES
3
ab ab a

Actual Output:
NO
```

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
