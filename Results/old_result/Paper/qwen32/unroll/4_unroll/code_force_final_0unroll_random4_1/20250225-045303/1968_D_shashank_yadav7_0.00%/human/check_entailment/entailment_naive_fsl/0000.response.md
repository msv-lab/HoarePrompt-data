Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that can lead to incorrect results. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     are incorrect. The `max` function is used inappropriately here. The scores should simply be incremented by the value of the current position in each turn.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic is flawed. The loop should run exactly `k` times, but the condition `if k == 0: break` inside the loop can cause the loop to terminate prematurely if `k` is reduced to zero before the loop completes `k` iterations.
   - Additionally, the score updates inside the loop are incorrect and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Initialization Issues**:
   - The initial scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k`, respectively. This is incorrect because the scores should start at `a[b]` and `a[s]` and then be incremented by the values of the positions visited in each turn.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the scores are updated correctly in each turn and that the loop runs exactly `k` times.
