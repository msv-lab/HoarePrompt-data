Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is not handling all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` has a hardcoded condition that returns `0` when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`. This hardcoded condition is not aligned with the optimal strategy that both Alice and Bob would follow to maximize and minimize the sum, respectively.

Here are some issues and a counterexample:

1. **Hardcoded Condition**: The function `func_2` includes a hardcoded condition:
    ```python
    if removals == 6 and negatives == 3:
        return 0
    ```
    This condition will always return `0` for this specific scenario, which is not guaranteed to be the optimal result for all arrays.

2. **Suboptimal Strategy**: The logic inside the loop and the way the sum is calculated does not always yield the optimal result. For example, the code does not correctly handle scenarios where the optimal strategy involves removing certain elements and then flipping others.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2 2
-1 -2 -3 -4
```
- **Alice's Move**: Alice can remove two elements to maximize the sum. The optimal strategy is to remove `-3` and `-4`, leaving `-1` and `-2`.
- **Bob's Move**: Bob can then flip two elements to minimize the sum. The optimal strategy is to flip `-1` and `-2`, resulting in `1` and `2`.

The final sum should be `1 + 2 = 3`. However, the provided program will not produce this result because it does not correctly handle the removal and flipping logic for all possible cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and fails to provide the correct result for the given counterexample. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
