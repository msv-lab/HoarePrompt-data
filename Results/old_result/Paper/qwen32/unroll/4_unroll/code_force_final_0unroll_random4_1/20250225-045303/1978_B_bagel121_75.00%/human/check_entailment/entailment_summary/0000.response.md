### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program's logic to see if it correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `a >= b`, the program sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
     - This is because the modified price would be less than or equal to the usual price, so there's no benefit to using the promotion.
     - The profit in this case is simply `n * a`.
   - If `a < b`, the program determines the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price.
     - The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This is because the modified price sequence `(b, b-1, ..., b-k+1)` can only be as long as the difference between `b` and `a` (plus one), and it cannot be longer than the number of buns `n`.
     - The sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, ..., b-k+1)` is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `sum = (first_term + last_term) * number_of_terms / 2`. Here, the first term is `b`, the last term is `b - k + 1`, and the number of terms is `k`.
     - The remaining buns `(n - k)` are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two components.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the calculated profit.

### Evaluation:

- The program correctly handles the case where `a >= b` by selling all buns at the usual price.
- For `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` and computes the profit correctly by summing the modified prices and the usual prices for the remaining buns.
- The arithmetic series sum formula is correctly applied to calculate the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
- The program handles large inputs efficiently, as it uses integer arithmetic and avoids unnecessary loops.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the given test cases accurately.

**Correctness: True**
