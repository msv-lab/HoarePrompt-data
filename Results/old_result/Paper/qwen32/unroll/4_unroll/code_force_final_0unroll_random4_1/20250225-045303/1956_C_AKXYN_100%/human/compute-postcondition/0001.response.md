To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the provided loop and understand the operations performed within it. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs for `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Operations**:
   - For each test case, an integer `n` is read, which represents the size of an `n Ã— n` matrix.
   - A matrix `mat` is created with each row containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - A variable `res` is initialized to 0 and then updated in a loop that runs `n` times. In each iteration, `res` is incremented by `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.
   - The value of `res` and `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`) are printed.
   - Two nested loops print specific patterns:
     - The first nested loop runs from `n` to 1, and for each iteration, it prints a line starting with `1 i` followed by numbers from 1 to `n`.
     - The second nested loop runs from `n` to 1, and for each iteration, it prints a line starting with `2 i` followed by numbers from 1 to `n`.

To summarize the output state after all iterations:
- The matrix `mat` is created and discarded in each iteration, so it does not affect the final output state.
- The variable `res` is recalculated for each test case and printed.
- The value `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`) is printed for each test case.
- The patterns printed in the nested loops do not affect the final output state in terms of variable values but contribute to the printed output.

Since the question asks for the output state in terms of the variables in the loop head and body, and since `mat` is not retained, the only variables that affect the output are `res` and `n`.

Given that `res` is recalculated for each test case and `n` is read for each test case, the output state will be a series of printed lines for each test case, but the final state of the variables `res` and `n` after all iterations would be the values from the last test case.

Thus, the output state in the required format is:

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

However, since the output is a series of printed lines and not the final state of variables, we can describe the final printed output for the last test case:

Output State: **The output will be a series of printed lines for each test case, with the final printed lines being the result of the last test case. Specifically, it will be `res` and `2 * n` followed by the patterns printed in the nested loops for the last test case.**
