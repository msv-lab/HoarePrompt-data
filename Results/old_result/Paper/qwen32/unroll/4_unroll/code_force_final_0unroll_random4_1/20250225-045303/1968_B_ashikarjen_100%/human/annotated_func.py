#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` takes no input arguments. The input is provided via standard input (stdin) and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The next two lines contain the binary strings a and b of lengths n and m. The total sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b` respectively; `a` is a binary string of length `n`; `b` is a binary string of length `m`; `k` is the number of matched characters; `j` is the position in `b` after the last match or `m` if the loop broke due to a mismatch.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of matched characters between the binary strings `a` and `b`)
    return
    #The program does not return any value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two binary strings. It calculates and prints the number of characters in the first binary string that can be matched with characters in the second binary string in order. The function does not return any value.
