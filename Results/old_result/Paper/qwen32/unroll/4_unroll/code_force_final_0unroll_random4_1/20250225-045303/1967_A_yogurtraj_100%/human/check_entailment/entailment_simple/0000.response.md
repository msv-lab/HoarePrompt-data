### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of maximizing the score by distributing additional cards in such a way that the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` which are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` (number of distinct card types), `k` (number of additional cards that can be bought), and the list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial count of each card type.

2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This helps in determining the minimum number of cards needed to make all card counts equal up to a certain point.

3. **Distributing Cards**: The program iterates through the sorted list `a` to determine how many additional cards can be used to make the counts of the first `i+1` card types equal. It does this by checking if `k` is sufficient to make the counts of the first `i+1` card types equal to `a[i+1]`. If `k` is not sufficient, it calculates the new maximum count `r` that can be achieved with the available `k` and the number of remaining cards `rem` that can be distributed further.

4. **Final Calculation**: If `k` is still not zero after the loop, it means that all card counts up to the last element in the list `a` are equal, and the remaining `k` cards can be distributed to further increase the count of the maximum card type `a[n-1]`. The program then calculates the maximum score based on the final card counts.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the maximum score.

### Evaluation:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the score by distributing the additional cards optimally. The use of sorting and the step-by-step distribution of cards ensures that the program efficiently calculates the maximum number of permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` that can be formed.

The provided example outputs match the expected results, indicating that the program correctly handles the given test cases. However, to ensure correctness, we would need to test the program with a wider range of test cases, including edge cases, to confirm that it handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program seems to be correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
