Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is an array of \( n \) integers chosen from \( b_i \) and arranged to maximize the difference.
- **Approach**: Vasya should choose \( n \) integers from \( b_i \) such that the sum of absolute differences with \( a_i \) is maximized.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \( b \) is sorted in descending order.

3. **Pairing Strategy**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates over the first \( n \) elements of the sorted \( a \) and \( b \) arrays.
   - For each pair \( (a_i, b_i) \), it calculates the absolute difference \( |a_i - b_i| \).
   - It also checks if using the largest available element from \( b \) (i.e., \( b[-(n-i)] \)) would yield a larger difference than \( |a_i - b_i| \).
   - If a larger difference is found, it switches to using the largest available element from \( b \) for the remaining elements of \( a \).

4. **Output**:
   - The program sums the absolute differences stored in `ans` and prints the result.

### Evaluation:
- The strategy of sorting \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order is a greedy approach to maximize the differences.
- The program correctly implements the logic to switch to using the largest available elements from \( b \) when it finds a larger potential difference.
- The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct result for each.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference \( D \) as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
