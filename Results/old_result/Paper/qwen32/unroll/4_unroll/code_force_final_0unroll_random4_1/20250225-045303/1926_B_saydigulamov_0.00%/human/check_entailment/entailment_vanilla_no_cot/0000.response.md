Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Logic for Checking Shapes**: The program does not implement any logic to check if the `1`s form a triangle or a square. It only checks if the count of `1`s in the first two rows with `1`s is the same, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

2. **Output**: The program prints the list `k` instead of the required output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

3. **Handling Upside Down Triangles**: The program does not handle upside-down triangles.

4. **Handling Different Sizes**: The program does not correctly handle different sizes of triangles and squares.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to implement logic to check the shape formed by the `1`s in the grid. This involves checking whether the `1`s form a square or a triangle (including upside-down triangles) based on the problem's description.
