The code snippet initializes `u2vs` as a list of empty lists, where the number of empty lists is equal to the value of `n`. This means that for each vertex in the tree, there is now an empty list that will eventually hold the indices of adjacent vertices. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` is the integer input by the user representing the number of vertices in the tree, and it is guaranteed that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^3.**
