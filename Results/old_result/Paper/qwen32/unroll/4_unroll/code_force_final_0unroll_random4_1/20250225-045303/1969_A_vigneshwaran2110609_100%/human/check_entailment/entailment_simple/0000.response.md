### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends, `n`, and the list of best friends, `p`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `p`.
   - It then iterates over the list `p` to check if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., if `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

3. **Output Explanation**:
   - If a pair of friends who are each other's best friends exists, sending invitations to both of them will ensure that both come to the party, so the answer is `2`.
   - If no such pair exists, the program assumes the worst case where the minimum number of invitations required is `3`. However, this assumption is not always correct because there might be other configurations that require fewer than `3` invitations. For example, if there are multiple disjoint pairs, sending invitations to one pair would suffice.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and outputs `2` in such cases.
   - However, the program incorrectly assumes that if no such pair exists, the answer must be `3`. It does not consider other possible configurations that might require fewer than `3` invitations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider configurations where more than one pair of friends are each other's best friends, or where a single pair or fewer invitations can suffice. Therefore, the program is not always correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
