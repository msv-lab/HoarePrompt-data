In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `kp` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. The variables `t`, `n`, `p`, and `R` are not directly involved in controlling the loop's execution. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be read by `int(input())` to determine the number of iterations.

To ensure the loop executes, the input read by `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Since `kp` is the loop variable and `range(int(input()))` determines the number of iterations, the input must be at least 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `p` is a permutation of the integers from 0 to n-1 for each test case, `R` is a lambda function that reads and converts a line of input into a list of integers, and the input read by int(input()) must be at least 1**
