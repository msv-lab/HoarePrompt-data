t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*' where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first character of each string is guaranteed to be '.'.
