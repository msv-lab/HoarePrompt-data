You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; n is an input integer. The loop has finished executing, and for each of the n iterations, 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed based on the conditions provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'YES' if neither `a` and `b` are both odd, and `a` is not double `b` and `b` is not double `a`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He tries to cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90° rotation, they are considered the same.

### Conditions:
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to form a different rectangle.
- If \(a/2 == b\) or \(b/2 == a\), it is also impossible to form a different rectangle.
- Otherwise, it is possible to form a different rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
The given program checks these conditions but there are some potential issues:
1. The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect because it uses floating-point division (`/`). This can lead to precision issues and incorrect results when \(a\) and \(b\) are large integers. Instead, it should use integer division (`//`).
2. The program correctly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
3. The program should also handle the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are equal, which is not explicitly handled in the given code. If \(a == b\), it is possible to form a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging (e.g., a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 2x1 rectangles and rearranged into a 1x4 rectangle).

### Corrected Conditions:
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, print "NO".
- If \(a == b\), print "YES".
- If \(a \% 2 == 0\) or \(b \% 2 == 0\) (i.e., at least one of them is even), print "YES".

### Potential Issues:
- The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` should be `elif a // 2 == b or b // 2 == a:`.
- The case `a == b` should be explicitly handled to print "YES".

### Test Cases:
Let's consider some test cases:
1. \(a = 1, b = 1\): Both are odd, so "NO".
2. \(a = 2, b = 1\): One is even, so "YES".
3. \(a = 2, b = 6\): One is even, so "YES".
4. \(a = 3, b = 2\): One is even, so "YES".
5. \(a = 2, b = 2\): Both are equal, so "YES".
6. \(a = 2, b = 4\): One is even, so "YES".
7. \(a = 6, b = 3\): One is even, so "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where \(a == b\) and it uses floating-point division which can lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where \(a == b\) correctly and uses floating-point division which can lead to incorrect results for large integers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
