### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the original assessment using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Sum Calculation:
The original program calculates the sum as follows:
```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```
This formula simplifies to:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - (i-1)^2 \cdot i \]
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \]
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \]
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \]

However, the correct maximum sum for the matrix is:
\[ \text{max\_sum} = n^2 \cdot \frac{n + 1}{2} \]
This is because each row and column should contain distinct integers from 1 to \( n \), and there are \( n \) rows, each contributing to the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. Therefore, the total sum is:
\[ \text{max\_sum} = n \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \]

The original program does not correctly calculate this sum.

#### Operations:
The original program prints the following operations:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```
These operations are supposed to fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum. However, the operations do not ensure that each row and column contains distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). The operations described in the program repeatedly apply the same permutation to rows and columns, which does not guarantee the correct filling of the matrix.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
