### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the problem and the program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - In each game, the winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0 points.
   - In case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
   - The total points for all games are the sum of points of the three players.
   
2. **Objective**:
   - Find the maximum number of draws possible given the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` of the three players.
   - If the scores cannot be achieved through a valid set of games, return `-1`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`
   - The sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` must be even because every game contributes either `2` points (if there's a winner) or `2` points (if it's a draw).
   - The maximum number of draws is determined by the minimum of the total points divided by `2` (total games played) and the sum of the lowest two scores `(p1 + p2)`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Validation**:
   - It first checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If it's not, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have a valid set of games that results in an odd total score.
   - If the sum is even, it calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the total number of games played (since each game contributes `2` points).

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `x` (total games) and `a + b` (sum of the lowest two scores). This is because the sum of the lowest two scores represents the maximum number of games where the third player could not have participated (and thus, the maximum number of draws involving the lowest two players).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated maximum number of draws for each test case.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the validation step by checking if the sum of scores is even. It then correctly calculates the maximum possible number of draws by taking the minimum of the total number of games and the sum of the lowest two scores. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
