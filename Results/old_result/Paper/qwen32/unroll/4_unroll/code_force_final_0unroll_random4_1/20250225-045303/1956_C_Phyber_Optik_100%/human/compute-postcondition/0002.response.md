Output State: **After processing all test cases, the program will have printed the results for each test case. Each test case will output the sum calculated in the loop and the value n + n, followed by 2n lines describing specific row operations on an n Ã— n matrix filled with zeroes. The state of the input variable `t` and the loop counter `_` will not be preserved as they are local to the loop. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last test case processed, and the variable `sum` will hold the sum calculated for that last test case.**
