Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeroes using Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
- **Operations**:
  - **Type 1**: Assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \leq j \leq n \) where \( p \) is a permutation of \( 1 \) to \( n \).
  - **Type 2**: Assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \leq j \leq n \) where \( p \) is a permutation of \( 1 \) to \( n \).
- **Constraints**: Use no more than \( 2n \) operations.
- **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on the formula provided and prints this sum along with `2n`.
- It then prints `2n` lines, each describing row operations on the matrix.

### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness**: **False**
- **Explanation**:
  - The sum calculation is incorrect.
  - The operations do not correctly fill the matrix to maximize the sum.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula `sum = 1` and then adds `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - This formula is incorrect.
   - The maximum sum can be achieved by filling each row with distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Since there are `n` rows, the total sum would be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints `n + n` operations, which is correct in terms of the number of operations.
   - However, the operations themselves are not correctly described. The program prints the same permutation for each row and column, which does not ensure that each row and column contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because:
- The sum calculation is incorrect.
- The operations do not correctly fill the matrix to maximize the sum.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
