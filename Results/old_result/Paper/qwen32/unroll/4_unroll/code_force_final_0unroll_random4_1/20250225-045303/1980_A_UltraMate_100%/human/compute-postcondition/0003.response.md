Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, the function returns a specific output based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `a`.**
