The variable `p` is assigned the value `2`. The values of the other variables (`num`, `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, `Lowest_Prime`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `True` values with length `num + 1` except `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` are `False`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `0` values with length `num + 1`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `0` values with length `num + 1`; `p` is 2.**
