Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply outputs `k - 1` for each test case, regardless of the input values for `n` and the list of card numbers. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left at the end of the process depends on the number of cards with the same value and the value of `k`. The provided program does not take into account the distribution of card numbers or the operations that can be performed. It should analyze the frequency of each card number and determine the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations optimally.

Correctness: **False**
