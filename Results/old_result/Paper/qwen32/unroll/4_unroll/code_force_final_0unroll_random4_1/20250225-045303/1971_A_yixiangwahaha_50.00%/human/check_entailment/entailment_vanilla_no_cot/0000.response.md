Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it assumes there will always be exactly 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t` which is the actual number of test cases. The program should use the value of `t` to determine the number of iterations for reading input and processing test cases, not a fixed number like 10.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):  # Iterate over the number of test cases
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        # Print the minimum and maximum of x and y
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))

# Call the function to execute the program
func()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through `t` test cases, correctly printing the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case.
