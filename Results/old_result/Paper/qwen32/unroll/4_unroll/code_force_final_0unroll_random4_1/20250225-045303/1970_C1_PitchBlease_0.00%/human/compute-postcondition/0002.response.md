The `while` loop in the provided code will execute as long as `queue` is not empty. The loop head only involves the `queue` variable. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that `queue` contains at least one element.

Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. This means that `queue` is already not empty, and thus the loop can execute at least once. No adjustments are needed to the state of `queue` or any other variable for the loop to execute.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n. `tree` is a dictionary or a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with n nodes. `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`.**
