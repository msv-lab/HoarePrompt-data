Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's analyze why the code is incorrect and provide a counterexample.

The current code logic is as follows:
1. It iterates through the list of friends.
2. It checks if a friend and their best friend form a mutual best friendship (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`).
3. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
4. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

This logic is flawed because:
- It does not account for all possible configurations of mutual best friendships.
- It incorrectly assumes that if no mutual best friendship is found, the answer is always `3`.

Let's consider a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
4
2 3 4 1

Output:
3
```

According to the problem description, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2, and both of them will attend because:
- Friend 1 and friend 2 are best friends.
- Friend 2 and friend 3 are best friends.
- Friend 3 and friend 4 are best friends.
- Friend 4 and friend 1 are best friends.

By inviting friends 1 and 2, friends 1 and 2 will attend. Thus, the minimum number of invitations needed is `2`, not `3`.

Another counterexample:
```
Input:
1
5
3 1 2 5 4

Output:
2
```

This is correct based on the problem description. However, the code might not handle all configurations correctly.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Identifying all mutual best friendships.
2. Using a graph-based approach to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Given the current implementation, it is not guaranteed to work for all cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
