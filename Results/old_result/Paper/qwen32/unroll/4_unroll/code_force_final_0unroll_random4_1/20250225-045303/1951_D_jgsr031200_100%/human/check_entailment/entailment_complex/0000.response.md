### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The program includes a function `func_1` that handles the logic for each test case.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Base Case Handling**:
    - If `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES", then prints `1` (number of stalls) and `1` (price of the single stall). This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `n` coins and the stall price is `1`.
    - If `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than she can afford.

2. **General Case Handling**:
    - The program initializes `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`. It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall and adjusts the remaining coins `n` accordingly.
    - The logic seems to be flawed because it only considers two stall prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`), which is insufficient to handle all cases where `n > k`. Specifically, it does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought equals `k` using at most 60 stalls with different prices.

3. **Flawed Logic**:
    - The program does not guarantee that it will find a configuration of at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It only tries two prices and may not be able to reach the exact number of jewels `k`.
    - For example, in the third test case, the program should be able to find a configuration of 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]` to make Alice buy exactly 8 jewels. However, the current implementation does not ensure this.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that it can find a valid configuration of at most 60 stalls with different prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

### Correctness:
**False**
