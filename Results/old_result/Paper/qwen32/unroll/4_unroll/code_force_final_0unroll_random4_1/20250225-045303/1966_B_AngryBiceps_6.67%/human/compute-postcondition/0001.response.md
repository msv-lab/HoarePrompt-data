Output State: **The output state consists of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, the response is 'NO' if either the first row is uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') and different from the last row, or if the first column is uniform and different from the last column. Otherwise, the response is 'YES'. The values of t, n, m, a, first_row, and last_row are not preserved between test cases.**
