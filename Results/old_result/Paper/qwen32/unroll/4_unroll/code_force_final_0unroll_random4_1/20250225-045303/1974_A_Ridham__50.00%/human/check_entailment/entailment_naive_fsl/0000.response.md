Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when it comes to efficiently placing the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Calculation of Remaining Cells**:
   - The code calculates `remaining_cells` after placing the 2x2 icons as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This calculation is correct in the sense that it determines how many 1x1 cells are left after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - However, the code does not account for the fact that the remaining cells might not form a complete 5x3 grid. For example, if you place a 2x2 icon in the top-left corner, you will have 11 cells left, but these cells are not necessarily contiguous and can be spread across multiple screens.

2. **Handling of Extra Space**:
   - The code calculates `extra_space` as `space_x - remaining_cells`. This is correct in the sense that it determines how many additional 1x1 cells need to be placed after the remaining cells from the 2x2 icons are filled.
   - However, the calculation of `extra_screen` is incorrect. The code checks if `space_x % 15 == 0` and then calculates `extra_screen` as `space_x // 15` or `extra_space // 15 + 1`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the remaining cells that could be used on the last screen with 2x2 icons.

3. **Example of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the input `x = 11` and `y = 2`. The code will first place the 2x2 icons, which will occupy 8 cells and leave 7 cells on the first screen. The remaining 4 cells will be on the second screen. The remaining 11 cells need to be placed, but the code will incorrectly calculate the number of additional screens needed.
   - The correct approach would be to place the 2x2 icons first and then place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells, considering the layout of the grid.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        screens += y // 2
        if y % 2 == 1:
            screens += 1
            x -= 3  # Place one 2x2 icon and 3 1x1 icons on the same screen
        
        # Place remaining 1x1 icons
        while x > 0:
            if x >= 15:
                screens += 1
                x -= 15
            elif x >= 11:
                screens += 1
                x -= 11
            elif x >= 7:
                screens += 1
                x -= 7
            elif x >= 3:
                screens += 1
                x -= 3
            elif x >= 1:
                screens += 1
                x -= 1
        
        result.append(screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the 1x1 icons are placed efficiently after the 2x2 icons, considering the layout of the grid.
