Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines the number of contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` that contain at least `k` elements from list `b`. It outputs the count of such subarrays for each test case.**
