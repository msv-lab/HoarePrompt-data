After the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `x`, `y`, and `r` will be populated with integers obtained from the input. Each index `i` of these lists will contain the corresponding values read from the input. The other variables (`visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`) will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `y` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `r` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `False`; `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `None`; `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `None`; `nodes` is an empty list.**
