You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())

            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are even. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Score Comparison**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), it implies that the player with `p3` could have won all the games against the other two players. In this case, the maximum number of draws is the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), as all other games could have ended in draws between the other two players.

4. **Draw Calculation**:
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program calculates the possible number of draws using a loop.
   - It calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws (`cur`) such that the remaining points for `p1` and `p2` could be distributed in a way that is consistent with the total points being even and the scores being achievable through a series of games.
   - If a valid number of draws is found, it prints the total number of draws (`p1 - cur + p3`).
   - If no valid number of draws is found in the loop, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness Analysis

- The program correctly handles the case where the total points are odd, outputting `-1` as required.
- It correctly handles the case where `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, outputting `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
- The loop for calculating the number of draws seems to be designed to find a valid distribution of points, but it needs careful verification to ensure it covers all possible scenarios correctly.

However, there is a potential issue with the loop logic. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` might not cover all cases correctly. For example, if `p1` is much smaller than `p2`, the loop might not find a valid number of draws even if one exists.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program seems to handle most cases correctly but might have issues with the loop logic in certain edge cases. However, based on the provided examples and the logic described, it appears to be generally correct. To be absolutely certain, more thorough testing would be needed, but based on the provided examples, it seems to work as intended.
