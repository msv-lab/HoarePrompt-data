Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` which is an integer representing the number of test cases (where 1 <= t <= 1000), and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 50) and a string `path` of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', with the first character guaranteed to be '.'. The function returns the result for each test case based on the characters in the `path` string.**
