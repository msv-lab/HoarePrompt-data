To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given code. The code processes multiple test cases where, for each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between two lists of integers `a` and `b` under specific conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `n` and `m` are read as the sizes of the two lists `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - List `a` is read and sorted in ascending order.
   - List `b` is read and sorted in descending order.

2. **Processing:**
   - The code then iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and `b` in a specific manner:
     - It compares the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` in their sorted order.
     - If at any point the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element in `b` from the end (`b[-(n - i)]`) is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it switches to using elements from the end of `b` for the rest of the comparisons.
     - It accumulates the minimum absolute differences in the list `ans`.

3. **Output:**
   - Finally, the code prints the sum of the list `ans`, which represents the total of the minimum absolute differences calculated.

Given that the code processes multiple test cases, the output state after all iterations will be a series of sums, one for each test case.

**Output State: **A series of sums, each representing the total of the minimum absolute differences for each test case.**

Since the exact input values are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical sums. However, the output will be in the form of multiple lines, each line containing the sum for a respective test case.

For example, if there are two test cases, the output might look like:
```
Sum for Test Case 1
Sum for Test Case 2
```

Thus, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **A series of sums, each representing the total of the minimum absolute differences for each test case.**
