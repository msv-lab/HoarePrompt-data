Let's go through the code step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and example.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines, which is suitable for handling large inputs efficiently.
   - `func_2()` reads and returns an integer from the input.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.
   - `func_4()` handles the main logic for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` based on the possible directions of the throw:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`c == '0'`) or unknown (`c == '?'`), it calculates the new player position as `(q + r) % n`.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`c == '1'`) or unknown (`c == '?'`), it calculates the new player position as `(q - r) % n`.
   - After processing all throws, it checks if `0` is in the set `ans` (which would indicate an invalid player position due to modulo operation) and corrects it by adding `n` to the set.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Correctness Check

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The modulo operation ensures that the player positions are within the range `[0, n-1]`.
  - The check for `0` in the set `ans` and replacing it with `n` ensures that the player numbers are in the correct range `[1, n]`.

- **Unknown Directions:**
  - When the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), the program considers both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities, which is correct according to the problem description.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of sets to store possible positions ensures that each position is unique and can be updated efficiently.
  - The program processes each test case in linear time relative to the number of throws `m`, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
