To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `while n:`. This loop will execute as long as `n` is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy.

Given that `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to execute at least once.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `n`.
2. **Determine the Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is truthy, which means `n` should be a non-zero integer.
3. **Adjust the State**: Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero. We can specify that `n` must be a non-zero integer.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer. The state of `s` and the coordinates of the squares do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

**State**: **`n` must be a non-zero integer; `s` is calculated and printed for each test case based on the formula `s += (l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2`; the initial state of the coordinates of the squares is not affected by this code.**
