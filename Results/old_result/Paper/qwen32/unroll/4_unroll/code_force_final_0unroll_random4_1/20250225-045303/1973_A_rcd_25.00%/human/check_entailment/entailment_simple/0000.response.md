**Reasoning:**

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking the feasibility of the scores and calculating the maximum number of draws based on the provided conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. Since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, 1 to each in case of a draw, or 0 to the loser and 2 to the winner), the total points must be even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` indicating that the scores are not possible.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score can be achieved by having all other games end in draws, and the remaining points can be distributed to achieve the scores `p1` and `p2`.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program calculates the possible range of draws and iterates through it to find the maximum number of draws that satisfy the conditions. It checks if the remaining points after accounting for the draws can be distributed between `p1` and `p2` in a valid manner.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as no games played (`0 0 0`) and impossible scores (`1 1 1`).

After analyzing the logic, the program seems to correctly implement the conditions and constraints given in the problem statement. It checks for the feasibility of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws accurately.

**Correctness: True**
