### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program code.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange these to form a different rectangle. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90Â° rotation of the other.

#### Conditions:
1. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to form a different rectangle because any cut will result in rectangles with at least one even side, and rearranging these even-sided rectangles will not yield a new rectangle.
2. If \(a\) is double \(b\) or \(b\) is double \(a\), it is impossible to form a different rectangle because the only possible rearrangement will yield the same rectangle.
3. Otherwise, it is possible to form a different rectangle.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
1. The program reads the number of test cases \(n\).
2. For each test case, it reads \(a\) and \(b\).
3. It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO".
4. It checks if \(a\) is double \(b\) or \(b\) is double \(a\) using floating-point division. If so, it prints "NO".
5. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Issues:
1. **Floating-point Division**: The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` uses floating-point division (`/`). This can lead to precision issues, especially with large integers. It should use integer division (`//`).
2. **Case \(a == b\)**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where \(a == b\). However, since \(a == b\) implies that neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is odd, and \(a\) is not double \(b\) and \(b\) is not double \(a\), the program will correctly print "YES" in this case.

#### Corrected Conditions:
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, print "NO".
- If \(a // 2 == b\) or \(b // 2 == a\), print "NO".
- Otherwise, print "YES".

#### Test Cases:
Let's verify the test cases with the corrected conditions:
1. \(a = 1, b = 1\): Both are odd, so "NO".
2. \(a = 2, b = 1\): One is even, so "YES".
3. \(a = 2, b = 6\): One is even, so "YES".
4. \(a = 3, b = 2\): One is even, so "YES".
5. \(a = 2, b = 2\): Both are equal, so "YES".
6. \(a = 2, b = 4\): One is even, so "YES".
7. \(a = 6, b = 3\): One is even, so "YES".

#### Conclusion:
The primary issue with the provided program is the use of floating-point division. However, the original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not handle the case where \(a == b\). In fact, the program will correctly print "YES" for \(a == b\) since neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is odd, and \(a\) is not double \(b\) and \(b\) is not double \(a\).

### Final Evaluation:
The program is mostly correct but can be improved by using integer division. Given the original assessment's claim that the program does not handle the case where \(a == b\), this is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: **True**

The program is correct in its logic and will produce the correct output for the given problem description, except for the potential issue with floating-point division, which does not affect the correctness of the output for the given constraints.
