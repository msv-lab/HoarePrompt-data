### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not accurately determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. The logic in the program is insufficient to handle all cases. Let's break down the issues and provide a counterexample to further illustrate why the program is incorrect.

#### Program Logic Analysis:
1. **First Row Check:**
   - The program checks if all characters in the first row are the same (`len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and if the first row is different from the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`). If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".
   
2. **First Column Check:**
   - The program checks if all characters in the first column (`first_row`) are the same (`len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and if the first column is different from the last column (`first_row != last_row`). If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".
   
3. **Default Case:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES".

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
WBW
BWB
WBW
```

For this grid:
- The first row is "WBW", which is not uniform.
- The last row is also "WBW", so the first condition is not met.
- The first column is "WBW", which is not uniform.
- The last column is also "WBW", so the second condition is not met.

Since neither condition is met, the program will print "YES". However, it is impossible to make all squares the same color using the described operations because the 'W's and 'B's are interwoven in such a way that no single operation can transform the entire grid into a single color.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the grid can be made the same color, the program would need to check if all 'W's or all 'B's can be connected in such a way that they can be transformed into each other using the described operations. This involves more complex logic, such as checking for connected components of the same color.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
