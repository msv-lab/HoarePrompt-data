Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling of k > n and k == n**: The program correctly handles these cases by printing `n` and `k-1` respectively. However, these are edge cases and do not cover the general problem logic.

2. **Frequency Table Creation**: The `func_1` function correctly creates a frequency table where each value is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`. However, this table does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

3. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The program's logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed. It checks if `k` is in the frequency table values and prints `k-1` if true, otherwise prints `n`. This approach does not consider the actual operations that can be performed to minimize the number of cards.

The correct approach to solve the problem is to use the frequency of each card and determine how many cards can be reduced using the given operations. Specifically, for each unique card number, if its frequency is `f`, you can reduce the number of cards by `f // k` times, each time reducing the count by `k-1`. The remaining cards will be `f % k`. The sum of these remainders across all unique card numbers will give the minimum number of cards left.

Here is the corrected logic:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    remaining_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        remaining_cards += count % k
    
    # If remaining_cards is 0, we need to leave at least one card
    if remaining_cards == 0:
        remaining_cards = 1
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

Given the provided program does not implement this logic, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
