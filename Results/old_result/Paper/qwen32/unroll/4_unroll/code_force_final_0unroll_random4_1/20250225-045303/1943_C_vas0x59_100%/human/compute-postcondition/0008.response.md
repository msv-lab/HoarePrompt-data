The code snippet creates a new list `path_ba` and assigns it the value of a list containing the single element `b`. This does not affect the values of `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, or `b` themselves, only introduces a new list `path_ba`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the 0-based indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs(a)` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex as computed by the `bfs(a)` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
