You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid and Diagonals**: 
   - We have an `n x n` grid.
   - There are a total of `4n - 2` diagonals in the grid. This includes both main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom-left) and all the diagonals parallel to them.
   
2. **Objective**:
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - For `k <= 2n`, the optimal strategy is to place one colored cell per diagonal, but since diagonals overlap, we can place cells in such a way that we minimize the number of cells. This is why the formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` works here.
   - For `k > 2n`, we need to cover more diagonals, and the formula `k // 2 + 1` helps in determining the minimum number of cells needed. This accounts for the fact that we can cover more diagonals by placing cells in overlapping positions.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the given program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the grid) and `k` (minimum number of diagonals).

2. **Handling Special Case**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because we only need to color one cell to cover one diagonal.

3. **Handling `k <= 2n`**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2n`, the program outputs `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because we can cover `k` diagonals by coloring `ceil(k / 2)` cells, given the overlapping nature of diagonals.

4. **Handling `k > 2n`**:
   - If `k` is greater than `2n`, the program outputs `k // 2 + 1`. This formula accounts for the fact that we need to cover more diagonals and the additional cells required due to the increased number of diagonals.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover at least `k` diagonals. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both small and large values of `k`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
