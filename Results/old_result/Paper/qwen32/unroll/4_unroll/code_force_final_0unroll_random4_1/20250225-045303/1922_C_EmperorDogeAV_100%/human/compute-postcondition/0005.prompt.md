You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n), n is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of cities in the corresponding sublist of cities, and for each city, the closest city is uniquely determined. The length of cities and n is equal to the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4). The sum of the lengths of all sublists in cities does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, there are m queries (1 <= m <= 10^5), and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n_i; x_i != y_i). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of length `n_i - 1` where each element is either 1 (if the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer). All other variables remain unchanged.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which is a list of length `n_i - 1` where each element is either 1 (if the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `cities`, a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and `n`, a list of integers where each integer represents the number of cities in the corresponding sublist of `cities`. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum travel cost between pairs of cities based on the given constraints and returns a list `prog_cities` for each test case. This list contains elements that are either 1 (indicating the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `prog_cities` which is a list of length `n_i - 1` where each element is either 1 (if the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
