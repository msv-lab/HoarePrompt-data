Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it computes scores for two entities, Bodya and Sasha, based on the values in `a` and the indices in `p`, adjusted by `k`. It then prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal.**
