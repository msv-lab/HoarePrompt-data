#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000. a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. b is a list of n integers where each b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`; `suff` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` and all subsequent elements in `c` up to `c[n-1]`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `ans` is the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `suff` remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for all i from 0 to n-1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in lists `a` and `b`), `k` (an integer), and two lists `a` and `b` (each containing `n` integers). It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` from index `i` to the end of the list.
