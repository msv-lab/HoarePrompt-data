### Reasoning:

The given problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices, \(p_i \oplus p_j\), is maximized. The problem allows us to make queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for sending a query to the system and receiving the result. It takes four indices and prints a query in the format `? a b c d`. It then reads and returns the response (`<`, `=`, or `>`).
   - This function works as expected based on the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).
   - **Step 1**: It identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation \(p\). This is done by comparing each element with the current maximum element using the query `? max_item_idx max_item_idx i i`. If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
   - **Step 2**: It then tries to find the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the highest result. It does this by comparing `? max_item_idx pair_idx max_item_idx i`. If the response is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`. If the response is `=`, it makes another query `? pair_idx pair_idx i i` to break the tie by comparing the element with itself.
   - **Step 3**: It prints the indices of the maximum element and the element that maximizes the XOR with it in the format `! max_item_idx pair_idx`.

### Issues with the Approach:
- The goal is to maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\). The current approach finds the maximum element and then tries to find the smallest element that maximizes the XOR with the maximum element. However, the smallest element does not necessarily maximize the XOR with the maximum element. The correct approach should be to find the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the highest result, which might not necessarily be the smallest element.
- The second loop in `func_2` is flawed because it only considers elements that are smaller than the current `pair_idx` when the response is `=`. It should consider both larger and smaller elements to ensure the correct result.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the current implementation of `func_2` does not guarantee finding the correct pair of indices that maximize the XOR. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
