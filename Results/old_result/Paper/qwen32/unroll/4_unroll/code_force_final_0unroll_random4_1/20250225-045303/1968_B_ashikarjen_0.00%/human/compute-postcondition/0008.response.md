Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b` respectively, followed by the binary strings `a` and `b`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the comparison or processing of the binary strings `a` and `b`.**
