The code snippet creates a list `g` of empty lists, with the length of the list being `n + 1`. This list `g` will be used to represent an adjacency list for the graph (tree in this context). The values of `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree, and `g` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.**
