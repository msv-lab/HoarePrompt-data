To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `num_tests > 0` is satisfied. The variable `t` is not part of the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted. The only variable we can and need to adjust is `num_tests`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.

The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `num_tests` is greater than 0. Since `num_tests` is an input integer, we need to ensure that the input value satisfies this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
