Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. If it's impossible, the function should return -1.

Here's the provided program:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` keeps track of the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` keeps track of the current element being compared.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` to find the minimum length of such sequences.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, the length of the previous sequence (`same`) is compared with `minn`, and `minn` is updated if `same` is smaller.
   - `num` is updated to the current element `ar[i]`, and `same` is reset to 1.
   - The loop increments `i` twice in the `else` block, which is incorrect because it skips elements.

3. **Final check**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time to account for the last sequence.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or `minn` equals the length of the array (`len(ar)`), it means all elements are the same or no sequence was found, so the function prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues:
- The loop increments `i` twice in the `else` block, which causes it to skip elements. This is incorrect.
- The program does not handle all cases correctly, especially when the array contains sequences of identical elements interspersed with different elements.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 2
```
The program will incorrectly output `1` because it skips elements and does not correctly calculate the minimum sequence length.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle cases where the sequence of identical elements is interspersed with different elements due to the incorrect increment of `i`. This leads to incorrect calculations of the minimum sequence length, and thus, incorrect results.
