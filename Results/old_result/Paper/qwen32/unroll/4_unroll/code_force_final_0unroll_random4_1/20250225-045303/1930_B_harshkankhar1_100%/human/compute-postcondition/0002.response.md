To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the state of the list `a` before the `print(*a)` statement is executed. According to the initial state, `a` is a list where the elements at even indices are reversed compared to the original list. However, the original list is not explicitly provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `a`.

Let's break down the given information:

1. There are multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, there is an integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation `p`.
3. `a` is a list derived from `p` where the elements at even indices are reversed.

Since the original list `p` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `a`. However, we can describe the structure of `a` based on the given information.

For example, if the original list `p` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then the list `a` would be `[5, 2, 1, 4, 3]` because the elements at even indices (0 and 2) are reversed.

Given the lack of specific values for `p`, the best we can do is to describe the output in terms of the structure of `a`.

Output: **a (where a is the list derived from the permutation p with elements at even indices reversed)**
