Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The goal is to find the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given two options:
- Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
- Buy two yogurts for `b` burles.

For each test case, the program:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `n > 1`, it calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1` is the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually, which is `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
4. It prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
5. If `n == 1`, it simply prints `a` because no promotion can be applied.

The logic is correct for the following reasons:
- When `n > 1`, the program considers both the option of buying yogurts individually and the option of buying them in pairs where possible, taking the minimum of the two.
- When `n == 1`, the program correctly handles this edge case by printing `a`, as no pairs can be formed.

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

1. For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9`
   - Minimum cost is `9`, which matches the expected output.

2. For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
   - Minimum cost is `15`, which matches the expected output.

3. For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 21`
   - Minimum cost is `15`, which matches the expected output.

4. For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22`
   - Minimum cost is `20`, which matches the expected output.

The program correctly handles all the given test cases, and the logic is sound for the problem description.

Therefore, the response is:
Correctness: **True**
