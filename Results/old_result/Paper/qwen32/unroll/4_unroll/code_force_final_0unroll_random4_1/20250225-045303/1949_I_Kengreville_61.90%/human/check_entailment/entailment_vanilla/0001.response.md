Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if the radii of the disks can be changed such that:
1. Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other.
2. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a graph-based approach where each disk is a node and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent to each other. The program then performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) on this graph to check if it's possible to adjust the radii while maintaining tangency and decreasing the total sum of radii.

#### Key Components:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of disks and their respective coordinates and radii.
2. **Graph Construction**: The program implicitly constructs a graph where two nodes (disks) are connected if the disks are tangent.
3. **DFS Traversal**: The program uses DFS to traverse the graph and checks if it's possible to adjust the radii while maintaining the tangency condition and decreasing the total sum of radii.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are defined in `func_1` but used in `dfs`. This can lead to issues since `dfs` does not have access to these variables unless they are declared as global or passed as parameters.
2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is defined but not included in the provided code snippet. This could be a significant issue if the function is not correctly implemented.
3. **Logic for Radius Adjustment**: The logic for adjusting the radii seems to be based on coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`), but it's not clear how these coefficients are used to ensure the sum of radii decreases while maintaining tangency.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the program (missing global variable declarations, incomplete DFS function, and unclear logic for radius adjustment), it is not clear if the program correctly solves the problem as described. The provided code snippet alone is insufficient to determine the correctness of the program.

However, if we assume that the `dfs` function is correctly implemented and the global variables are properly handled, the logic seems to be attempting to check if there exists a way to adjust the radii while maintaining tangency and decreasing the total sum of radii. But without the complete and correct implementation, we cannot be certain.

Given the provided code snippet, the correctness cannot be definitively determined. Therefore, based on the given information, the program appears to be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
