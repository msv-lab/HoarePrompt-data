You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of integers in the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers). It returns the integer `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the count of iterations where the cumulative sum from the start or the end of the list `nums` is less than or equal to `k // 2` and `math.ceil(k / 2)` respectively.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of ships that would be sunk after the Kraken's attacks. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect.

The function `func_1` calculates `a` and `b` as the number of attacks on the first and last ships respectively, and then it tries to determine how many ships would be sunk by summing up their durability until the sum exceeds `a` or `b`. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. The variables `a` and `b` are calculated as `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively. This is incorrect because it assumes that the number of attacks on the first and last ships are exactly half of `k`, but in reality, the number of attacks on the first and last ships could be different if `k` is odd.
2. The logic of incrementing `ans` based on the cumulative sum of the first and last ship's durability is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and the sinking of ships.
3. The function does not correctly simulate the removal of ships from the list once they sink, which affects the subsequent attacks.

A correct approach would involve simulating the attacks while keeping track of the ships that have sunk. Since `k` can be very large, a more efficient approach would be to use a priority queue or a similar data structure to keep track of the ships with the lowest durability and simulate the attacks until all ships are sunk or the number of attacks reaches `k`.

Given the issues in the provided code, the program is incorrect.
