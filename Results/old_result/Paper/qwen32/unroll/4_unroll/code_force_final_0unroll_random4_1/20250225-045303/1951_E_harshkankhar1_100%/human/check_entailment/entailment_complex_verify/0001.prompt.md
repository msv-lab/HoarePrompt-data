You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Additionally, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True. If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the current value of `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
    #State: `s` is the input string provided by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`. `x` is not -1, indicating that there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, then the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`. Otherwise, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, and `x` is either 1, `n // 2`, or neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from the user, checks certain conditions based on the characters in the string, and prints specific messages and values depending on those conditions. The function always returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Input:** A string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
2. **Output:** Determine if the string can be partitioned into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. If possible, print "YES", the number of parts `k`, and the partitioned substrings. Otherwise, print "NO".
3. **Constraints:** Multiple test cases, each with a string of length up to 10^6, and the total length of all strings does not exceed 10^6.

### Key Observations:
- If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into one part.
- If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, we need to find a way to partition it into more than one part, where each part is not a palindrome.
- If all characters in `s` are the same, it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.
- If there is at least one character different from the first character, we can attempt to partition the string around that character.

### Analysis of the Program:

#### Function `func_1(s) -> bool`:
- This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
- This function works correctly for checking if a string is a palindrome.

#### Function `func_2()`:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It calculates the length of `s` and initializes `x` to -1.

2. **Checking if the Entire String is Non-Palindrome:**
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[0:]) == False`), it prints "YES", the number of parts as 1, and the string itself.
   - This part works correctly for the case where the entire string is not a palindrome.

3. **Finding a Different Character:**
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
   - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO" because all characters are the same, making it impossible to partition into non-palindrome substrings.
   - This part works correctly for the case where all characters are the same.

4. **Partitioning the String:**
   - If a different character is found, the program checks if the substring starting from the next character (`s[x + 1:]`) is not a palindrome.
   - If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts as 2, and the two substrings (`s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`).
   - If this substring is a palindrome, the program needs to handle the case differently.
   - The current implementation checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2` and prints "NO" in these cases, which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach should be to find a valid partition, which the current implementation does not guarantee for all cases.

### Correctness:
The program handles the cases where the entire string is not a palindrome or all characters are the same correctly. However, the logic for partitioning the string when it is a palindrome and contains different characters is flawed. The program does not guarantee a valid partition in all cases.

For example, consider the string "abacaba". The program might incorrectly print "NO" for this string, even though it can be partitioned into "aba", "c", "aba", which are not palindromes.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
