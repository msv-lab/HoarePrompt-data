### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and check if the program correctly implements the solution to the problem:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads `m` queries.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the closest city for each city in the list.
   - For each city, it checks if the forward city is closer than the backward city.
   - If the forward city is closer, it assigns `1` to the corresponding position in `prog_cities`; otherwise, it assigns the distance to the forward city.
   - The function returns this list `prog_cities`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum array for the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum array for the backward direction (calculated after reversing the cities list).

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it determines the direction of travel (from `a` to `b` or from `b` to `a`).
   - If traveling forward, it calculates the cost using `pref_sum_f`.
   - If traveling backward, it calculates the cost using `pref_sum_b`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The `func_1` function is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it incorrectly assigns the distance to the forward city if the forward city is not closer. According to the problem statement, if the forward city is not closer, it should assign the distance to the backward city, not the forward city.
- The prefix sum arrays are not correctly used to calculate the minimum cost. The prefix sums are supposed to accumulate the cost of traveling from one city to the next using the closest city rule, but the current implementation does not correctly reflect this.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the closest city and calculate the minimum travel cost based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
