To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(*r, sep='\n')`, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list containing the results for each test case.

### Print Statement:
- `print(*r, sep='\n')`
  - The `*r` in the `print` function is a syntax used to unpack the list `r` so that each element of the list is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
  - The `sep='\n'` argument specifies that the elements should be separated by a newline character.

### Analysis:
- Since `r` is a list containing the results for each test case, the `print` statement will output each element of the list `r` on a new line.

### Output:
- The output will be each element of the list `r`, printed one per line.

### Final Output Description:
- The print statement will output each result in the list `r` on a new line.

Output: **Each element of the list `r` will be printed on a new line.**
