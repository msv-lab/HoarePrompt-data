### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program by systematically analyzing the logic and verifying it against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Breakdown

The problem involves determining the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games among three players given their final scores. The constraints and rules of the game are:
- Each game results in either a win (2 points to the winner, 0 to the loser) or a draw (1 point to each player).
- The total points awarded in each game are either 2 (for a win/loss) or 2 (for a draw).
- The scores of the players are provided in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- We need to determine if the scores are possible and, if so, find the maximum number of draws.

#### Key Observations

1. **Total Points Parity**: Since each game awards a total of 2 points, the sum of all players' points must be even. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to achieve these scores, and the output should be -1.
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: To maximize the number of draws, we should minimize the number of win/loss games. The formula used in the code attempts to calculate this:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that the highest score \( p_3 \) does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players by more than necessary, thus minimizing the number of win/loss games.

#### Code Analysis

Let's analyze the code logic:
- The code first reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).
- It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints -1.
- If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the above formula and prints the result.

#### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Sum is 0 (even).
   - No games were played, so the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - **Expected Output**: `0`
   - **Actual Output**: `0`

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Sum is 2 (even).
   - One draw between the second and third player.
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Actual Output**: `1`

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Sum is 3 (odd).
   - Impossible to achieve these scores.
   - **Expected Output**: `-1`
   - **Actual Output**: `-1`

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Sum is 4 (even).
   - Two draws between the players.
   - **Expected Output**: `2`
   - **Actual Output**: `2`

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Sum is 9 (odd).
   - Impossible to achieve these scores.
   - **Expected Output**: `-1`
   - **Actual Output**: `-1`

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Six draws between the players.
   - **Expected Output**: `6`
   - **Actual Output**: `6`

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Two draws between the players.
   - **Expected Output**: `2`
   - **Actual Output**: `2`

#### Detailed Verification of the Formula

Let's break down the formula:
\[
\text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
\]

- **Case 1**: \( v[0] + v[1] \geq v[2] \)
  - \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) = 0\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2]}{2}\)
  - This represents the maximum number of draws possible when the combined scores of the two lower players are at least the score of the highest player.

- **Case 2**: \( v[0] + v[1] < v[2] \)
  - \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) = v[2] - v[0] - v[1]\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - (v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2} = \frac{2(v[0] + v[1])}{2} = v[0] + v[1]\)
  - This represents the maximum number of draws possible when the combined scores of the two lower players are less than the score of the highest player.

#### Conclusion

The code correctly handles all the provided examples and follows the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or if the scores are impossible. The formula used ensures that the highest score \( p_3 \) does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players by more than necessary, thus minimizing the number of win/loss games.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
