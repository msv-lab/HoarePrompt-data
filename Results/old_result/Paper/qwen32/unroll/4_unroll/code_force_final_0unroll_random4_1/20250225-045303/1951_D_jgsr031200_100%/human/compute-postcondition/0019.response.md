Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is `k` (which is a variable, but its exact value is not specified).
- `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1) + k - 1`, and it is given that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Calculating the Values:
1. **Calculate `costs`**:
   - The first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1`. Given `n` is 0, this becomes `0 - k + 1 = 1 - k`.
   - The second element of `costs` is `1`.
   - Therefore, `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`.

2. **Calculate `h`**:
   - `h` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1) + k - 1`.
   - Substituting `n = 0`, this becomes `0 // (0 - k + 1) + k - 1 = 0 // (1 - k) + k - 1`.
   - The value of `h` is dependent on the value of `k`, but the problem states that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. We don't need the exact value of `h` for the print statement.

### The Print Statement:
- The print statement is `print(*costs)`.
- The `*` operator in the print statement unpacks the list `costs` and prints each element separated by a space.

### Output:
- Given `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`, the print statement will output `1 - k` followed by `1`.

Output: **1 - k 1 (where k is the value of k)**
