To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at positions `P_B` and `P_S` respectively in a permutation `p`. The game lasts `k` turns. On each turn, a player's score increases by the value at their current position in the array `a`, and then the player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation `p`.

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to simulate the game and calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Let's break down the code and identify any issues:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
   - It initializes the scores `bp` and `sp` with the values from `a` at the starting positions.
   - It also initializes `bm` and `sm` with the scores for `k` turns, assuming the players stay at their starting positions for all turns.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, but it should run `k` times.
   - Inside the loop, it decrements `k` and breaks if `k` becomes 0.
   - It updates the positions `b` and `s` to the positions indicated by the permutation `p`.
   - It incorrectly updates the scores using `max` and accumulates scores in a way that doesn't reflect the game rules.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
   - The lines `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. These lines do not correctly simulate the game rules. The correct approach should be to simply add the value of `a` at the current position to the respective player's score on each turn.
   
2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop should run `k` times, but the decrement of `k` and the break condition are not correctly implemented. The loop condition should be based on the number of turns left, and the decrement should occur after processing each turn.

3. **Initialization of Scores**:
   - The initial scores are set correctly, but the accumulation of scores within the loop is flawed.

### Correct Implementation
A correct implementation should look something like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = 0
        sm = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Final Evaluation
Given the issues identified in the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly simulate the game and calculate the scores as described in the problem statement.

**Final: False**
