Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. The list `c` contains `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, while the conditions for `n`, `k`, and the list `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
