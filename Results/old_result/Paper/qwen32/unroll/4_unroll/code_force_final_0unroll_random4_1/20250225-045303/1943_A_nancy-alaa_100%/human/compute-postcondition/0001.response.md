Output State: **For each test case, the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in the list `a` or appears exactly once in the list `a` after the first occurrence of any integer that appears exactly once will be printed. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variables `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` will not retain their values after each iteration as they are reinitialized in each loop iteration.**
