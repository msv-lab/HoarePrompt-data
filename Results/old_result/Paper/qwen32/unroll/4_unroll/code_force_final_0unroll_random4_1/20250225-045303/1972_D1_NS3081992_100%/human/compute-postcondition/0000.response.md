The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_7()` to the variables `n` and `m`. Given that the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6, after the function call, `n` and `m` will hold the values returned by `func_7()`, which are also positive integers within the same range.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**
