### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using a limited number of operations. The operations involve filling rows and columns with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \).

The solution provided in the annotated program follows these steps:
1. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
2. It initializes the matrix with the identity permutation for each row.
3. It calculates the sum of the matrix elements based on the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\).
4. It prints the calculated sum and the number of operations (which is \( 2n \)).
5. It prints the operations needed to achieve this sum, which are \( n \) Type 1 operations followed by \( n \) Type 2 operations.

Let's analyze the correctness of the solution:
- The sum calculation \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\) seems to be incorrect. The correct sum of the matrix elements should be the sum of all numbers from 1 to \( n \) repeated \( n \) times in each row and column, which is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
- The operations described in the program (Type 1 and Type 2) are valid and ensure that each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). However, the operations do not guarantee that the sum is maximized according to the correct formula.

The correct formula for the sum of all elements in the matrix should be:
\[ \text{Sum} = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]

The number of operations is correctly calculated as \( 2n \).

However, the sum calculation in the program is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not provide the correct maximum sum for the matrix.
