The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by the variable `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `b` does not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `a` is greater than 0.

Since `a` is an integer, we can simply set `a` to any positive integer. For the sake of clarity and simplicity, we can set `a` to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is 1; `b` is a binary string of length `m`.**
