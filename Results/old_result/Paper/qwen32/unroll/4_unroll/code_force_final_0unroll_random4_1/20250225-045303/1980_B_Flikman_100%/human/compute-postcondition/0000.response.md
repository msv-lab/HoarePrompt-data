Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each i from 0 to n-1.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the integer input. The preconditions for `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
