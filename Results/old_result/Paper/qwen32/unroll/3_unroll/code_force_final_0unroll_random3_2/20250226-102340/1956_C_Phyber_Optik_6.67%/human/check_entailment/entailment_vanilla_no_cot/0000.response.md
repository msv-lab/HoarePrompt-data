Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix or the corresponding operations. The logic for calculating the sum and the operations is flawed.

Here's the correct approach to solve the problem:

1. **Maximizing the Sum**: To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to ensure that each row and each column contains the numbers from 1 to n exactly once. This is because the sum of the first n natural numbers is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), and if each row/column contains these numbers, the sum of the entire matrix will be \(n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).

2. **Operations**: We can achieve this by performing \(n\) Type 1 operations (one for each row) and \(n\) Type 2 operations (one for each column). For each Type 1 operation, we can assign the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] to the row. Similarly, for each Type 2 operation, we can assign the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] to the column. This will ensure that each row and each column contains the numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

# Call the function to process input
func()
```

This program correctly computes the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve it.
