Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of length `n`.
- `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- We need to construct a permutation `p` that satisfies the above condition.
- The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` seems to track the smallest unused number, and `maxx` seems to track the largest used number in `mex`.

2. **Loop through `arr`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `arr`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
       - Append `minn` to `mex`.
       - Increment `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, increment `minn` by 1. This part seems incorrect because it unnecessarily increments `minn` if it equals `maxx`. This logic doesn't align with the definition of MEX.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
       - Append `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
       - If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, update `maxx`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of `minn` and `maxx`**: The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` does not correctly reflect the MEX calculation. The program does not accurately determine the smallest unused number in the current permutation.
- **Handling of Negative Values in `arr`**: The program incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` when `arr[i]` is negative. The correct approach should involve finding the smallest unused number that satisfies the equation `a_i = MEX(p_1, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Correct Approach:
- Use a set to keep track of the numbers already used in `p`.
- For each `arr[i]`, calculate the MEX of the current set of used numbers and determine `p_i` based on the equation `a_i = MEX - p_i`.
- Insert the calculated `p_i` into the permutation and update the set of used numbers.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
