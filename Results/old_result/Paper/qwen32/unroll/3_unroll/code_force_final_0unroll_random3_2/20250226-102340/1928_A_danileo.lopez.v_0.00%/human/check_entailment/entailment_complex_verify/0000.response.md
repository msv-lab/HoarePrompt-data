Let's analyze the problem description and the provided code in detail, using the annotated version to validate or challenge the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap
- Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
- He tries to cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- From the two resulting rectangles, he tries to form another rectangle.
- Two rectangles differing only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.
- Determine if Bob can form another rectangle different from the original.

### Key Observations
1. **Even Dimension Case:**
    - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles. These can be rearranged to form a \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangle.
    - If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles. These can be rearranged to form a \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangle.
    - If either dimension is even, Bob can always form a different rectangle.

2. **Odd Dimension Case:**
    - If both `a` and `b` are odd, any cut will result in rectangles with at least one odd dimension.
    - It is impossible to rearrange these rectangles to form a new rectangle different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle.

### Program Analysis
The provided program checks if either `a` or `b` is even:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
### Annotations
The annotations confirm that the program:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, reads dimensions `a` and `b`.
- Prints "Yes" if at least one of `a` or `b` is even.
- Prints "No" if both `a` and `b` are odd.

### Validation of Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies that:
- If either dimension is even, Bob can form another rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle.

### Conclusion
The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and the reasoning provided in the original assessment. The program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle based on the parity of the dimensions `a` and `b`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct.
