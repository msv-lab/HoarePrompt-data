Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each involving a positive integer `x` (where 1 <= x < 2^30). For each test case, it transforms the binary representation of `x` according to specific rules, involving the replacement of consecutive '1's and the handling of a 'flag' state. It then outputs the modified length and the modified binary representation of `x`.**
