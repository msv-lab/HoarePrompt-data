In the provided task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_`, which is a conventional throwaway variable used when the loop variable is not needed. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`.

However, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Given the constraint `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the loop will always execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Thus, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range, and since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
