Postcondition: **The program raises a TypeError because `math.sqrt()` is called with a list instead of a number. `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list. The current value of `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
