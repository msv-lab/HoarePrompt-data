Reasoning: 

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it correctly outputs `-1` because a uniform array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. If the array is not uniform, it tries to find the minimum length of any contiguous subarray where all elements are the same. However, the logic for finding this minimum length is flawed.

The program uses a variable `ans` to store the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. It iterates through the array and updates `cnt` when it encounters elements equal to the first element `val`. When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum length of any contiguous subarray where all elements are the same. Instead, it identifies the minimum length of any contiguous subarray starting from the first element. This is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program will identify the minimum length of any contiguous subarray starting from the first element as `3` (the three consecutive `3`s at the beginning). However, the correct answer is `3` as well, but it should be identified as the minimum length of any contiguous subarray (not necessarily starting from the first element). In this case, the program happens to give the correct answer, but it does not guarantee the correct answer for all possible test cases.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases.

Correctness: **False**
