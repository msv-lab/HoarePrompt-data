The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers for each test case. It then determines and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If `n` is `2`, it always prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `2` if such an index exists, otherwise it prints `3`.
