The provided Python code snippet includes `os.system('cls')`, which is a system call to clear the console screen. This command does not affect the values of the variables `t` or `n` in any way. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.**
