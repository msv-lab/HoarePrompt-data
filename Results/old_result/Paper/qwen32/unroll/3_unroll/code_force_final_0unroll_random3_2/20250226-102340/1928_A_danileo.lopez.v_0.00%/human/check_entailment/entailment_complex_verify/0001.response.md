### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key observation is that if either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it is always possible to form a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces. This is because cutting an even dimension results in two equal smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a new configuration. Conversely, if both dimensions are odd, the only possible cuts result in smaller rectangles of odd dimensions, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

Let's validate this with the annotated code:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
3. **Check Even Condition**: It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
4. **Output Result**: If the condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case and prints the appropriate result based on the evenness of \(a\) or \(b\).

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description. The original assessment is correct.

### Final:
Final: **True**
