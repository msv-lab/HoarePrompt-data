You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
- An array `a` of length `m` is considered "good" if there exists an array `b` of length `m` where:
  1. The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. For every index `i`, `a[i] ≠ b[i]`.
  3. Every element in `b` is greater than 0.
- We need to determine if subarrays of the given array `c` are "good".

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array `c`), `q` (number of queries), and the array `c` itself.
   - It also reads `q` pairs of integers representing the subarray ranges.

2. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an array `b` of length `n + 1` with all zeros.
   - It then iterates over the array `a` (which is the array `c` with a prepended 0 for 1-based indexing).
   - For each element in `a`, it sets `b[i]` to `b[i - 1] + x`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 otherwise.
   - This means `b[i]` will be the sum of `x` values up to index `i`, where `x` is chosen such that `b[i]` will be strictly less than the corresponding sum in `a` if `a[i] > 1`, and `b[i]` will be at least 2 more than the corresponding sum in `a` if `a[i] == 1`.

3. **Calculating Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of `a` using `accumulate` and stores it back in `a`.
   - It also prints the prefix sums of `a`, which is not necessary for the solution and seems to be an error or debugging statement.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray in `a` and `b` using the prefix sums.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if the subarray length is 1. If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Condition for "Good" Array:**
  - The program incorrectly checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` to determine if the subarray is "good".
  - The correct condition should be whether it's possible to construct an array `b` such that the sum of `b` equals the sum of `a`, and all elements of `b` are different from `a` and greater than 0.
  - The current logic does not account for the possibility of constructing such an array `b` correctly.

- **Printing Prefix Sums:**
  - The program prints the prefix sums of `a`, which is unnecessary and seems to be an error or debugging statement.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the logic used to determine if a subarray is "good", the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
