### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

Let's analyze the function `func_1(n, k)`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.

2. **Loop through `n` elements**:
   - For each element in `nums` (except the last one), it sets the element to the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits. This is done using `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which essentially sets all bits up to `k.bit_length() - 1` to 1.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k`.

3. **Adjust the last element**:
   - After the loop, the last element of `nums` is adjusted by adding the remaining value of `k` to it. This ensures that the sum of all elements in `nums` equals `k`.

4. **Return the list**:
   - The function returns the list `nums`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR**:
  - The current implementation does not ensure that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. By setting each element to the largest possible value with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, we are not necessarily maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. For example, if `k` is small and `n` is large, setting each element to a large value will not help in maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
  - A better approach would be to distribute the value of `k` in such a way that the binary OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s. This can be achieved by setting as many elements as possible to 1 (since 1 has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation) and distributing the remaining value optimally.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
