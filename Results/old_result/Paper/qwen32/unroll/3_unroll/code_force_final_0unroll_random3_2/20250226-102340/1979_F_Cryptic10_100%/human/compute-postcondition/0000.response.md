The code snippet defines a lambda function `q` that takes an integer `d` as input, prints a query in the format `"? d"`, flushes the output, and then reads a line of input, splitting it into a list of integers. The function `q` does not modify any variables directly except for the implicit file state of standard input and output.

Since the lambda function `q` is defined but not called, no queries are made, and no input is read or output is produced. Therefore, the state of the variables and the system remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **The function `func()` does not take any input parameters. The interaction with the system is handled through standard input and output as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function will receive multiple test cases, each starting with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph. The function can then make up to `n` queries of the form "? d" (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) to gather information about the graph, and finally output a Hamiltonian path for each test case in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n". The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The lambda function `q` is defined to handle queries but has not been invoked.**
