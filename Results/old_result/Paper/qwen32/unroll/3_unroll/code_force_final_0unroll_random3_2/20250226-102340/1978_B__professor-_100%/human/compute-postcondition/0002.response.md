Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each representing the result of the expression evaluated for each set of `n`, `a`, and `b` read from the input. Specifically, for each iteration, if `b <= a`, the result is `n * a`. If `b - a >= n`, the result is the integer value of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. Otherwise, the result is the integer value of `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state remain unchanged except that `t` iterations of the loop have been executed, and the results have been printed.**
