The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer `n` is not related to the initial state provided, which describes `t` lines of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `n` is introduced by the code and does not affect the pre-existing variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` directly. Since the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it as an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; Each of the following t lines contains three integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively; `n` is an input integer.**
