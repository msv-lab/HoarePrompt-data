Let's analyze the given loop and determine the output state after it executes all iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr).
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(mid):
    arr[left + i] = small_element + i
    cliquess[left + i] = clique
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates `mid` times, where `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- For each iteration `i` from `0` to `mid-1`:
  - `arr[left + i]` is set to `small_element + i`.
  - `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.

### Changes to the Array and Clique Array:
- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` will be set to `small_element`, `small_element + 1`, ..., `small_element + mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` will be set to `clique`.

### Output State:
- `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `arr` will have its elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` updated.
- `cliquess` will have its elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` set to `clique`.

### Formatted Output State:
Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are set to `small_element`, `small_element + 1`, ..., `small_element + mid - 1`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are set to `clique`.**
