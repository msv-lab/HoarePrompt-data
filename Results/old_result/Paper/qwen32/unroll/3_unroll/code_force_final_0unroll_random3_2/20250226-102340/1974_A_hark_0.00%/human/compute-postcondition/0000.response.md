The code snippet `t = int(input())` will read an input from the user, convert it to an integer, and assign it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state already specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the input operation will overwrite the previous value of `t` with the new integer input provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**
