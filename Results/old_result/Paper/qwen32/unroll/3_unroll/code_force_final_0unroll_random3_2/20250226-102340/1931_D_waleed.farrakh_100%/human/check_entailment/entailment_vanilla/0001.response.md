### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to ensure correctness.

**Problem Analysis:**
- We are given an array `a` and two integers `x` and `y`.
- A pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if:
  - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
  - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

**Approach:**
- For each element `a_i` in the array, we need to check how many subsequent elements `a_j` (where `j > i`) form a beautiful pair with `a_i`.
- To efficiently count these pairs, the program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx = (-a_i % x + x) % x` and `ry = a_i % y`.
- For each element `a_i`, the program calculates `rx` and `ry` and checks if `(rx, ry)` has been seen before. If it has, it means there are previous elements that can form a beautiful pair with `a_i`.
- The program updates the frequency of the current pair `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` in the dictionary.

**Key Points:**
- The calculation of `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative and within the range `[0, x-1]`. This is done to handle negative remainders correctly.
- The program uses a single pass through the array for each test case, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case.

**Verification:**
- The sample input-output pairs provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
- The logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound, as it correctly checks the conditions for each pair `(i, j)` using the precomputed remainders.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

**Correctness: **True**
