Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the single round of the game. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True. `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent nodes forming the tree. `ends` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change is that a new variable `ends` is introduced and initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
