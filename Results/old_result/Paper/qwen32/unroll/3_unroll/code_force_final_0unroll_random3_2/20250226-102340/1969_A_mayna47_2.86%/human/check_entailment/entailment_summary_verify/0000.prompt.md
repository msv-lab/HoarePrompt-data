You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers for each test case. It then determines and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If `n` is `2`, it always prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `2` if such an index exists, otherwise it prints `3`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not account for all scenarios where the minimum number of invitations might be more than 2. Let's analyze the code and find a potential case where it does not work as expected.

The code currently checks for the condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i`, which is meant to detect if there is a cycle of length 3 (i.e., a triplet of friends where each friend is the best friend of the next in the cycle). If such a cycle is found, it prints 2 because inviting any two friends in the cycle will result in at least two friends attending the party. However, this is not the only scenario where Monocarp can invite just 2 friends.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
4
2 3 4 1
```
In this case, the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 4. The code will not find a cycle of length 3, so it will fall back to printing 3. However, Monocarp can still invite just 2 friends (e.g., friends 1 and 2) and have both come to the party because friend 1's best friend (friend 2) is invited, and friend 2's best friend (friend 3) is not required to be invited for friend 2 to come. Similarly, friend 2's best friend (friend 3) is invited, and friend 3's best friend (friend 4) is not required to be invited for friend 3 to come. Thus, the correct answer should be 2, not 3.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly, specifically cycles of length greater than 3 where inviting just 2 friends can still result in at least 2 friends attending the party.
