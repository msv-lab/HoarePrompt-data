You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and there are two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

    #State: a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` made up of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines whether there is a valid path based on the arrangement of the characters in the strings and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step against the problem description.

The program is supposed to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) in a 2-row grid, given the directions of arrows in each cell.

The logic in the provided program is as follows:
1. For each test case:
   - Read the number of columns `n`.
   - Read the strings `a` and `b` which represent the directions of arrows in the first and second rows respectively.
2. Check if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[-2]`) does not point to the right (`'>'`). If it does not, print 'NO' because the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row.
3. If `n == 1`, print 'YES' (which seems incorrect as the problem states `n >= 2`).
4. Otherwise, check if there is a path from the start to the end:
   - First, check if all even-indexed cells in the second row point to the right. If any do not, set `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True`, check if all odd-indexed cells in the first row (except the last one) point to the right. If any do not, set `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after both checks, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.

However, this logic has several issues:
- The program incorrectly assumes that the robot can only move right from even-indexed cells in the second row and odd-indexed cells in the first row. This is not the case as the robot can move in any direction (left, right, up, down) and follow the arrow.
- The program does not consider all possible paths the robot could take. It only checks a very specific pattern of movements.
- The condition `elif n == 1` is incorrect as per the problem constraints (`n >= 2`).
- The print statement `print(k)` inside the loop is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem's output requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem based on the provided description.
