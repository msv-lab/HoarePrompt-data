You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each of the t test cases, x and n are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: For each test case, `ans` holds the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or whose corresponding pair divisor (i.e., `x // i`) is less than or equal to `n`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or whose corresponding pair divisor x // ans is less than or equal to n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or whose corresponding pair divisor (i.e., `x // i`) is less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to divide a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems with positive integer difficulties such that the sum of the difficulties equals `x`. The balance of the problemset is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems. We need to find the maximum possible balance.

### Approach:
To maximize the balance, we need to find the largest possible integer `d` such that:
1. `d` divides `x` (i.e., `x % d == 0`).
2. `x // d` (the number of sub-problems with difficulty `d`) is at least `n` or `d` itself is at least `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to find the maximum balance by iterating through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
- It checks if `i` can be a valid balance (i.e., `n <= x // i`).
- It also checks if `x // i` can be a valid balance (i.e., `n <= i`).
- It keeps track of the maximum valid balance found.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `x = 10, n = 3`
   - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - Checking:
     - `i = 1`: `n <= 10 // 1` (True, balance = 1)
     - `i = 2`: `n <= 10 // 2` (True, balance = 2)
     - `i = 5`: `n <= 10 // 5` (False, balance remains 2)
     - `i = 10`: `n <= 10 // 10` (False, balance remains 2)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `x = 5, n = 5`
   - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
   - Checking:
     - `i = 1`: `n <= 5 // 1` (True, balance = 1)
     - `i = 5`: `n <= 5 // 5` (True, balance = 5)
   - Output: `5` (Incorrect, should be `1` because we need exactly 5 sub-problems each of difficulty 1)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `x = 420, n = 69`
   - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
   - Checking:
     - `i = 1`: `n <= 420 // 1` (True, balance = 1)
     - `i = 2`: `n <= 420 // 2` (True, balance = 2)
     - `i = 3`: `n <= 420 // 3` (True, balance = 3)
     - `i = 4`: `n <= 420 // 4` (True, balance = 4)
     - `i = 5`: `n <= 420 // 5` (True, balance = 5)
     - `i = 6`: `n <= 420 // 6` (True, balance = 6)
     - `i = 7`: `n <= 420 // 7` (True, balance = 7)
     - `i = 10`: `n <= 420 // 10` (True, balance = 10)
     - `i = 12`: `n <= 420 // 12` (True, balance = 12)
     - `i = 14`: `n <= 420 // 14` (True, balance = 14)
     - `i = 15`: `n <= 420 // 15` (True, balance = 15)
     - `i = 20`: `n <= 420 // 20` (True, balance = 20)
     - `i = 21`: `n <= 420 // 21` (True, balance = 21)
     - `i = 28`: `n <= 420 // 28` (True, balance = 28)
     - `i = 30`: `n <= 420 // 30` (True, balance = 30)
     - `i = 35`: `n <= 420 // 35` (True, balance = 35)
     - `i = 42`: `n <= 420 // 42` (True, balance = 42)
     - `i = 60`: `n <= 420 // 60` (True, balance = 60)
     - `i = 70`: `n <= 420 // 70` (True, balance = 70)
     - `i = 84`: `n <= 420 // 84` (True, balance = 84)
     - `i = 105`: `n <= 420 // 105` (True, balance = 105)
     - `i = 140`: `n <= 420 // 140` (True, balance = 140)
     - `i = 210`: `n <= 420 // 210` (True, balance = 210)
     - `i = 420`: `n <= 420 // 420` (True, balance = 420)
   - Output: `6` (Correct, because `n = 69` is less than `420 // 6`, and `6` is the maximum valid balance)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the first and third test cases but fails the second test case because it does not correctly handle the case where `n` is equal to `x // d` or `d` itself. This is because the program checks `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` but does not correctly handle the scenario where `n` is exactly equal to one of these values.

**Correctness:** **False**

The program is incorrect due to the handling of the edge case where `n` is exactly equal to `x // d` or `d`.
