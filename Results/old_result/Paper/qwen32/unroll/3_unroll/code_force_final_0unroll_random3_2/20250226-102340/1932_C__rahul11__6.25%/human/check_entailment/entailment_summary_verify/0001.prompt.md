You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a corresponding string of 'L' and 'R' characters. For each test case, it computes a sequence of values based on the product of the integers and the operations specified by the string, and prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Reading Input**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `m` (the modulus).
   - It reads the array `arr` of `n` integers.
   - It reads the string `s` of `n` commands ('L' or 'R').

2. **Initial Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It takes the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - It initializes pointers `l` and `r` to point to the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array, respectively.
   - It iterates through the commands in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it divides the current product `ans` by the element at the left pointer `l`, updates `ans` by taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`, and then updates `res[c]` with the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m`.
     - If the command is 'R', it divides the current product `ans` by the element at the right pointer `r`, updates `ans` by taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`, and then updates `res[c]` with the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m`.
     - It then adjusts the pointers `l` or `r` accordingly and increments the counter `c`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all commands, the program prints the results stored in `res`.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Product Update**: The program attempts to update the product `ans` by integer division (`//`), which is incorrect. The product should be recalculated by removing the specific element, not by integer division.
  
- **Modulo Operation**: The program takes the modulo `MOD` during the product update, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The modulo should only be taken when calculating the final result for each command.

- **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product calculation is correct, but the subsequent updates are incorrect due to the reasons mentioned above.

### Correctness

Given the issues in the program, it does not correctly process the commands and update the product as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
