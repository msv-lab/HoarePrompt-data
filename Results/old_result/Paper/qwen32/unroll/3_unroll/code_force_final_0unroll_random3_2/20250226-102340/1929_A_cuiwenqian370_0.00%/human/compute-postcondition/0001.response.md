Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers of length `n` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the variable `new_arr` has been initialized as an empty list, while `n` and `arr` retain their initial values.
