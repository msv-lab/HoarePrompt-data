Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people `n` in the queue (excluding Kirill), the maximum allowable final position `m` of Kirill in the queue, the list `a` of costs Kirill has to pay to swap places with each person, and the list `b` of additional costs Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th person during a swap. For each test case, the function returns the minimum total cost for Kirill to reach a position no greater than `m` in the queue.**
