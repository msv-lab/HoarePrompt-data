The function reads an integer input, which indicates the number of times to call `func_1()`. It does not directly use or modify the parameters `n` and `a` as described in the annotations. The final state of the program is that `func_1()` is called the specified number of times, but the function itself does not return any value or modify the input parameters `n` and `a`.
