To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling the buns under the given promotion rules.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has `n` buns, each of which can be sold at the usual price `a` or at a modified price. The modified price for the `i-th` bun (where `1 <= i <= k`) is `(b - i + 1)`. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal `k`.

The formula used in the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **When `b <= a`:**
   - Selling all buns at the usual price `a` results in the maximum profit.
   - `n * a` is the total profit.

2. **When `b - a >= n`:**
   - Selling all buns at the modified price results in the maximum profit.
   - The sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, ..., b-n+1)` can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `((2 * b - n + 1) * n) // 2`.

3. **When `b - a < n`:**
   - Selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` results in the maximum profit.
   - The optimal `k` can be derived from the point where the modified price starts to be less than the usual price `a`. This happens when `b - k + 1 <= a` or `k >= b - a + 1`.
   - The total profit is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified price sequence plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified price sequence is `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) // 2`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a` is `a * (n - (b - a))`.

### Program Analysis

The program correctly handles the three cases as described above:

- **Case 1:** When `b <= a`, the profit is simply `n * a`.
- **Case 2:** When `b - a >= n`, the profit is `((2 * b - n + 1) * n) // 2`.
- **Case 3:** When `b - a < n`, the profit is `((b - a) * (b - a + 1)) // 2 + a * (n - (b - a))`.

The program correctly implements these cases and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

**Correctness: True**
