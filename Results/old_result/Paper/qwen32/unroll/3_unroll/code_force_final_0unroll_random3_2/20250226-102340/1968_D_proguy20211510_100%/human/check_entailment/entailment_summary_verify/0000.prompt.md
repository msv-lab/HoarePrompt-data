You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:

    (YES, NO) = ('YES', 'NO')
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    alpha = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for _ in range(int(input())):

            curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
            preb += pathb[i]
            resb = max(resb, curr)

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it evaluates two paths starting from given positions in a list and calculates the maximum possible score based on a given number of steps. It then compares the scores of these two paths and prints the result indicating whether "Bodya" wins, "Sasha" wins, or if it is a "Draw".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic and scoring mechanism as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that players can stay at their current position or move to `p_x` on each turn, and it does not correctly simulate the game for `k` turns.

Here are some issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation**: The program calculates the path for each player by continuously moving to the next position in the permutation until a cycle is detected. This approach does not consider the possibility of staying at the current position, which could lead to a higher score.

2. **Scoring Mechanism**: The program calculates the score by adding the value of `a_x` for each move, but it does not correctly simulate the scenario where a player might choose to stay at the current position to maximize their score. The current implementation assumes that the player will always move to the next position in the permutation, which is not optimal.

3. **Handling of Cycles**: While the program does detect cycles in the permutation, it does not correctly handle the scenario where a player might stay in a cycle to maximize their score. The program simply breaks out of the loop once a cycle is detected, but it does not consider the possibility of staying in the cycle for multiple turns.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: The problem requires both players to try to win, which means they should choose the optimal strategy at each turn. The provided program does not simulate this optimal strategy, as it does not consider the possibility of staying at the current position.

To fix these issues, the program would need to simulate the game for `k` turns, considering both the possibility of moving to `p_x` or staying at the current position, and calculate the optimal score for each player based on their starting position. The current implementation does not account for these factors, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

Here is a potential test case that demonstrates the issue:

```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

Explanation:
- Bodya starts at position 3, with `a_3 = 5`. He can either stay at position 3 or move to position 2.
- Sasha starts at position 2, with `a_2 = 2`. He can either stay at position 2 or move to position 1.
- If Bodya stays at position 3 for both turns, his score will be `5 + 5 = 10`.
- If Sasha moves to position 1 on the first turn, his score will be `2 + 7 = 9`.
- Therefore, Bodya wins.

The provided program does not correctly simulate this scenario, leading to an incorrect output.
