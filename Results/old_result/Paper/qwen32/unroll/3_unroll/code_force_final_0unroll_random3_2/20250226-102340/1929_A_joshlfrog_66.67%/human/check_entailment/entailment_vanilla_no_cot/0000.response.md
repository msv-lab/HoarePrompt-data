Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program is supposed to calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in a specific order to maximize this sum. The correct approach is to sort the array in ascending order and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. 

The given program instead finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and outputs their difference, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem as described.
