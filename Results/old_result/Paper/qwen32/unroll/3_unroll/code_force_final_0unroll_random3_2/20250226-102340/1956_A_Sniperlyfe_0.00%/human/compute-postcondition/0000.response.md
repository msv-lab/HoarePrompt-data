To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variables `n` and `p` as they are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition `n >= min(p)`.

### Analysis:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the initial number of players.
- `p` is a list of positive integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, where each element in `p` is less than or equal to 100.

The loop condition `n >= min(p)` will be true if `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in the list `p`.

### Steps to Ensure Loop Execution:
1. **Ensure `p` is not empty**: Since `min(p)` requires `p` to have at least one element, we need to make sure `p` is not empty.
2. **Adjust `n`**: `n` should be greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`.

### Example Adjustment:
- If `p` is `[5, 10, 3]`, then `min(p)` is `3`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `3` for the loop to execute.

### General Adjustment:
- Since `p` is a list of positive integers, we need to ensure it has at least one element.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the smallest element in `p`.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted such that `p` has at least one element, and `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `p`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= min(p)`, and `p` is a non-empty list of positive integers where each element is less than or equal to 100**.
