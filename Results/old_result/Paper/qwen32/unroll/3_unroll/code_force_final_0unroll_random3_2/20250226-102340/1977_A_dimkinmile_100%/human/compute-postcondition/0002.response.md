The `print('Yes')` statement in the given code snippet will output the string 'Yes', regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`. The precondition provides information about the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `m`, but it does not influence the output of the `print` statement because the statement is hardcoded to print 'Yes'.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`.
2. The string 'Yes' is explicitly provided within the `print` function.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are defined by the precondition but do not affect the print statement since it does not reference these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
