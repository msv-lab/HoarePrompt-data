Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the specified operations. The logic in the program seems to be incorrect, especially the calculation of the power of 2 that is used to determine the final position of 1.

The problem can be solved by observing that the position of 1 in the array after all swaps is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. This is because each swap operation effectively moves 1 to the position of the largest divisor of the current index, and the largest divisor of a power of 2 is another power of 2.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while (1 << power) <= n:
                power += 1
            print(1 << (power - 1))

func()
```

In this corrected version, `1 << power` is used to calculate 2^power, and the loop finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. The final position of 1 is then `1 << (power - 1)`.
