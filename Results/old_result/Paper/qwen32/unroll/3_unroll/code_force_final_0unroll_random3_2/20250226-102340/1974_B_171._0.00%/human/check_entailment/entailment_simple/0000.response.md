Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is intended to decode the encoded string back to the original string. However, the current implementation does not correctly map the encoded characters back to their original characters.

The function `func_1` attempts to create a mapping from the encoded characters to the original characters by assigning the next available character in the alphabet ('a' to 'z') to each new character it encounters in the encoded string. This approach does not respect the specific encoding mechanism described in the problem, which requires using the symmetric character from the string `r`.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **String `r` Construction**: The string `r` is constructed as the sorted list of unique characters from the original string `s`. The encoding process uses the symmetric character from `r` for each character in `s`.

2. **Decoding Process**: To decode, we need to reverse this process. For each character in the encoded string `b`, we need to find its symmetric character in `r` to get the original character.

3. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation does not construct the string `r` or use it to find the symmetric characters. Instead, it assigns the next available character in the alphabet to each new character in the encoded string, which is not the intended decoding process.

4. **Correct Decoding**: The correct decoding process should involve:
   - Constructing the string `r` from the encoded string `b` (this can be done by identifying the unique characters in `b` and sorting them).
   - Creating a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Using this mapping to decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly decode the encoded string, and thus the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
