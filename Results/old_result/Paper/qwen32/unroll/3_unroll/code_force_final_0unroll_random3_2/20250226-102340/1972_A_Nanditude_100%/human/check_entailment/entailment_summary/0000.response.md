Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. The task is to determine the minimum number of new problems (with difficulty `w`) to propose so that the difficulty of each problem `a_i` does not exceed the expected difficulty `b_i`. The program provided instead counts the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the corresponding elements in `b`. This count does not reflect the number of new problems needed to ensure that all `a_i` are less than or equal to `b_i`.

The correct approach involves iteratively adding the smallest possible problems (with difficulty `w`) to the list `a` and removing the highest difficulty problem if `a_i` exceeds `b_i` after sorting. This process should continue until all `a_i` are less than or equal to `b_i`.

Since the provided program does not follow the correct logic, it will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
