test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of integers a of length n. Specifically, 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in the list a. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
