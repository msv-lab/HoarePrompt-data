Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of operations required for the corresponding test case to ensure that the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.**
