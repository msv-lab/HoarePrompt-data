You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A permutation is k-level if the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

### Analysis of the Program
The program reads multiple test cases, each with values of n and k. It then constructs a permutation of length n and prints it.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `array` is initialized as a list of integers from 1 to n.
   - `answer` is initialized with the first element as 1.
   - `a` is initialized as a list `[1, -1]` which seems to be used to alternate between two pointers.

2. **Generating the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates from 1 to n-1 (since the first element is already added).
   - For each iteration, it checks if `(-1)**i` is -1 (which happens for odd `i`):
     - If true, it appends the element at the index `a[-1]` (which starts at 1 and decrements) from `array` to `answer`.
     - If false, it appends the element at the index `a[0]` (which starts at 1 and increments) from `array` to `answer`.

3. **Output:**
   - The constructed permutation `answer` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check
The above logic does not guarantee that the generated permutation will be k-level. The logic seems to be alternating between picking elements from the start and end of the list `array`, but it does not ensure that the sums of any k-length segments will differ by no more than 1.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the program might generate a permutation like `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`. However, this permutation does not guarantee that all sums of 4-length segments will differ by no more than 1.

### Conclusion
The given program does not necessarily produce a k-level permutation as defined in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
