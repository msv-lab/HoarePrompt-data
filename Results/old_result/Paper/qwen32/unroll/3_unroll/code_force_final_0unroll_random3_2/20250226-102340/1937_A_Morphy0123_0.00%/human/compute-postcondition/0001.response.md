To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves `i` and `n_cases`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`n_cases`**: This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, `n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. **`i`**: This variable is the loop counter and is initialized to 0 before the loop starts. It does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is automatically initialized within the `range` function in Python.

Given the above points, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n_cases` is at least 1. The value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is controlled by the `range` function.

Here is the adjusted state:
State: **`n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 (automatically initialized in the loop)**

However, since `i` is automatically initialized within the loop, we only need to specify the condition for `n_cases`:
State: **`n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1**
