To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze what the loop does:

1. **Initialization**: The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **For each test case**:
   - It retrieves `n` (the length of the list) and `arr` (the list of integers).
   - It sorts the array `arr`.
   - It calculates the median index and the median value.
   - It creates a heap with the elements from the median index to the end of the array.
   - It initializes a counter `operations` to zero.
   - It enters a while loop that continues as long as the smallest element in the heap (which is the root of the heap) is less than or equal to the current median.
   - Inside the loop, it pops the smallest element, increments it by 1, pushes it back into the heap, and increments the `operations` counter.
   - Once the loop exits, it appends the `operations` count to the `results` list.

The `results` list will contain the number of operations required for each test case to ensure that the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and appends the result to the `results` list, the final state of the `results` list will be a list of integers, each representing the number of operations for the corresponding test case.

Output State: **results is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of operations required for the corresponding test case to ensure that the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.**
