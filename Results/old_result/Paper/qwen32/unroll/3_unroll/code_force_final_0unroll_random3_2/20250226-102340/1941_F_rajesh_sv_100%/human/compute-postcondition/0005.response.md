The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the loop starts with `i = 1` and runs until `i < n`.

Given that `n` is already specified to be a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the loop will definitely execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` or `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5; `A` is a list of `n` integers returned by `func_4()`; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models; `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`; `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None, `i` is 1**
