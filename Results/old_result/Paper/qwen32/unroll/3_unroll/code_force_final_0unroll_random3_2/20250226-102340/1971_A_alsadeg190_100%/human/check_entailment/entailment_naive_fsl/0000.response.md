Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers, `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum of the two integers followed by the maximum of the two integers, which aligns with the problem description. 

The logic in the code is straightforward and handles the given constraints:
- It correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of two numbers using a simple comparison.
- It processes each of the `t` test cases as specified.

There are no edge cases that the program does not handle, such as when `x` and `y` are equal, or when `x` and `y` are at their minimum or maximum values (0 and 9 respectively). The program works correctly for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
