Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not affected by the loop and will remain the same).
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
   - `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop runs `n` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
   - In each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
     - `k.bit_length()` gives the number of bits necessary to represent `k` in binary.
     - `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1)` shifts the number 1 left by `k.bit_length() - 1` places, effectively creating a binary number with a 1 followed by `k.bit_length() - 1` zeros.
     - Subtracting 1 from this number results in a binary number with `k.bit_length() - 1` ones, which is the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits.
   - After setting `nums[i]`, `k` is decremented by `nums[i]`.

3. **Effect on `k`:**
   - In each iteration, `k` is reduced by a value that is the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits.
   - This means that `k` will be reduced by a value close to, but less than, `k` itself in each iteration, until `k` becomes less than the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits.

4. **Final State:**
   - After `n` iterations, `nums` will be a list of `n` elements, each element being the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits at the time of its assignment.
   - `k` will be reduced by the sum of these values, and it will eventually become less than the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, but the exact value of `k` will depend on the initial value of `k` and the number of iterations `n`.

Given the loop's behavior, the final state of `nums` will be a list of `n` elements, each being the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits at the time of its assignment, and `k` will be reduced accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 (reduced by the sum of the largest numbers representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits for each iteration), and `nums` is a list of `n` elements, each being the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits at the time of its assignment.**
