Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategy that each player might use to maximize their score. Instead, it makes a naive assumption that players will only move to the position indicated by the permutation or stay in the same position, without considering other potential optimal moves.

Here are some issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the score for each player. It multiplies the current position's score by the remaining turns and compares it to the total score. This does not correctly simulate the game where scores accumulate over turns.
   
2. **Lack of Optimal Strategy**:
   - The code does not simulate the optimal strategy for each player. Players can choose to stay or move to the position indicated by the permutation, and the code does not correctly handle this decision-making process.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic is flawed. The code decrements `k` and updates the positions and scores, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the player might choose to stay in the same position.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
3 2 1 2
2 3 1
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
Sasha
```

Explanation:
- Initial positions: Bodya at position 1 (score 1), Sasha at position 2 (score 2).
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya stays at position 1 (score 1 + 1 = 2).
  - Sasha moves to position 3 (score 2 + 3 = 5).
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya stays at position 1 (score 2 + 1 = 3).
  - Sasha stays at position 3 (score 5 + 3 = 8).
- Final scores: Bodya (3), Sasha (8). Sasha wins.

However, the provided code will not correctly simulate this scenario and might give an incorrect result.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as simulating the game for each player and considering all possible moves to maximize their scores.
