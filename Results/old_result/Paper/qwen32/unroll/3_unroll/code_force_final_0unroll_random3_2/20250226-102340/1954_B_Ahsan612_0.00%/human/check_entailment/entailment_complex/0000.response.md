Reasoning: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the array, which is a step towards determining the minimum number of elements to remove for the array to stop being beautiful. However, this approach is not entirely correct for the given problem. 

The program correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the array. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array stops being beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its neighbors if they are the same. 

The minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer does not directly translate to the minimum number of elements to remove for the array to stop being beautiful. For example, in the case where the array is entirely composed of the same number, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences will be the length of the array, and the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements because all elements are already the same.

The program should instead check for the longest sequence of the same number that can be reduced to a single number by the allowed operation. If the entire array is composed of the same number, it should return -1 as no elements can be removed to make it non-beautiful. Otherwise, it should calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break the sequence that allows the array to be beautiful.

Given the current implementation, it fails to correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove in all cases. For example, in the case of `[3 3 3 5 3 3 3]`, the program will return 3, which is correct, but it does so by coincidence and not by following the intended logic for solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**
