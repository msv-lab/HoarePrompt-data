You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences:

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other, or with two others.

The constraints are:
- Each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.
- We need to respect the wishes of each participant.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the logic in the provided program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read first.
   - For each test case, the number of introverts `a`, extroverts `b`, and universals `c` are read.

2. **Logic for Determining the Number of Tents**:
   - **Case where it's impossible to accommodate**:
     - The condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` checks if the number of extroverts that cannot form a complete group of 3 can be paired with universals to form a tent. If not, it outputs `-1`.
   - **Calculating the number of tents**:
     - `k += a`: Each introvert needs a tent alone, so we add `a` to the total number of tents.
     - `k += (b + c) // 3`: This part attempts to form as many complete groups of 3 as possible with extroverts and universals.
     - `if (b + c) % 3 != 0`: If there are any remaining participants after forming complete groups of 3, an additional tent is needed. This is because any remaining extroverts must be paired with universals or other universals to form a tent.

### Evaluation

Let's check the logic against the problem requirements:

1. **Handling Extroverts**:
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, it means there are extroverts left over after forming groups of 3. These extroverts need to be paired with universals.
   - The condition `b % 3 + c < 3` checks if there are enough universals to pair with the leftover extroverts. If not, it correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Counting Tents**:
   - `k += a` correctly accounts for the introverts.
   - `k += (b + c) // 3` correctly counts the number of complete groups of 3 that can be formed.
   - `if (b + c) % 3 != 0` correctly adds an additional tent if there are leftover participants after forming complete groups of 3.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the minimum number of tents or determine if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the minimum number of tents required or determines if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
