Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**:
   - The program attempts to map each character in the encoded string to a character that has not yet been used in the mapping. However, this approach does not respect the symmetric property required by the problem. Specifically, the program does not construct the auxiliary string `r` and use it to find the symmetric character for each character in the encoded string.
   
2. **Lack of Symmetric Property**:
   - The problem requires that each character in the encoded string `b` be replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` (the first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). The provided program does not implement this symmetric replacement.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Distinct Characters**:
   - The program does not ensure that the characters in the auxiliary string `r` are distinct and sorted in alphabetical order. This is a crucial step in the decoding process as described in the problem.

To correct the program, we need to:
- Construct the auxiliary string `r` by taking all distinct characters from the encoded string and sorting them in alphabetical order.
- Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
- Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

def decode(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Create the auxiliary string r
    r = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Step 2: Create the mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = decode(encoded)
        print(decoded)
```

This corrected program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.
