In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `itm`, which iterates over the elements of the list `mex`. The state of `mex` determines whether the loop can execute. 

To ensure that the loop executes, `mex` must contain at least one element. The values of `minn` and `maxx` are not directly related to the execution of the loop itself, but rather to the logic inside the loop body, which is omitted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `mex` to ensure it contains at least one element. The values of `minn` and `maxx` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`mex` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `minn` is the final value of `minn` after the loop, and `maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered for non-positive `arr[i]` values.**
