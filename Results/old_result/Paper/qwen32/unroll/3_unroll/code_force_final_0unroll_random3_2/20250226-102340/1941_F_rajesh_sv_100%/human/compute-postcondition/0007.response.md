The code snippet assigns the values of the elements at positions `index - 1` and `index` in the list `A` to the variables `left` and `right`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in list `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in list `A`, `index` is the index of the element that is part of the pair with the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F` remain unchanged.**
