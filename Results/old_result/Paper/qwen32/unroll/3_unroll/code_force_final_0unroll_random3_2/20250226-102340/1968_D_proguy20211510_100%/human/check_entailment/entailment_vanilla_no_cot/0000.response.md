Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in its approach to calculating the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program assumes that the optimal strategy is to stay in the current position for as long as possible and then move to the next position in the permutation. However, this is not necessarily the case. The optimal strategy involves considering the entire cycle of the permutation and calculating the maximum score that can be achieved by choosing the best points to stay and move.

Here are some key issues with the provided code:

1. **Cycle Detection and Scoring Calculation**:
   - The program correctly detects cycles for both Bodya and Sasha but then incorrectly calculates the maximum score by assuming a linear strategy instead of considering the cycle's periodic nature.
   - The program does not correctly handle the periodicity of the permutation cycles, which is crucial for determining the optimal score.

2. **Handling Large k**:
   - The program does not efficiently handle large values of k (up to \(10^9\)). It should leverage the cycle length to reduce the number of iterations needed to calculate the score.

3. **Scoring Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the score by iterating through the path and summing the values. However, it does not consider the possibility of staying in a cycle that produces a higher score than moving to a new cycle.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Detect the cycle for each player.
- Calculate the sum of values in the cycle.
- Determine the number of complete cycles that can be traversed within k turns.
- Calculate the remaining turns after completing full cycles and add the corresponding values.
- Compare the scores for Bodya and Sasha and determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start):
            path = []
            vis = [0] * n
            pos = start - 1
            while not vis[pos]:
                vis[pos] = 1
                path.append(a[pos])
                pos = p[pos] - 1
            
            cycle_length = len(path)
            cycle_sum = sum(path)
            
            full_cycles = k // cycle_length
            remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
            
            score = full_cycles * cycle_sum
            for i in range(remaining_turns):
                score += path[i]
            
            return score
        
        score_b = calculate_score(pb)
        score_s = calculate_score(ps)
        
        if score_b > score_s:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_s > score_b:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the cycle detection and scoring calculation, ensuring the correct winner is determined for each test case.
