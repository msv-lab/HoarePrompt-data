You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that `p_i` is equal to `i`. If such an index exists, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least two friends come to the party. Here are a few issues and counterexamples:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Invitation Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then it can print `2` and break the loop. This condition does not correctly identify pairs of friends who can attend the party.
   - The program does not handle cases where the best friends are not in a simple cycle of two but in larger cycles or chains.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Larger Cycles:**
   - The program does not account for larger cycles of best friends. For example, if the list of best friends is `[2, 3, 1]`, the program will not correctly identify that inviting any one of these three friends will result in all three attending the party.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Chains:**
   - The program does not handle chains of best friends correctly. For example, if the list of best friends is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program will not correctly identify that inviting any three friends will result in at least two attending the party.

4. **Incorrect Output for Smaller Cases:**
   - For the test case where `n = 2` and `p = [2, 1]`, the program will output `2`, which is correct. However, for more complex cases, it will not output the correct minimum number of invitations.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3
```
The program outputs `3` for this test case, which is correct, but it does so by chance and not by correctly identifying the pairs or cycles. 

However, consider this test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 1 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3
```
The program incorrectly outputs `3` for this test case, as inviting friends `1` and `3` (or `2` and `4`) would result in two friends attending the party.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
