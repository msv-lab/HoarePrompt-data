Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when `n == 1`. According to the problem description, if there is no suitable string, the program should print "NO". However, the code incorrectly prints "YES" and an empty string for `n == 1`. Additionally, the code does not generate a string with exactly `n` special characters for all valid `n` values; it only handles the case when `n` is greater than 1. For `n == 1`, the correct response should be "NO" because it is impossible to have a single character that is special (as it would require a neighbor).

Let's consider the following test case:
```
Input:
2
1
2

Expected Output:
NO
YES
MM

Actual Output:
NO
YES

```
The actual output is missing the second line for the second test case, which should be "MM". This indicates that the code is not fully correct for all potential cases.
