`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case are not affected by this input. The output state is that `t` is now an integer input by the user, and it is still true that for each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.**
