Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x \leq 99\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 99\).
- Either `x` is 0, or `y` is 0, or both are 0.
- It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
- It is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(0)` statement explicitly prints the integer `0`. The value to be printed is not dependent on the variables `x` and `y` in any way. The conditions provided about `x` and `y` do not affect the execution of this print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
