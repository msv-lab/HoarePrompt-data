Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer; `cnt` is a defaultdict of type int initialized with default values of 0.**

In natural language: The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 20,000 inclusive. The variable `N` retains its value as an input integer. The list `a` keeps its values as a list of integers derived from splitting an input string. A new variable `cnt` is introduced as a `defaultdict` with integer values, initialized such that all keys default to 0.
