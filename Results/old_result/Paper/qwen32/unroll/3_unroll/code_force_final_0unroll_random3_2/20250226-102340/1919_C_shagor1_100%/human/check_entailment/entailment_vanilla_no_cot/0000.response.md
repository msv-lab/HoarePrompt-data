Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the sum of penalties `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The logic of the program is to maintain two variables `la` and `lb` which track the last added elements in the two subsequences `s` and `t`, and it increments the penalty count whenever it finds an element that cannot be added to either subsequence without breaking the increasing order, thus necessitating a "switch" to the other subsequence. This approach ensures that the penalty is minimized by always trying to add the current element to the subsequence that allows it to maintain its increasing order.
