### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to a given sum `n`, where each letter's position in the alphabet (from 1 to 26) is summed up.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code attempts to construct the word by filling the first two positions with either 1 or 26 based on the value of `lex`, and then assigns the remaining value to the third position. This approach does not guarantee the smallest possible word in many cases.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code with annotations:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   cases = int(input())
   for i in range(cases):
       arr = []
       lex = int(input())
   ```
   - The number of test cases is read, and for each test case, an integer `lex` (the encoded sum) is read.

2. **First Two Letters**:
   ```python
   for j in range(2):
       if lex <= 26:
           arr.append(1)
           lex = lex - 1
       elif lex < 52:
           arr.append(26)
           lex = lex - 26
       else:
           arr.append(26)
           lex = lex - 26
   ```
   - The first two letters are determined based on the value of `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it assigns 1 to the first position and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it assigns 26 to the first position and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is 52 or more, it assigns 26 to the first position and subtracts 26 from `lex`.

3. **Third Letter**:
   ```python
   arr.append(lex)
   ```
   - The remaining value of `lex` is assigned to the third position.

4. **Sorting and Output**:
   ```python
   arr.sort()
   for k in range(3):
       print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```
   - The values in `arr` are sorted and converted to characters, which are then printed.

#### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Construction**:
   - The code does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 52, the code might output "azy" instead of "aay".
   - The approach of assigning 26 to the first two positions and then the remaining value to the third position does not guarantee the smallest word.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the sum is at the boundary (e.g., 78) correctly. For example, it might output "zzz" but not in the most optimal way.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach involves starting with the smallest possible values for the first two letters and then calculating the third letter, ensuring that the word is lexicographically minimal.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible word "aaa"
        a, b, c = 1, 1, n - 2
        # Adjust b and c to ensure they are within the range [1, 26]
        if c > 26:
            b += c - 26
            c = 26
        if b > 26:
            a += b - 26
            b = 26
        # Print the result
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

# Example usage
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle all possible cases for the given problem description. It fails to ensure the lexicographically smallest word in many scenarios.

### Final: **False**
