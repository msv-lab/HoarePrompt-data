### Reasoning:
Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

#### Function Summary:
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters (each being either '0' or '1') with at least one '1'. It then calculates and prints the number of '0's between the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string.

#### Issues Identified in the Provided Code:
1. **Input Parsing**: The input array `arr` is read as a string. This is not incorrect per se, but it should be noted that the subsequent operations are based on string indices.
2. **Finding the Range**: The variable `x` finds the index of the first '1'. The variable `y` finds the index of the first '1' from the reversed string, which corresponds to the last '1' in the original string.
3. **Counting Operations**: The substring `z = arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. The correct substring should be `arr[x:n - y]` if `y` were correctly calculated as the last position. However, `n - y` is not the correct index for the last '1'. Instead, it should be `n - 1 - y` to get the correct index.
4. **Logic Flaw**: Even if the substring were correctly identified, counting the '0's between the first and last '1' does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a contiguous block. This involves finding a median position and summing the distances each chip needs to move to this median position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if arr[i] == 1]
        median_position = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
        operations = sum(abs(pos - median_position) for pos in chip_positions)
        print(operations)

# Example usage
# func()
```

#### Explanation of the Correct Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: The input array `arr` is parsed as a list of integers.
2. **Chip Positions**: We collect the positions of all chips in the `chip_positions` list.
3. **Median Position**: The median position is chosen as the target position for the block of chips. This minimizes the total number of moves.
4. **Counting Operations**: The number of operations is calculated as the sum of the distances from each chip to the median position.

Given the issues in the provided code and the need for a more accurate approach, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
