You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an array of integers by first incrementing each element by its 1-based index, then constructs a new list by inserting additional elements between the sorted unique values of the modified array. The inserted elements are one less than the previous element in the new list, and the total number of inserted elements ensures the final list's length equals the original array's length. The function prints the resulting list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program seems to be attempting to handle duplicates and gaps in the values of `a_i + i` in a way that does not guarantee the lexicographically largest `b`.

Here is a detailed analysis of why the program might be incorrect:

1. **Handling Duplicates and Gaps**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each value in the modified array `a` (where `a[i]` is replaced by `a[i] + i + 1`).
   - It then sorts the unique values in descending order and tries to fill in gaps between these values with the appropriate number of duplicates.
   - However, the logic for filling in these gaps is flawed. The program might not be placing the duplicates in the correct positions to ensure the lexicographically largest `b`.

2. **Example of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     3
     6 4 8
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     11 7 6
     ```
   - The program might produce an incorrect output because it does not correctly handle the placement of duplicates and gaps. For example, it might produce:
     ```
     11 8 7 6
     ```
   - This output is not lexicographically larger than the expected output.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To ensure the lexicographically largest `b`, we should always try to maximize the values in `b` at each step.
   - This can be achieved by always selecting the largest possible value of `a_i + i` in each operation and ensuring that duplicates are handled correctly.
   - A correct approach might involve using a max-heap to always extract the largest value and then managing duplicates in a way that maintains the lexicographically largest order.

Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee the lexicographically largest `b` for all possible inputs, and thus it is incorrect.
