The code snippet assigns the value of the element at `index - 1` in the list `A` to the variable `left`, and the value of the element at `index` in the list `A` to the variable `right`. No other variables are directly modified by this code.

Given the initial state, the only changes are the introduction of the variables `left` and `right` with their respective values from the list `A`.

Output State: **`A` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `n` is the length of the list returned by `func_4()`, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that is part of the pair with the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`.**
