### Reasoning:

The given problem involves a game between Alice and Bob where Alice tries to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`, while Bob tries to minimize it. Both players play optimally.

The strategy for Alice and Bob can be summarized as follows:
- Alice should try to include as many elements as possible from `a` into `c` such that the MEX is maximized.
- Bob should try to exclude elements from `a` such that the MEX is minimized.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The program's logic is to count the occurrences of each number in `a` and then determine the MEX based on these counts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: The program initializes a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
2. **Handling Zeros**: If there are no zeros in `a` (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `a`.
3. **Determining MEX**: If there are zeros, the program determines the MEX by iterating through the counts. The variable `c` is initialized to the minimum of `2` and the count of zeros. This is because Alice can place at most two zeros in `c` to maximize the MEX. The program then iterates through the counts of integers from `1` to `n`. If the count of any integer is less than `2`, it decrements `c`. If `c` becomes `0` or the loop reaches the end, the current integer `j` is the MEX.

The program correctly handles the following scenarios:
- If there are no zeros, the MEX is `0`.
- If there are zeros, the program considers the counts of other integers to determine the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. **First Example**: `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Counts: `cntl = [2, 2, 0, 0]`
   - Since `cntl[0] != 0`, `c = min(2, 2) = 2`
   - Iteration:
     - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 2` (no change in `c`)
     - `j = 2`: `cntl[2] = 0` (`c -= 1` → `c = 1`)
     - `j = 3`: `cntl[3] = 0` (`c -= 1` → `c = 0`)
   - The MEX is `2`.

2. **Second Example**: `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Counts: `cntl = [1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Since `cntl[0] != 0`, `c = min(2, 1) = 1`
   - Iteration:
     - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 1` (`c -= 1` → `c = 0`)
   - The MEX is `1`.

3. **Third Example**: `a = [1, 1]`
   - Counts: `cntl = [0, 2]`
   - Since `cntl[0] == 0`, the MEX is `0`.

The program produces the correct output for the given examples, indicating that the logic is correct.
