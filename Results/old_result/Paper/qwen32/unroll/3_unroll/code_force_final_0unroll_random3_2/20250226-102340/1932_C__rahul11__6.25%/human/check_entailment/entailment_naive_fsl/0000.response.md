Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a critical error in the way it handles the product of the array elements and the modulo operation. Specifically, the line `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD` are incorrect because integer division (`//`) does not work as intended in this context, especially when the product is not perfectly divisible by the element being removed. Instead, the program should use modular multiplicative inverses to handle division under modulo.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
2 3 4
LRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4 3 1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initial product: \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(24 \mod 5 = 4\).
- After 'L': Array becomes \([3, 4]\). Product is \(3 \cdot 4 = 12\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(12 \mod 5 = 2\). However, the program incorrectly calculates this as \(24 // 2 \mod 5 = 12 \mod 5 = 2\), which is correct in this case but can fail in others.
- After 'R': Array becomes \([3]\). Product is \(3\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(3 \mod 5 = 3\).
- After 'L': Array becomes \([]\). Product is \(1\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(1 \mod 5 = 1\).

However, consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
2 5 4
LRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 0 1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initial product: \(2 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 = 40\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(40 \mod 5 = 0\).
- After 'L': Array becomes \([5, 4]\). Product is \(5 \cdot 4 = 20\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(20 \mod 5 = 0\).
- After 'R': Array becomes \([5]\). Product is \(5\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(5 \mod 5 = 0\).
- After 'L': Array becomes \([]\). Product is \(1\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(1 \mod 5 = 1\).

The program will incorrectly handle the division step, especially when the product is not perfectly divisible by the element being removed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should use modular multiplicative inverses to handle division under modulo. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mod_inverse(a, m):
    m0, x0, x1 = m, 0, 1
    if m == 1:
        return 0
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        m, a = a % m, m
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    if x1 < 0:
        x1 += m0
    return x1

def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[l], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[r], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# func()
```

This corrected version uses the modular multiplicative inverse to correctly handle the division step under modulo.
