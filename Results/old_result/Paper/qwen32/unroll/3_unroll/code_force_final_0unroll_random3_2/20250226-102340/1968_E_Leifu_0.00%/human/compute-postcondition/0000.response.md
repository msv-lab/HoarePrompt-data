Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the integer input by the user, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 50 inclusive. The variable `n` and its constraints remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
