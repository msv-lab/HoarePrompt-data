Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines of results, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, the output is either 'NO' if it's not possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that one part is a prefix and the other is a suffix of the original string and they are different, or 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting split string(s) if such a split is possible. The state of the input variable `t` and the strings `s` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected beyond their use within the loop iterations.**
