To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the variables `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, and `results` are modified within the loop.

The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration:
1. `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
2. `idx` is incremented by 1.
3. `a` is updated to a list of `n` integers starting from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]`.
4. `idx` is incremented by `n`.
5. The result of `func_1(n, a)` is appended to the `results` list.

After the loop completes, `idx` will be incremented by `1 + n` for each iteration, and `results` will contain the output of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.

The other variables like `data` and `t` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `data` is a list of substrings.
- `idx` is 1.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `results` is an empty list.

After the loop:
- `idx` will be `1 + sum(n for each iteration) + t`.
- `results` will contain the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.
- `n` and `a` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
- `t` and `data` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the number of cards from the last iteration, `a` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` is the same list of substrings, `idx` is incremented by `1 + sum(n for each iteration) + t`, `t` is unchanged, `results` is a list of results from `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.**
