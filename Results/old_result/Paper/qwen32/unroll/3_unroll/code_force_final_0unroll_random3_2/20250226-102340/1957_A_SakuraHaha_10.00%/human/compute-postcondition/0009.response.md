Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` indicating the number of sticks available, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. The function returns a value for each test case indicating whether it is possible to form a triangle with any three of the given sticks.**
