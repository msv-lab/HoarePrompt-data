Let's analyze the given Python program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
Monocarp wants to invite his friends to a party such that at least two of them come. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and both `i` and `p_i` must receive invitations for `i` to attend the party. The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least two friends attend.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of a main loop that processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1`. In `func_1`:
1. It reads the number of friends `n`.
2. It reads the list `p` of best friends.
3. If `n` is `2`, it directly prints `2` because both friends must be invited.
4. Otherwise, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such an index exists, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify if this logic correctly determines the minimum number of invitations required:

- **Case 1: `n = 2`**
  - It is straightforward to see that both friends must be invited because they are each other's best friends. The program correctly prints `2`.
  
- **Case 2: `n > 2`**
  - The program checks for the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition checks for a cycle of length 3 (i.e., `i -> p_i -> p_{p_i} -> i`).
  - If such a cycle exists, then by inviting any one of the three friends in the cycle, two friends will attend the party. The program correctly prints `2` in this case.
  - If no such cycle exists, the program assumes that Monocarp needs to send at least `3` invitations to ensure that at least two friends attend. This is because the smallest configuration that doesn't form a cycle of length 3 would be a configuration where friends form a chain or multiple disjoint cycles of length greater than 3. In such cases, inviting two friends might not guarantee two attendees, so the program correctly prints `3`.

### Conclusion
The logic in the program aligns with the problem requirements and correctly handles the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The program correctly handles the case where `n = 2` and checks for cycles of length 3 for `n > 2`. It ensures that at least two friends attend the party with the minimum number of invitations.
Correctness: **True**
