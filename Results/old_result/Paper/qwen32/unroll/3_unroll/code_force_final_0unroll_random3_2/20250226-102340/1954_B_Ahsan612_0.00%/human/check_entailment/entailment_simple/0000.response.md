### Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The algorithm works by identifying the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the array. This is based on the observation that removing all but one element from the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements will make the array non-beautiful.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, read the length of the array, `n`, and the array itself, `ar`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Consecutive Sequence**:
   - Initialize `same` to 1, which will count the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - Initialize `num` to the first element of the array.
   - Initialize `minn` to infinity, which will store the length of the shortest sequence of identical elements found.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Loop through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as the previous one (`ar[i] == num`), increment `same`.
   - If the current element is different (`ar[i] != num`):
     - Update `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Reset `same` to 1 and update `num` to the current element.
     - Move to the next element.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, update `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there was no sequence found, which is not possible given the problem constraints. However, if `minn` is 1, it means the array is already non-beautiful, and the output should be -1.
   - Otherwise, print `minn` as the result.

### Analysis:

- The algorithm correctly identifies the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
- If the shortest sequence length is 1, the array is already non-beautiful, and the output should be -1.
- If the shortest sequence length is greater than 1, removing all but one element from this sequence will make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. The logic is sound, and the implementation matches the problem requirements.
