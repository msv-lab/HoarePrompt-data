To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable that directly affects the execution of the loop is the value obtained from `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variables `n` and `a` are related to the individual test cases and do not directly affect whether the loop starts executing.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1. The other variables `n` and `a` are relevant within the loop body and do not need adjustment for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
