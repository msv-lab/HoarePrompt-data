The only object in the loop head is the variable `char` and the iterable `encoded`. For the loop to execute, the iterable `encoded` must contain at least one character. The variables `mapping` and `decoded` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `encoded` must be a non-empty string.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list**
