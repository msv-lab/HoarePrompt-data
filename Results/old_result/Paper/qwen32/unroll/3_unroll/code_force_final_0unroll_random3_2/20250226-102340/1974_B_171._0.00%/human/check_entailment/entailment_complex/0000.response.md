Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string based on the described algorithm. The function `func_1` attempts to map each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z', but it does not follow the symmetric character replacement rule as described in the problem statement.

To correctly decode the string, we need to:
1. Determine the set of unique characters in the encoded string and sort them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character (first to last, second to second last, etc.).
3. Replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the symmetric mapping.

The provided function `func_1` does not perform these steps correctly. Instead, it tries to map each character in the encoded string to a new character from 'a' to 'z' without considering the symmetric property required by the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    # Step 1: Determine the set of unique characters and sort them to form `r`
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    
    # Step 2: Create the symmetric mapping
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Step 3: Replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
