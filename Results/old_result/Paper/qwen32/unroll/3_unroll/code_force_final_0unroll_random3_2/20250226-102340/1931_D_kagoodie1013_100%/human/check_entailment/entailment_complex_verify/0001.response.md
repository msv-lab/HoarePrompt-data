### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the key steps and logic of the provided solution to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to determine the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` of length `n`. A pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if:
- `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`
- `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`

#### Solution Analysis:
The solution involves reading the input, processing each test case, and counting the number of beautiful pairs in each array.

#### Key Steps in the Solution:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The entire input is read at once and split into a list of strings.
   - The number of test cases `t` is extracted.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted, followed by the array `arr` of length `n`.
   - This information is stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, a `residue_map` dictionary is initialized to keep track of pairs of residues.
   - The solution iterates through each number in the array `arr`.
   - For each number `num` in the array, it calculates:
     - `r_x = -num % x`
     - `r_y = num % y`
   - The count of beautiful pairs is incremented by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before (using `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`).
   - The current residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` is added to the `residue_map` and its count is incremented.

3. **Calculating Residues:**
   - The key part of the solution is the calculation of residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x` ensures that the residue is non-negative.
     - `r_y = num % y` is straightforward.
   - The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful can be rephrased in terms of residues:
     - `a[i] + a[j] ≡ 0 (mod x)` ⟹ `a[i] ≡ -a[j] (mod x)` ⟹ `a[i] % x ≡ -a[j] % x (mod x)`
     - `a[i] - a[j] ≡ 0 (mod y)` ⟹ `a[i] ≡ a[j] (mod y)` ⟹ `a[i] % y ≡ a[j] % y (mod y)`
   - Therefore, a pair `(i, j)` is beautiful if `(a[i] % x, a[i] % y)` has been seen before as `(-a[j] % x, a[j] % y)`.

#### Correctness:
The solution correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs by using a dictionary to keep track of the residues seen so far. The logic for calculating residues and checking for beautiful pairs is sound. The solution efficiently processes each test case in a single pass through the array, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after key operations. Specifically, the annotations confirm that the `residue_map` is used to count the occurrences of residue pairs, which is consistent with the logic for identifying beautiful pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct based on the problem description and the constraints. The annotations support the correctness of the solution by accurately describing the program's behavior and state at key points.

**Final: True**
