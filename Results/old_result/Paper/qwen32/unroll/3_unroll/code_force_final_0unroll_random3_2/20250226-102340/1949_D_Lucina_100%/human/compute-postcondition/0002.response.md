The code snippet creates a new list `b` with `n + 1` zeros. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `a` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, and `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
