Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or whose corresponding pair divisor (i.e., `x // i`) is less than or equal to `n`.**
