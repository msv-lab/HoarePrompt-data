### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions to ensure they meet the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Input:** Reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
   - **Logic:**
     - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]`.
     - It iterates over each character `s` in `a`. For each character, it updates the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far by appending a new list `[x, y]` to `S`.
     - It then iterates over each possible position `i` where the road could be placed.
     - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's (`left`) and '1's (`right`) on the left and right sides of the road, respectively.
     - It checks if the counts of '0's and '1's on both sides satisfy the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
     - If the condition is satisfied, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints the position `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Input:** Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Logic:**
     - It repeatedly calls `func_1` `t` times.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Initialization of `S`:** The list `S` is used to keep a running total of the number of '0's and '1's encountered up to each position in the string `a`. This allows us to efficiently calculate the number of '0's and '1's on both sides of any possible road position.
  
- **Condition Check:** The condition `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. This is equivalent to checking if `left >= ceil(lsum / 2)` and `right >= ceil(rsum / 2)`.

- **Finding the Closest Position:** The function keeps track of the position `ans` that is closest to the middle of the village and satisfies the condition. If multiple positions are equally close to the middle, it retains the smaller one.

### Analysis of `func_2`:

- **Test Cases:** The function `func_2` ensures that `func_1` is called for each test case, handling multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. They efficiently determine the optimal position for the road by leveraging prefix sums and ensuring that the conditions on the number of satisfied residents are met. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness:** **True**
