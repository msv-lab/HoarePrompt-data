Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 representing the current index or step in the process of constructing stairs in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the segment of the array `arr` that is being processed, and `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that not all elements in the segment `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` match their respective indices. Additionally, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.**
