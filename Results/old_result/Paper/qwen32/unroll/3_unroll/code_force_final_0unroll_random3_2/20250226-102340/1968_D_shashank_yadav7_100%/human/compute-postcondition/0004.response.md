Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a series of positions and values. For each test case, it determines whether 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' has a higher score based on the given rules, or if it's a 'Draw'. The score is calculated by traversing a list of positions and accumulating values, with a limit on the number of steps (`k`). The function outputs 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case.**
