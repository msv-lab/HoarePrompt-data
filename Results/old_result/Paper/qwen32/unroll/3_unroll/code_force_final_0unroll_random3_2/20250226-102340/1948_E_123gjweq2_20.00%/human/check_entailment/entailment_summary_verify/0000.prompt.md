You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` modifies a portion of the array `arr` between the indices `left` and `right` by setting the first half to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. It also sets the corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array to the given `clique` number.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description correctly. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them within the functions. This can lead to undefined behavior if the variables are not properly initialized in the global scope before calling these functions.

2. **Logic Errors in `make_array`**:
   - The logic for filling the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in `make_array` is flawed. The calculation of `mid` and `not_mid` does not ensure that the values assigned to `arr` are distinct integers from 1 to n.
   - The way elements are assigned to `arr` and `cliquess` does not guarantee that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to print the values assigned to the vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques. However, it does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
   - The function `make_array` does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when `k` is small relative to `n`.

4. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output something like:
     ```
     1 2 3 4 5
     1
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
     This output is incorrect because the graph with `n = 5` and `k = 4` can be partitioned into fewer than 1 clique. For example, a valid output could be:
     ```
     1 3 5 2 4
     2
     1 1 1 2 2
     ```
     Here, the vertices are partitioned into two cliques, and the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| ≤ k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

5. **Lack of Input Handling**:
   - The provided code does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only defines functions but does not read input or process multiple test cases.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and fails to meet the problem description for various potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
