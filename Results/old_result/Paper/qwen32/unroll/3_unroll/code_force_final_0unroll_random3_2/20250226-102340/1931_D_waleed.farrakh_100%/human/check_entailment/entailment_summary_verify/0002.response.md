Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to verify its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting pairs \((i, j)\) in an array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1`**: Processes each test case and counts the number of beautiful pairs.
2. **`func_2`**: Reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Detailed Reasoning:

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `freq` is a dictionary to store the frequency of pairs \((rx, ry)\).
   - `count` keeps track of the number of beautiful pairs found.

2. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures that `rx` is the non-negative remainder of \(-a\) modulo \(x\).
     - `ry = a % y`: This is the remainder of \(a\) modulo \(y\).
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it means there are previous elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element, and it increments `count` by the frequency of `(rx, ry)`.
   - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The calculation of `rx` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative.
   - The logic for counting pairs is based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**:
  - Reads input from standard input.
  - Parses the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

### Function Summary:
- The function `func_2` correctly reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Verification:
- The provided sample input-output pairs are correctly handled by the program.
- The logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound, as it correctly checks the conditions for each pair using the precomputed remainders.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
