Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `ans` is 0.**

Natural language: The variable `ans` has been assigned the value 0. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
