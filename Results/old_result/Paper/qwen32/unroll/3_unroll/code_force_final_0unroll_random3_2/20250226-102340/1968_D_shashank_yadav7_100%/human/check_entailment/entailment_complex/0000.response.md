### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the "Permutation game" problem as described. Let's analyze the logic and correctness of the program step by step:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to zero-based indexing by subtracting 1 from each.

2. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to `a[P_B]` and `a[P_S]`, respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) for Bodya and Sasha are initialized to `a[P_B] * k` and `a[P_S] * k`, respectively. However, this initialization seems incorrect because `bm` and `sm` should be initialized to the initial scores, not the product of the initial score and `k`.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program runs a loop for up to `k` turns, updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - In each iteration, the scores are updated by adding the value at the new position.
   - The maximum scores (`bm` and `sm`) are updated to be the maximum of their current values and the sum of the current score and the remaining possible scores (`a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively).

4. **Final Score Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Initialization of `bm` and `sm`:** The initial values of `bm` and `sm` should be `bp` and `sp`, not `bp * k` and `sp * k`. The way they are currently initialized, the program assumes that the maximum score is achieved by staying in the same position for all `k` turns, which is not necessarily true.
- **Updating `bm` and `sm`:** The logic for updating `bm` and `sm` is incorrect. Instead of multiplying the remaining turns by the current position's value, it should just add the current position's value to the current score. The maximum score should be updated based on the accumulated scores over the turns, not the potential maximum scores.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly compute the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game.

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, the initialization and updating of `bm` and `sm` should be corrected to reflect the actual accumulated scores over the turns.
