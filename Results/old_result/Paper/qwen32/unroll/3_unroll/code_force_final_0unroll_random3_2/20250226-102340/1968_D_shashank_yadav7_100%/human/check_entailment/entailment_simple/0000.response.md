### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the "Permutation Game" between Bodya and Sasha based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - The lists `p` (permutation) and `a` (array) are read.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - Since Python uses 0-based indexing, the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` are decremented by 1.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to `a[P_B]` and `a[P_S]`, respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are initially set to `a[P_B] * k` and `a[P_S] * k`, respectively.

4. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The game is simulated for `k` turns.
   - For each turn, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated based on the permutation `p`.
   - The scores are updated by adding the value of `a` at the new positions.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha are recalculated considering the best possible moves.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After `k` turns, the program compares the maximum possible scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater than `sm`, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater than `bm`, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly simulate the game logic for maximizing scores. The logic for updating `bm` and `sm` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the optimal strategy for both players.
- The program should simulate the game for `k` turns and keep track of the maximum possible scores for both players based on their optimal moves, but the current implementation does not achieve this correctly.

### Correctness:
Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the winner for each test case based on the optimal strategy of both players. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
