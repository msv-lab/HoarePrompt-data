To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, let's analyze the code and its effect on the variables.

The provided code is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes an array `ar` to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in each iteration of the outer loop:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1, representing the count of consecutive occurrences of the current number.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array `ar`.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`), representing the minimum count of consecutive occurrences encountered so far.

2. **Processing the Array**:
   - The while loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If `ar[i]` is different from `num`, the loop updates `num` to `ar[i]`, calculates the minimum between `minn` and `same`, and resets `same` to 1.
   - The index `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After the while loop, the code calculates the minimum between `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence of consecutive numbers.
   - If `minn` is still infinity (which would mean the array was empty, but the problem guarantees non-empty arrays), it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the array.

After all test cases are processed, the variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` will have values corresponding to the last test case processed. However, since the problem asks for the output state in terms of the final printed values for each test case, we need to focus on the output printed for each test case rather than the internal state of the variables.

Given the nature of the problem, the output state will consist of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences for each test case, printed line by line.

Output State: **The output state consists of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer for each test case, printed line by line.**
