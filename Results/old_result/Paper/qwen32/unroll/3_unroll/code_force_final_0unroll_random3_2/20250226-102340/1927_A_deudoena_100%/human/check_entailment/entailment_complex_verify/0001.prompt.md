You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that there is at least one 'B' in the string s.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s` (1-indexed), `m` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s` (1-indexed), `d` is 0, and `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: ma is the 0-indexed position of the last 'B' in s, mi is unchanged, m is unchanged, s is unchanged, c is unchanged, d is the distance from the end of the string to the last 'B', l is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 0-indexed position of the last 'B' in the string `s`, and `mi` is unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the length of the substring in `s` that starts from the first occurrence of 'B' and ends at the last occurrence of 'B', inclusive.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to ensure that all cells in a given strip become white. The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.

### Code Analysis:
The code reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. Let's break down what `func_1()` does:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0. These variables will store the maximum and minimum positions of black cells from the start and end of the strip, respectively.
   - `m` is the length of the strip.
   - `s` is the string representing the strip.
   - `c` and `d` are counters for iterating through the strip from the start and end, respectively.
   - `l` is an empty list, but it is not used anywhere in the function.

2. **Finding the First Black Cell from the Start**:
   - The code iterates through the string `s` from the start.
   - It increments `c` for each character.
   - When it finds the first 'B', it sets `mi` to `c` (the position of the first black cell from the start) and breaks the loop.

3. **Finding the First Black Cell from the End**:
   - The code iterates through the string `s` from the end.
   - It increments `d` for each character.
   - When it finds the first 'B', it sets `ma` to `len(s) - d` (the position of the first black cell from the end) and breaks the loop.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The function returns `ma - mi + 2`.

### Correctness Analysis:
The logic in the code is flawed. The goal is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to cover all black cells. However, the current implementation does not achieve this:

- The variables `ma` and `mi` are intended to capture the positions of the first and last black cells, but the calculation `ma - mi + 2` does not give the correct minimum segment length.
- For example, in the first test case ("WBBWBW"), the first black cell is at position 2 (`mi = 2`), and the last black cell is at position 5 (`ma = 5`). The correct minimum segment length is 4, but the function returns `5 - 2 + 2 = 5`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect as it does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.

Correctness: **False**
