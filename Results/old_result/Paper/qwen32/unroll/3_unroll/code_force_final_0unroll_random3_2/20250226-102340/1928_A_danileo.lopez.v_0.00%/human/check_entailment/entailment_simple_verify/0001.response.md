### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step using the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically.
   - If he cuts horizontally, he divides the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of sizes `(a, x)` and `(a, b-x)` where `0 < x < b`.
   - If he cuts vertically, he divides the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of sizes `(x, b)` and `(a-x, b)` where `0 < x < a`.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle:**
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - For the new rectangle to be different from the original one, the dimensions of the new rectangle should not be the same as the original rectangle, even after accounting for 90-degree rotations.

3. **Key Observation:**
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
     - For example, if `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of sizes `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a, b/2)`.
     - Similarly, if `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of sizes `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a/2, b)`.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts result in smaller rectangles of odd dimensions, and rearranging these will not form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
  - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes", indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
  - If the condition is false, it prints "No", indicating that another rectangle cannot be formed.

### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program checks the evenness of `a` or `b` and prints "Yes" or "No" based on the condition.
- The annotations also indicate that the variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function, and for each test case, the program correctly prints "Yes" if at least one of the integers `a` or `b` is even, otherwise it prints "No".

### Conclusion:
The program's logic aligns perfectly with the key observation made in the problem description. It correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle based on the evenness of the dimensions `a` and `b`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
