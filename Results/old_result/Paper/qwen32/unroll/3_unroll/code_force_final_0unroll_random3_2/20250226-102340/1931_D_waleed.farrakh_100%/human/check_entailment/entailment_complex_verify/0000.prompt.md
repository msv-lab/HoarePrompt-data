You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, for each element \(a_i\), it calculates the remainders:
- \(rx = (-a_i \% x + x) \% x\)
- \(ry = a_i \% y\)

The key idea is that for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, the remainders of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) when divided by \(x\) and \(y\) must satisfy certain conditions:
- \(rx_i + rx_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
- \(ry_i \equiv ry_j \pmod{y}\)

The program uses the frequency dictionary to count how many times each pair of remainders has been seen so far. If the current element's remainder pair \((rx, ry)\) has been seen before, it increments the count by the number of times that pair has been seen.

### Edge Cases and Correctness

Let's consider the following aspects:
1. **Correctness of Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation of \(rx\) ensures that it is always a non-negative remainder when \(a_i\) is negated and taken modulo \(x\).
   - The calculation of \(ry\) is straightforward and correct.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program correctly counts pairs by checking if the complement remainder pair \((rx, ry)\) has been seen before.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary to efficiently keep track of seen pairs.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
   - It collects results for each test case and prints them in the correct order.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program processes each element of the array in constant time, making it efficient even for large arrays.

### Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Example Input:**
```
7
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
7 9 5
1 10 15 3 8 12 15
9 4 10
14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6
9 5 6
10 7 6 7 9 7 7 10 10
9 6 2
4 9 7 1 2 2 13 3 15
9 2 3
14 6 1 15 12 15 8 2 15
10 5 7
13 3 3 2 12 11 3 7 13 14
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0
1
3
5
7
0
```

The program should correctly output the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. There are no obvious edge cases or issues that would cause the program to fail.

**Correctness:** **True**.

The program correctly handles the problem requirements and efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
