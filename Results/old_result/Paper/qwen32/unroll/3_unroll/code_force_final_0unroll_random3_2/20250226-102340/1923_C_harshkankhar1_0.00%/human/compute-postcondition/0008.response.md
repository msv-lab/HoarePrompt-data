Output State: **`t` remains the same integer; `n` and `q` remain the same integers; `c` remains the same list of integers; `a` is still a list of integers where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index in the original list; `b` is still a list where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[i] > 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.**
