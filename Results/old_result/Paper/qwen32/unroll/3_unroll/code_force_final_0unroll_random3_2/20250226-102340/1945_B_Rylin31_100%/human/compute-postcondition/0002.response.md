To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the code snippet and the initial state provided.

The given code snippet is a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is an input integer. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, and then it prints the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Let's break down what happens in each iteration:
1. The integers `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input.
2. The expression `m // a` calculates how many times the visibility duration `m` can fit into the frequency `a`.
3. The expression `m // b` calculates how many times the visibility duration `m` can fit into the frequency `b`.
4. The results of the two divisions are summed up, and 2 is added to the sum.
5. The result is then printed.

Since the loop runs `t` times, there will be `t` print statements, each corresponding to one set of input values `a`, `b`, and `m`.

The output state will simply be the sequence of outputs generated by each iteration of the loop, which are the results of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for each set of input values.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each line being the result of `m // a + m // b + 2` for the corresponding input values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
