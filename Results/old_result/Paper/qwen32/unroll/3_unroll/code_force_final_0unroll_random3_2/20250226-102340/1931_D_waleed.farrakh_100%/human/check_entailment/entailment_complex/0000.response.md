### Reasoning:
The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Purpose**: This function reads the input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and then calls `func_1` to process these test cases.
    - **Input Parsing**: It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
    - **State Before Call to `func_1`**: The `test_cases` list contains tuples of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, which is the expected format for `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Purpose**: This function processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
    - **Logic**:
        - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(rx, ry)`.
        - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates `rx` and `ry`, which are the remainders when `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
        - If the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before, it increments the count by the frequency of this pair.
        - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(rx, ry)` in the `freq` dictionary.
    - **State After Processing**: The `results` list contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the first test case from the example:

- **Input**: `n=6`, `x=5`, `y=2`, `arr=[1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
- **Expected Output**: `2`

**Step-by-step Execution**:
1. **Initialization**: `freq = {}`, `count = 0`
2. **Processing Elements**:
    - For `a=1`: `rx=1`, `ry=1`. `freq` is empty, so `count` remains `0`. Update `freq[(1, 1)]` to `1`.
    - For `a=2`: `rx=2`, `ry=0`. `freq` does not contain `(2, 0)`, so `count` remains `0`. Update `freq[(2, 0)]` to `1`.
    - For `a=7`: `rx=2`, `ry=2`. `freq` does not contain `(2, 2)`, so `count` remains `0`. Update `freq[(2, 2)]` to `1`.
    - For `a=4`: `rx=4`, `ry=0`. `freq` does not contain `(4, 0)`, so `count` remains `0`. Update `freq[(4, 0)]` to `1`.
    - For `a=9`: `rx=4`, `ry=1`. `freq` does not contain `(4, 1)`, so `count` remains `0`. Update `freq[(4, 1)]` to `1`.
    - For `a=6`: `rx=1`, `ry=0`. `freq` contains `(1, 0)`, so `count` is incremented by `1`. Update `freq[(1, 0)]` to `1`.

3. **Final Count**: `count = 2`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly processes the input and computes the number of beautiful pairs for each test case as described in the problem statement. The logic within `func_1` is sound and aligns with the requirements.

**Correctness: True**
