Reasoning:

The given problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, the idea is to arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

One optimal strategy for achieving this is to sort the array in ascending order. When the array is sorted, the beauty is maximized because the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference.

The difference between the maximum and minimum values (x - y) is not equivalent to the maximum beauty of the array. The maximum beauty is obtained by maximizing the sum of consecutive differences, which is achieved by sorting the array, not by simply taking the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

For example, consider the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. The optimal arrangement to maximize beauty would be [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], giving a beauty of (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 13. However, the provided program would output 100 - 43 = 57, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
