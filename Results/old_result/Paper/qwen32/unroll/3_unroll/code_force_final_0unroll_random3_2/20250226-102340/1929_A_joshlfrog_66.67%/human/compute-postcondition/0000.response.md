The given Python code snippet is `t = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, but after executing this line, `t` will be reassigned to the value provided by the user's input. The other variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
