### Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations, as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program's logic and see if it achieves the desired result.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates through the range from 1 to `n` and calculates the sum of the matrix elements.
   - The logic inside the loop seems incorrect. It tries to add the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`n * (n + 1) // 2`) to `sum` if it is greater than `i * n`. Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to `sum`. This does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix.

3. **Operation Generation:**
   - The program prints the calculated `sum` and the number of operations `n + r`.
   - It then generates `n + r` operations. The first `n` operations are of type 1, where it fills each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The next `r` operations are of type 2, where it fills each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Sum Calculation:** The logic for calculating the sum is incorrect. The sum of the matrix elements should be maximized by filling each row and column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n` is \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \). This is because each number from 1 to `n` will appear exactly `n` times in the matrix, contributing to the sum.
- **Incorrect Number of Operations:** The number of operations `n + r` is not necessarily the minimum or the correct number of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. The program should aim to use no more than \( 2n \) operations.

### Correct Approach:
- **Sum Calculation:** The maximum sum is \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \).
- **Operation Generation:** Use `n` operations of type 1 to fill each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This ensures that each element in the matrix is filled with a unique number from 1 to `n`, maximizing the sum.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the sum calculation and the logic for generating operations, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
