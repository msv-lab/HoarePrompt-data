The provided loop iterates over each element in the list `mex` and prints it followed by a space. It does not modify the elements of `mex` or any other variables (`minn`, `maxx`, etc.). Therefore, the values of `minn` and `maxx` remain unchanged after the loop execution.

Output State: **mex is the same list of integers, minn is the final value of minn after the loop, and maxx is the maximum value of abs(arr[i] - minn) encountered for non-positive arr[i] values.**
