Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. Next is an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The `input` function is now `sys.stdin.readline`. `N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input.**

In simpler terms: The initial conditions about the test cases, array, and queries remain the same. The variable `N` is now assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, which represents the length of the array `a` for the first test case.
