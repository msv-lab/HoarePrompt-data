You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to reduce `n` to zero by repeatedly subtracting products of two integers derived from `n` and `k`, while keeping track of the number of such operations. If `n` can be reduced to zero within the constraints, it outputs 'YES' followed by the count of operations and the sequence of integers used. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels given she has `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next, buying as many jewels as possible at each stall.

### Key Points
1. Alice's greedy behavior implies that she will buy as many jewels as possible at each stall until she cannot afford more.
2. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.
3. Each stall can have a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

### Analysis of the Program
The program reads multiple test cases, and for each case, it tries to determine if it is possible to create a setup of up to 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

#### Steps in the Program
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `rep` (representing the number of stalls set up), `number` (to store the price per jewel for the current stall), and `tab` (to store the prices of the stalls).
2. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as Alice has coins (`n != 0`), still needs jewels (`k > 0`), has not yet set up 60 stalls (`rep < 60`), and has enough coins to buy at least one jewel at the current stall (`n >= k`).
3. **Price Calculation**: Inside the loop, the program calculates `Min` and `Max` which represent possible prices per jewel. It then decides which price to use based on certain conditions.
4. **Update**: The program updates the number of jewels Alice needs (`k`), the number of coins Alice has (`n`), and the number of stalls set up (`rep`).
5. **Output**: After the loop, if Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels (`k == 0`), the program outputs "YES", the number of stalls, and their prices. Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Logic for Price Calculation**: The logic for calculating `Min` and `Max` and deciding which price to use seems flawed. The conditions used to update `number`, `k`, and `n` do not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
2. **Infinite Loop Risk**: The loop condition `n >= k` might not always ensure that the loop terminates correctly, especially if the prices are not chosen appropriately.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when `n` is very small or `k` is very large.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for determining the prices and ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is flawed, and the program might not handle all edge cases correctly.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
