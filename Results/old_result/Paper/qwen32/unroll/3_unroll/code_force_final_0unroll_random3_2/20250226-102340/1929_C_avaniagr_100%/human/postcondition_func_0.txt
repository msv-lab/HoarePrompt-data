The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function processes up to 1000 test cases.
