Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a critical flaw in how it updates the product of the array elements as it processes each command. Specifically, the program uses integer division (`//`) to remove elements from the product, which is incorrect. Integer division does not accurately reverse the multiplication that was done to include the element in the product. Instead, the program should use modular multiplicative inverses to correctly remove elements from the product under modulo `m`.

Here's a brief explanation of the issue:

- When you multiply numbers and take the result modulo `m`, you need to use the modular multiplicative inverse to "divide" by a number. The modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `m` is a number `x` such that `(a * x) % m = 1`.
- In the program, the line `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` is incorrect because it uses integer division, which does not give the correct result in the context of modular arithmetic.
- Instead, the program should compute the modular multiplicative inverse of the element being removed and multiply the current product by this inverse under modulo `m`.

Since the program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the product, it will not produce the correct results for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
