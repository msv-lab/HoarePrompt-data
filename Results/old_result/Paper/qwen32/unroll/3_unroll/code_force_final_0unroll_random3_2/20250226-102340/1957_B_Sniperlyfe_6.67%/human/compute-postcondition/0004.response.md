Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements, where each element except the last one is the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, and the last element is the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits plus `k`.**

In simpler terms, the list `nums` consists of `n-1` elements, each being the maximum value that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, and the last element is this maximum value plus `k`.
