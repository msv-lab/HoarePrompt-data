The provided code snippet is simply an assignment to the variable `input` which is set to `sys.stdin.readline`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, or `r`. It only sets up a way to read input from standard input, which is a common practice in competitive programming to speed up input reading.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`.**
