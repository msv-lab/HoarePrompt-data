Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input, where each is between 0 and 99 inclusive. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula involving `x` and `y` and prints the result. If only `y` is greater than 0, it prints half of `y` rounded up. If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints `x` divided by 15 rounded up. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.**
