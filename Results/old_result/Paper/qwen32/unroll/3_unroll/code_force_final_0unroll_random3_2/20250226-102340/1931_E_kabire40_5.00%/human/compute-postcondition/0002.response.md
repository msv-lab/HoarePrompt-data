Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of elements in a list and another integer `m`, respectively. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided inputs, but the specific computation or return value for each test case is not detailed in the given output description.**
