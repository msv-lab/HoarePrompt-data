You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the complexities of the prepared problems `A`, the complexities of the models `D`, and the complexities of the functions `F`.
   - The models `D` are sorted and converted to a set to remove duplicates.

2. **Finding Maximum Imbalance:**
   - The program calculates the current maximum and next maximum differences between consecutive problems in `A`.
   - It identifies the index `index` at which the maximum difference occurs.

3. **Calculating Potential New Imbalance:**
   - For each function `f` in `F`, the program attempts to find the best model `d` in `D` such that adding the problem `d + f` minimizes the maximum imbalance.
   - It uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find a suitable position for the new problem in the sorted list of models.
   - It then checks if inserting a problem with complexity `d + f` can reduce the maximum imbalance by comparing the potential new differences.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum imbalance that can be achieved by adding at most one problem.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Function `func_1` and `wrapper`:**
   - These functions are supposed to implement memoization, but they are incorrectly defined and not used in the program. The `d` dictionary and the `wrapper` function are not properly defined or utilized.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where adding a problem cannot reduce the maximum imbalance.
   - It assumes that adding a problem will always reduce the maximum imbalance, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Logic for Finding Minimum Imbalance:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum imbalance is correct in principle but can be optimized and simplified.
   - The use of binary search is appropriate, but the logic for updating the answer (`ans`) is not entirely clear and might not cover all edge cases.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned, particularly the unused and incorrectly defined memoization functions and the potential edge cases not being fully handled, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The program has some logical issues and unused code that suggests it might not handle all edge cases correctly. A more rigorous analysis and testing would be needed to confirm its correctness, but based on the current implementation, it is not correct.
