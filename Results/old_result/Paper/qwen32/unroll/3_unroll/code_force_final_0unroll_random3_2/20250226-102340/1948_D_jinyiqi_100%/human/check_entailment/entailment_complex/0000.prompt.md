Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with 1 <= |s| <= 5000. The total length of all strings s over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The function either prints a value of the form `2 * j` and terminates, or it does not print anything if no such sequence is found.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and determines the longest even-length palindromic substring that can be formed by replacing question marks with appropriate characters. If such a substring exists, it prints its length; otherwise, it prints `0`.
