In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the function `range(int(input()))`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Since the loop will execute `t` times, and we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, we need to set `t` to a value within this range. The other variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the context of each test case but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
