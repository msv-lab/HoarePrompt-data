Output State: **After processing all test cases, the program will have printed the minimum total cost for Kirill to reach his desired position or better for each test case. The variables `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best` will reflect the state of the last processed test case. Specifically, `cases` will remain unchanged, `na_frente` and `pos_final` will hold the values of the last test case, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` will hold the cost lists of the last test case, `total` will be the total cost accumulated during the processing of the last test case, and `best` will be the minimum cost found for Kirill to reach his desired position or better in the last test case.**
