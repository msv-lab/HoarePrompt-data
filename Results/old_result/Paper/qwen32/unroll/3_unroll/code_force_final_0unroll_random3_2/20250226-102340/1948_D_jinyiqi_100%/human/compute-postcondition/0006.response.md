Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and determines the longest even-length palindromic substring that can be formed by replacing question marks with appropriate characters. If such a substring exists, it prints its length; otherwise, it prints `0`.**
