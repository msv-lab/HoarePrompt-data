The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `test_cases`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The variable `x` will be assigned the first element of `test_cases` when the loop starts.

Since `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, it indicates the number of test cases, but the actual list `test_cases` needs to be defined to ensure the loop can execute. The variable `results` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must have at least one integer element within the range 2 <= x <= 1000. The variable `x` will be the first element of `test_cases` when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `test_cases`**
