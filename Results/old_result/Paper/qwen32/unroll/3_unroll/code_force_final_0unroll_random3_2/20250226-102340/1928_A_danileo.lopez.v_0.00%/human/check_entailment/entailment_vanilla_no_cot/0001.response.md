Reasoning:
To determine if Bob can form a different rectangle, we need to analyze the conditions under which he can achieve this. The key insight is that Bob can only form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different shape.

For a rectangle of size \(a \times b\):
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always make a cut parallel to the side of even length, resulting in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then any cut will result in two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b-1}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b+1}{2}\) (or similarly for \(b\) if the cut is parallel to the other side). These two rectangles cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle because they will always result in the same dimensions as the original rectangle when combined.

Thus, the solution checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes", indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle. If both are odd, it prints "No".

The provided program correctly implements this logic.

Correctness: **True**
