Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect and does not produce the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer. The logic in the program does not correctly determine the smallest possible combination of letters that sum up to the given encoded integer. Instead of trying to find the smallest letters first, the program incorrectly handles the distribution of the sum across three letters and sorts them, which does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order.

To find the lexicographically smallest word, the program should start by assigning the smallest possible letter ('a') to the first letter and then distribute the remaining sum to the subsequent letters, ensuring that the sum of the positions of the letters equals the given encoded integer.

For example, for the encoded integer 24, the program should output "aav" (1 + 1 + 22), but the given program might output a different combination due to its incorrect logic.

Correctness: **False**
