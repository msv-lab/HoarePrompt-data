Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes and prints a specific permutation of the list `a` based on certain rules. For each positive element in the list, it assigns the current minimum non-negative integer not yet used, and for each non-positive element, it computes the absolute difference between the element and the current minimum non-negative integer, updating the maximum value encountered. The function prints the resulting permutation for the given list `a`.**
