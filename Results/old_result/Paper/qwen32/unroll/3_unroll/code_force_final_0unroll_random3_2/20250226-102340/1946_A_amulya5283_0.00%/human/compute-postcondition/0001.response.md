The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts, as it is set by the `range` function.

Given that `t` is already described as a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted as it is managed by the `range` function in the for loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and `results` is an empty list**
