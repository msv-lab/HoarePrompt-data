You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

If either `x` or `y` is 0 (or both are 0), the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions specified in the if part hold.

It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula involving `x` and `y` and prints the result. If only `y` is greater than 0, it prints half of `y` rounded up. If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints `x` divided by 15 rounded up. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a positive integer `t` from the user input, and then executes `func_2` exactly `t` times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons**: Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
2. **1x1 Icons**: Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
3. **Screen Capacity**: Each screen can hold a maximum of 15 cells.

### Strategy:
1. **Maximize 2x2 Icon Placement**: Place as many 2x2 icons as possible first since they occupy more space.
2. **Remaining 1x1 Icons**: After placing the 2x2 icons, place the remaining 1x1 icons.
3. **Calculate Screens Needed**: Calculate the number of screens needed based on the remaining cells required for 1x1 icons.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided code:

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`
This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. It is not used anywhere in the program, so it seems unnecessary.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of screens needed for a given pair of `x` and `y`.

1. **Case 1: Both `x > 0` and `y > 0`**:
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (taking up 8 cells each), we need `ceil(y / 2)` screens for 2x2 icons.
   - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. It seems to be trying to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons, but the logic is flawed. It should calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This line is also incorrect. It should calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but the logic is flawed.
   - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This line prints the total number of screens, but due to the incorrect logic in the previous steps, it will not produce the correct result.

2. **Case 2: `x == 0` and `y > 0`**:
   - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.

3. **Case 3: `x > 0` and `y == 0`**:
   - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `x` 1x1 icons.

4. **Case 4: `x == 0` and `y == 0`**:
   - `print(0)`: This correctly returns 0 screens needed.

#### Function `func_3()`
This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program incorrectly handles the case where both `x > 0` and `y > 0`. The logic for calculating the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons and determining the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is flawed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
