The provided code snippet initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, where each element is initially set to `0`. This 2D list is often used in dynamic programming problems to store intermediate results.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input representing the number of cards each player receives.
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand.

The code snippet creates a new variable `dp` and assigns it a 2D list of zeros with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input representing the number of cards each player receives; `cards` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0`.**
