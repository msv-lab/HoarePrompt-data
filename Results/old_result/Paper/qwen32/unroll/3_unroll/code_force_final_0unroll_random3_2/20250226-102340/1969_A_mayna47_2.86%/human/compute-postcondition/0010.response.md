Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` is between 1 and `n`, `p_i` is not equal to `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
