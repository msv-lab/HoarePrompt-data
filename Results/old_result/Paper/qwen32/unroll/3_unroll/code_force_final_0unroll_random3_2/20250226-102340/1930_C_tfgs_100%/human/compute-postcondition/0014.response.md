To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables and the list `ans` are constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **List `a`:**
   - `a` is a list of unique integers derived from an original list.
   - Each integer in the original list at index `i` was incremented by `i + 1`.
   - The list `a` is sorted in descending order after the transformation.

2. **Counter `counter`:**
   - `counter` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in the original list `a` minus 1.

3. **Variable `cur`:**
   - `cur` is the sum of the remaining counts in `counter` after decrementing each by 1.

4. **Variable `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is initially `n - len(a)`, where `n` is the length of the original list.
   - `cnt` is then reduced by the number of elements inserted into `ans` between the elements of `a`.

5. **List `ans`:**
   - `ans` starts with all elements from `a` in their original order.
   - `cnt` additional elements are inserted between the elements of `a`.
   - Each inserted element is one less than the previous element in `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Construction of `ans`:
- **Initial Elements:**
  - `ans` begins with the elements of `a` in their original order.
  
- **Inserting Elements:**
  - Between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, `cnt` additional elements are inserted.
  - Each inserted element is one less than the previous element in `ans`.

### Example to Illustrate the Construction:
Let's assume an example to better understand the construction process:
- Suppose the original list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- After incrementing by `i + 1`, we get `[2, 4, 6]`.
- Sorting in descending order, `a` becomes `[6, 4, 2]`.
- `counter` counts the frequency of `[5, 3, 1]` (which are `a[i] - 1`).
- Suppose `n = 5`, then `cnt` is initially `5 - 3 = 2`.
- `cnt` is reduced by the number of elements inserted between the elements of `a`.

Let's assume `cnt` ends up being 2 after some reduction (the exact reduction depends on the original list and the decrementing process of `counter`).
- We start with `ans = [6, 4, 2]`.
- We insert 2 elements between each pair:
  - Between 6 and 4, insert 5 and 4 (since 5 is one less than 6 and 4 is one less than 5).
  - Between 4 and 2, insert 3 and 2 (since 3 is one less than 4 and 2 is one less than 3).
- The final `ans` becomes `[6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2]`.

### General Description:
The list `ans` will contain the elements of `a` in their original order, with `cnt` additional elements inserted between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`. Each inserted element is one less than the previous element in `ans`.

### Final Output:
Given the general construction process, the output of `print(*ans)` will be the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **elements of `ans` (where `ans` is constructed by starting with the elements of `a` in their original order and inserting `cnt` additional elements between each pair, each inserted element being one less than the previous element in `ans`)**
