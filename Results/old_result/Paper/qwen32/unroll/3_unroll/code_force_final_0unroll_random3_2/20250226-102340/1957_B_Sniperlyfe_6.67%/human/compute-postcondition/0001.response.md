In the given task, the for loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 1, because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

The state before the loop starts includes the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`. However, according to the task, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Since `i` is the loop variable that will be initialized by the `range` function, we do not need to adjust its value before the loop starts. The value of `i` will be set to 0 at the start of the first iteration of the loop.

The variable `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes. The current state already specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, which means `n` is already in a valid range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `nums` is a list of `n` zeros**
