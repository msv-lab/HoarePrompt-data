### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, given that both players play optimally.

1. **Initialization and Counting:**
   - The program initializes a counter array `cntl` to count the occurrences of each integer in the input array `a`.
   - This is done to quickly determine how many times each integer appears in `a`.

2. **Handling the Case When 0 is Absent:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means the number 0 does not appear in `a`. According to the rules of MEX, if 0 is not in the array, the MEX is 0. This is correctly handled by the program.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The program initializes `c` to be the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can add at most 2 zeros to the array `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks the count of each integer in `a`.
   - If the count of an integer `j` is less than 2, it means Alice and Bob cannot both add `j` to `c`. Therefore, `c` is decremented by 1.
   - If `c` becomes 0 or we reach the end of the iteration, the current integer `j` is printed as the MEX.

### Verification with Examples:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `4, [0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0, 0]`.
  - `c` is initialized to `min(2, 2) = 2`.
  - For `j = 1`, `cntl[1]` is 2, so `c` remains 2.
  - For `j = 2`, `cntl[2]` is 0, so `c` is decremented to 1.
  - For `j = 3`, `cntl[3]` is 0, so `c` is decremented to 0.
  - The MEX is 2, which matches the expected output.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `4, [0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - `c` is initialized to `min(2, 1) = 1`.
  - For `j = 1`, `cntl[1]` is 1, so `c` is decremented to 0.
  - The MEX is 1, which matches the expected output.

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `2, [1, 1]`
  - `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`.
  - `c` is initialized to `min(2, 0) = 0`.
  - Since `c` is already 0, the MEX is 0, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the cases as per the provided examples and the logic described. It efficiently calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, considering the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
