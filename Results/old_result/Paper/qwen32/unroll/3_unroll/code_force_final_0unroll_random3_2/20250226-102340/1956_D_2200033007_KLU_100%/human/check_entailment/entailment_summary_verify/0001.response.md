### Reasoning

Let's evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap

- We need to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing operations that replace subarrays with their MEX (Minimum EXcluded Value).
- The operations are limited to no more than 5Â·10^5 times.
- The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Program Analysis

The program consists of three functions:
1. **`func_1`**: Computes the maximum sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` using memoization.
2. **`func_2`**: Generates the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
3. **`make_stairs`**: Constructs a staircase pattern in the array to maximize the sum.

#### Function Summaries and Code Evaluation

1. **`func_1`**:
   - The function uses memoization to store results of subproblems in `res_dict`.
   - The logic seems correct for calculating the maximum sum by considering different subarray splits and MEX values.
   - However, the function does not handle the MEX calculation explicitly. It directly computes the maximum sum based on subarrays and their sums, which might be incorrect if the MEX value is not considered properly.

2. **`func_2`**:
   - This function generates the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It relies on `func_1` to get the maximum sum for different subarrays.
   - The logic for generating operations seems flawed because it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the transformation of the array.
   - The function does not ensure that the operations are correctly formatted or that they maximize the sum as intended.

3. **`make_stairs`**:
   - This function is supposed to transform the array into a staircase pattern.
   - The function modifies the array and appends tuples to `res` indicating the ranges of the modified segments.
   - The function does not correctly handle the transformation to ensure the maximum sum. It incorrectly assumes that setting the array to a staircase pattern will always yield the maximum sum.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Global Variables**: The program uses global variables without declaring them as global in the functions where they are modified.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX for subarrays, which is crucial for determining the correct operations.
3. **Transformation Logic**: The logic for transforming the array to maximize the sum is flawed. The staircase pattern might not always yield the maximum sum.
4. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output as specified in the problem statement.

#### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all valid inputs. The logic for transforming the array and calculating the maximum sum is flawed, and the output format is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
