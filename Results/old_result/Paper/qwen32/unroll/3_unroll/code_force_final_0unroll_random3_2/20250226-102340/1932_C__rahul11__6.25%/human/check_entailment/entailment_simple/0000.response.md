### Reasoning:

The code provided aims to solve the problem as described, but there are a few issues and misunderstandings in the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Modulo Operation Misuse**: The code uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` and applies it inappropriately. The modulo operation should be taken with respect to `m` as specified in the problem, not with an arbitrary large number. The `MOD` variable is not needed in this context.

2. **Division in Modulo Arithmetic**: The code attempts to divide the product by an element of the array using integer division (`ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD`). However, in modulo arithmetic, division is not straightforward and requires the use of modular multiplicative inverses. Integer division does not work correctly in this context.

3. **Correctness of Product Calculation**: The initial product `ans` is calculated as the product of all elements in the array. This is correct, but as mentioned, the subsequent divisions need to be handled with modular arithmetic correctly.

4. **Handling Large Inputs**: Given the constraints, especially the large possible values of `n` and the sum of `n` across all test cases, the program must be efficient. The current implementation recalculates the product modulo `m` at each step, which is inefficient.

### Correct Implementation Approach:

To correctly handle the problem, we need to:

- Calculate the initial product modulo `m`.
- Use modular multiplicative inverses to handle division in modulo arithmetic.
- Ensure that the program runs efficiently within the given constraints.

### Revised Code:

Here's a revised version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
def mod_inverse(a, m):
    m0, x0, x1 = m, 0, 1
    if m == 1:
        return 0
    while a > 1:
        # q is quotient
        q = a // m
        m, a = a % m, m
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    # Make x1 positive
    if x1 < 0:
        x1 += m0
    return x1

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input().strip()
        
        res = []
        
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        
        res.append(ans)
        
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[l], m)) % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[r], m)) % m
                r -= 1
            res.append(ans)
        
        print(*res)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original code is incorrect due to the misuse of the modulo operation and the incorrect handling of division in modular arithmetic. The revised code above addresses these issues.

**Correctness: False**
