### Reasoning:

The program's logic is based on counting pairs \((i, j)\) in the array such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

To achieve this, the program uses a residue map to keep track of the number of elements seen so far that have specific residues when divided by \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, for each element \(a_i\), the program considers:
- \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\)
- \(r_y = a_i \mod y\)

The key idea is that for a pair \((i, j)\) to be beautiful, the residues of \(a_j\) must satisfy:
- \(-a_j \mod x = r_x\)
- \(a_j \mod y = r_y\)

This is equivalent to:
- \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\)
- \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\)

The program correctly updates the count of beautiful pairs by checking how many previous elements have the required residues and then updates the residue map with the current element's residues.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first example provided:

**Input:**
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```

**Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The pairs \((1, 5)\) and \((4, 6)\) are beautiful:
  - For \((1, 5)\):
    - \(a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10\) (divisible by 5)
    - \(a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8\) (divisible by 2)
  - For \((4, 6)\):
    - \(a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10\) (divisible by 5)
    - \(a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2\) (divisible by 2)

The program correctly identifies these pairs and counts them.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the program is correct.
