The code snippet provided is a function call `make_stairs(i - 1)`. This means the function `make_stairs` is being called with the argument `i - 1`. The impact of this function call on the current state depends on the implementation of the `make_stairs` function, which is not provided. However, we can infer the changes to the state based on the given information and typical function behavior.

Given that `make_stairs` is presumably a recursive function or modifies the state in some way, we need to consider the updated value of `i` after the function call and any changes to `start_index` and `is_already_stairs` that might occur within `make_stairs`.

Since the function call does not directly modify `i`, `start_index`, or `is_already_stairs` in the provided snippet, we assume that the function `make_stairs` modifies these variables. However, without the function's implementation, we can only infer that `i` is passed as `i - 1` to the function.

Thus, the updated state will reflect the changes made by `make_stairs(i - 1)`. Since the exact changes are unknown, we can only specify that `i` has been passed as `i - 1` to the function.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**
