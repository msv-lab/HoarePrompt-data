You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and x ≠ y. There are t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = abs(n - m)
        
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif k % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = k - q
            while f & f - 1 != 0:
                l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
                p = len(l)
                q = 2 ** (p - 1)
                f = f - q
            print(f)
        
    #State: A series of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is determined by the logic described above for the corresponding pair of integers (n, m).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` for each of the `t` test cases, where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9` and `x ≠ y`. It returns the smaller of the two integers `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
