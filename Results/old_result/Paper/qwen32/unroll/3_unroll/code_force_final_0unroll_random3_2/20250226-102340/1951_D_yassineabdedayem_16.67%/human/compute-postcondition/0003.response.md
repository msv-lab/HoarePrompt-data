To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the provided code does in each test case. Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

1. **Input Reading**: For each of the `t` test cases, the code reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Loop Initialization**: Initializes `rep` (repetition counter), `number` (to store intermediate results), and `tab` (a list to store the sequence of numbers).
3. **Main Loop**: The loop continues as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    - It calculates `Min` and `Max` as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
    - Depending on the values of `Max` and `n * Min`, it updates `number` and `k`.
    - It appends `number` to `tab` and reduces `n` by `Min * Max`.
    - It increments `rep` by 1.
4. **Output**: After the loop, if `k` is zero, it prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and the elements of `tab`. If `k` is not zero, it prints 'NO'.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the output state will depend on whether `k` is reduced to zero within the constraints of the loop. Let's summarize the output state in terms of the variables:

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k`: For each test case, `n` and `k` are read and modified within the loop. After the loop, `n` and `k` are not output but are used to determine the output ('YES' or 'NO').
- `rep`: This variable is used to prevent infinite loops and is reset for each test case.
- `number`: This variable stores intermediate results and is not output directly but is used to build `tab`.
- `tab`: This list stores the sequence of numbers generated during the loop and is printed if `k` is reduced to zero.

The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, along with the length and contents of `tab` if 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **For each test case, the output will be either 'YES' followed by the length of the list `tab` and the elements of `tab`, or 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` will be in a state determined by the execution of the loop for that test case.**
