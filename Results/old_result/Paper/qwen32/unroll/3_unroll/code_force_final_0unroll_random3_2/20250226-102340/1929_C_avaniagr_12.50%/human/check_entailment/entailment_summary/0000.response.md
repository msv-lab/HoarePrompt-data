Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any positive integer `n` by placing bets under the given conditions. The logic in the program is based on the following observations:

1. **Case 1: x < k - 1**
   - If the maximum number of consecutive losses `x` is less than `k - 1`, Sasha can use a strategy where he bets `1` coin if he won the previous bet or if it's his first bet. If he loses, he bets `2` coins. This strategy ensures that he can recover from a loss by winning the next bet and gaining more coins than he lost. However, he needs at least `x + 1` coins to ensure he can cover the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and still have a coin to bet after those losses.

2. **Case 2: x == k - 1**
   - If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, the strategy needs to be more conservative because the loss recovery mechanism is tighter. Sasha needs to ensure he has enough coins to cover `x` consecutive losses and still have enough to bet after those losses. The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to handle the worst-case scenario and still have coins left to bet.

3. **Case 3: x > k - 1**
   - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, the program calculates the minimum number of coins `z` Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses. It does this by simulating the process of losing `x` times in a row and calculating the minimum number of coins required to recover from that scenario. The condition `a >= z` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to handle the worst-case scenario and still have coins left to bet.

The execution summary indicates that the function correctly processes multiple test cases and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions described above. The logic in the program aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
