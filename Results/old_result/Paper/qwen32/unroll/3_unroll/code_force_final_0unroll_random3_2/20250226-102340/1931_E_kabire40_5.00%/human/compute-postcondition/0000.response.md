In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `y` is used as the loop counter. Since the loop is controlled by the variable `y` and the number of iterations `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `y` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.
2. The number of iterations `t` is determined by the input, and it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This means `t` is already in a valid state to ensure the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state of `y` is necessary because it is managed by the `range` function. The only state that needs to be ensured is that `t` is at least 1, which is already provided in the problem statement.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
