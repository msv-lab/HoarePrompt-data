Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); y is 0. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The current environment is the main module, indicated by `__name__ == '__main__'`.**

In this output state, `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, while `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial conditions. The second line of each test case and the environment condition remain unchanged.
