### Reasoning:

The program is designed to find all possible values of \( k \) given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received during the settling \( x \). The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the program uses this periodicity to determine the valid values of \( k \).

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).

2. **Finding Possible \( k \) Values:**
   - The program checks whether \( (n + x - 2) \) is even. If it is, it finds the divisors of \( (n + x - 2) \) using the function `func_1`.
   - Similarly, it checks whether \( (n - x) \) is even. If it is, it finds the divisors of \( (n - x) \).
   - For each divisor \( s \) found, it checks if \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to \( x \). If both conditions are met, it adds \( (s + 2) / 2 \) to the list of possible \( k \) values.
   - The list of possible \( k \) values is then converted to a set to remove duplicates and converted back to a list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of a given number \( x \) and returns them in a specific order: first the divisors greater than or equal to the square root of \( x \), followed by the divisors less than or equal to the square root of \( x \) in reverse order.

### Analysis of the Program:

- The program correctly identifies the periodicity of the settling pattern, which is \( 2k - 2 \).
- It correctly checks the conditions for \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) being even.
- It correctly calculates the divisors of these values and checks if they can form valid \( k \) values.
- The use of a set to remove duplicates ensures that each \( k \) value is counted only once.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently finds all possible values of \( k \) that fit the given constraints.

**Correctness: **True**
