The code snippet `ans += (n - k) * a` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `(n - k) * a` to it. Initially, `ans` is `k * b`. After the operation, `ans` becomes `k * b + (n - k) * a`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`.**
