You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of tuples `q`, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` containing the divisors of `n` from each tuple in `q` that are greater than or equal to `x`. However, due to an error in the code, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to compute the square root of `q`, which is a list instead of a number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is undefined**: The code references a function `func_1` which is not defined in the provided code snippet. This will cause a `NameError` when the code is executed.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining `k` values**: The logic to determine the valid `k` values seems flawed. The approach used in the code does not correctly map Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` to the correct `k` values as described in the problem statement.

3. **Handling of edge cases**: The code does not handle certain edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is very large, the logic might not work as expected due to the way `k` values are calculated.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Example Input:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
For `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the valid `k` values are `2`, `3`, `5`, and `6`. The code provided does not correctly identify these values due to the issues mentioned above.

Since the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and does not handle the cases correctly, it is incorrect.
