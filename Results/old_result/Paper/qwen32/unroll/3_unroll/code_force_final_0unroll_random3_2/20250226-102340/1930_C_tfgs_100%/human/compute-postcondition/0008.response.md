`cnt` is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`. The values of `a`, `counter`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each integer at index `i` was the original integer at that index plus `i + 1`, sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the original list `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
