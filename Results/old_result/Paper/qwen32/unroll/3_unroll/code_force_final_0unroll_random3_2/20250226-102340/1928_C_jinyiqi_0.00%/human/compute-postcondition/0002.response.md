The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the range is valid, meaning `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` should be greater than `1`.

Given the initial state that `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`, we can deduce that `x` is at least 1, and thus `x ** 0.5` is at least 1, making `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` at least 2. This means the range will always be valid and the loop will execute at least once as long as `x` is at least 1.

However, since the task specifies that we must adhere to the text format and only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and since the initial conditions already ensure the loop will execute, no adjustments are strictly necessary for the loop to run.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list**
