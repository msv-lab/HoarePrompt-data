You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Output

    1 1
    
Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Otherwise, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) are all set to `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, which may modify `res` and other variables in its scope.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` modifies the array `arr` by setting segments of it to specific values based on the current index `i` and the starting index `start_index`. It also appends tuples to the list `res` indicating the ranges of the modified segments in `arr`. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Upon reviewing the provided program, there are several issues that indicate it may not correctly solve the problem as described:

1. **Incomplete Function Definitions**: The function `make_stairs` relies on a variable `start_index` which is not defined within the function or passed as a parameter. This will lead to a `NameError` when `make_stairs` is called.

2. **Global Variables**: The program uses global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without defining them within the functions. This can lead to undefined behavior and is generally bad practice.

3. **Logic Errors**: The logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array is incomplete and not clearly defined. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum for a given subarray, but the logic to achieve this is not well-explained or correctly implemented. The function `func_2` is supposed to return the sequence of operations, but it relies on the results from `func_1` which might not be correctly computed.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with all elements being zero, or arrays with a single element. While the examples provided might work, it is not clear that the program will work for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

5. **Output Format**: The program does not output the required format. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the sequence of operations. The current implementation does not produce this output.

6. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_1` and `func_2` can lead to excessive recursion depth for larger arrays, which is not handled by the program.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
