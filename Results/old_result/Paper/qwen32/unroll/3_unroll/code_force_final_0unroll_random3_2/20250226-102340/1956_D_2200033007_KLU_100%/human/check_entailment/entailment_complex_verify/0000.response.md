### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### 1. **Incomplete Function Definitions and Global Variables:**
   - **Issue:** The function `make_stairs` references a variable `start_index` which is not defined within the function or passed as a parameter, leading to a `NameError`.
   - **Annotation Review:** The annotations mention that `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the segment of the array `arr` that is being processed. However, the function `make_stairs` does not have `start_index` as a parameter, which is incorrect.
   - **Conclusion:** This is indeed an issue.

#### 2. **Logic Errors:**
   - **Issue:** The logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array is not well-explained or correctly implemented.
   - **Annotation Review:** The annotations provide a detailed explanation of what each function is supposed to do. `func_1` computes the maximum possible sum for a given subarray, and `func_2` returns the sequence of operations. However, the annotations do not provide a step-by-step breakdown of the logic to ensure correctness.
   - **Conclusion:** The annotations suggest that the logic should be correct, but the implementation details are not fully explained.

#### 3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Issue:** The program might not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with all elements being zero, or arrays with a single element.
   - **Annotation Review:** The annotations do not explicitly address edge cases, but the examples provided in the problem description cover some edge cases.
   - **Conclusion:** The annotations do not provide enough evidence to confirm that all edge cases are handled correctly.

#### 4. **Output Format:**
   - **Issue:** The program should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the sequence of operations.
   - **Annotation Review:** The annotations confirm that the program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the sequence of operations.
   - **Conclusion:** The output format is correct based on the annotations.

#### 5. **Recursive Calls:**
   - **Issue:** The recursive calls in `func_1` and `func_2` can lead to excessive recursion depth for larger arrays.
   - **Annotation Review:** The annotations do not mention recursion depth issues, but the problem constraints specify that `n` can be as large as 18, which is manageable for recursion.
   - **Conclusion:** Given the constraints, recursion depth should not be an issue.

### Evaluation:

While the annotations provide a good explanation of what the functions are supposed to do, the implementation has significant issues:
- **Incomplete Function Definitions:** The `make_stairs` function lacks the `start_index` parameter, which is a critical flaw.
- **Global Variables:** The use of global variables without proper definition within functions is a bad practice and can lead to undefined behavior.
- **Logic Errors:** The logic to compute the MEX and maximize the sum is not fully explained or clearly implemented.

The annotations do not provide enough evidence to completely justify the correctness of the program, especially given the identified issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
