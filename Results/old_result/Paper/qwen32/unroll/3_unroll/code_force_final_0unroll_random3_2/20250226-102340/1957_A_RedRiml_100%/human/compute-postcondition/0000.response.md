The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `w`. The initial state describes a scenario involving multiple test cases, each with a number of sticks and their respective lengths, but the code snippet only involves reading a single integer.

Output State: **`w` is an integer input (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), the number of test cases. The description of test cases (number of sticks and their lengths) remains unchanged.**
