Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints an index `ans` that is closest to the middle of the string `a` while satisfying specific conditions related to the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the index.**
