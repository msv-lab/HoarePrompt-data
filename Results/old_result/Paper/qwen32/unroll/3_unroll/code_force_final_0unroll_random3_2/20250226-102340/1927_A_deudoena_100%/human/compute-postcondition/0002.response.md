The code snippet `s = input()` reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means that `s` will now hold the string value of the input for the current test case. The other variables (`t`, `ma`, `mi`, `m`, `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that there is at least one 'B' in the string s. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer. `s` is the input string for the current test case.**
