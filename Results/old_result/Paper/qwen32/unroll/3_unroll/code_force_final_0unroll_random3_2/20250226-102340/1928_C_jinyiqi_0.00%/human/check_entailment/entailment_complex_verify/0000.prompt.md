You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)

            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1

    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list of divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, followed by a list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, followed by a list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is called within the main loop, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incomplete Output Handling:** The program calculates potential values for `k` and stores them in the `output` list. However, it does not print the length of the `output` list, which is required by the problem statement.

3. **Logic Errors in Calculating `k`:** The logic for calculating `k` seems to be incorrect. The program attempts to use divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` to determine possible values of `k`, but it does not correctly account for the repeating pattern described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the condition that `k` must be greater than 1 and that the pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

4. **Integer Division:** The program uses `/` for division, which results in a float. Since `k` must be an integer, the program should use `//` for integer division.

To illustrate the issues, let's consider a simple test case:

**Input:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will raise a `NameError` due to the undefined `func_1` function.

Even if the `func_1` function were defined correctly, the logic for calculating `k` and handling the output would need to be corrected to match the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
