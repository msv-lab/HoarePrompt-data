Reasoning:  
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The key observation is that each move either increases or decreases the number of cubes by 1. Therefore, after `n` moves, the difference between the number of cubes we end up with (`m`) and the number of cubes we start with (0) must be an integer that can be achieved by a combination of adding and removing cubes.

Since the starting number of cubes is 0, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of moves is required to achieve an even difference. Additionally, `n - m` must be non-negative because you can't have more cubes than moves.

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).
- It checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

Thus, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
