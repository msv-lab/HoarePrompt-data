The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `sb`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, or `sa`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the creation of the `sb` list, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers reflecting 'F' relationships, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers reflecting 'S' relationships, `xx` is a list of `n + 1` strings, where the first string is an empty string and the remaining `n` strings are the input strings, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is an empty list.**
