You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case is a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines if the string can be split into two non-empty parts such that one part is a prefix and the other is a suffix of the original string and they are different. If such a split is possible, it outputs 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting split string(s). If no such split is possible, it outputs 'NO'. The input strings remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Overview
The task is to partition a given string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome. If such a partition is possible, the program should output "YES", followed by the number of parts `k` and the parts themselves. If it's not possible, the program should output "NO".

### Program Analysis
1. **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single-character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs "NO".
2. **First and Last Characters Check**: If the first and last characters of the string are different, the program outputs "YES" and suggests the entire string as a partition, since a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.
3. **Uniform Strings**: If all characters in the string are the same, the program outputs "NO" because any partition of such a string will result in palindromic substrings.
4. **String with One Different Character**: If the string has all characters the same except for one, the program checks if the middle character (if the string length is odd) is different from the others. If it is, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it suggests the entire string as a partition.
5. **General Case**: For other strings, the program checks for the first pair of characters from the start and end that are not the same. If such a pair is found, it suggests the entire string as a partition. If no such pair is found, it tries to find a valid partition by checking for the first character that is different from the first character and then checking if the substring up to that character can be a valid partition.
6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles some edge cases, such as strings with repeating patterns, but it does not handle all possible cases correctly.

### Issues in the Program
The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle all cases where a valid partition exists but the program outputs "NO". For example:
- In the case of the string "ababa", the program might output "NO" because it doesn't correctly identify that the string can be partitioned into "ab" and "aba", or "aba" and "ba".
- The program incorrectly assumes that if a substring from the start to a certain point is a palindrome, it cannot be part of a valid partition. However, it can be part of a valid partition if the remaining substring is non-palindromic.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly handle all cases and can output "NO" for strings that can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
Correctness: **False**
