The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three indices \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) such that the elements at these indices in the list are equal. The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The result for each test case is printed directly.
