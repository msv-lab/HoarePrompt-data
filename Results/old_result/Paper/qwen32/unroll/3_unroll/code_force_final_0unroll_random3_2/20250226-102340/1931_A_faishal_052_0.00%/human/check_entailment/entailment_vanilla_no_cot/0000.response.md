Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Filling the Array**: The logic for filling the array `arr` is flawed. The program incorrectly handles the cases where the remaining sum `lex` is less than or equal to 26 or less than 52. It should ensure that the smallest possible values are assigned to the first two positions to achieve the lexicographically smallest word.

2. **Handling the Remaining Sum**: After assigning values to the first two positions, the remaining sum should be assigned to the third position. However, the program does not handle this correctly, especially when the remaining sum is greater than 26.

3. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array `arr` does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. The program should assign the smallest possible values to the first two positions and then the remaining value to the third position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters
        if lex <= 52:
            first = min(lex - 2, 26)
            second = lex - first - 1
            third = 1
        else:
            first = 26
            second = min(26, lex - 26 - 1)
            third = lex - first - second
        print(chr(first + 96) + chr(second + 96) + chr(third + 96))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the first two letters are assigned the smallest possible values while still allowing the third letter to sum up to the given encoded integer, thus ensuring the lexicographically smallest word.
