Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the program is incorrect and does not account for the overlaps of fireworks from both installations over time.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to determine the points in time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible. This involves considering the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the intervals `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of the fireworks launches and then calculating the overlaps within each period.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        
        for t in range(lcm_ab):
            count = 0
            if t % a <= m:
                count += m // a + 1
            if t % b <= m:
                count += m // b + 1
            if t % a <= m and t % b <= m and (t % a == t % b or (t % a + a <= t % b and t % b <= t % a + m) or (t % b + b <= t % a and t % a <= t % b + m)):
                count -= 1
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program calculates the LCM of `a` and `b` to determine the period over which we need to check the overlaps. It then iterates through each minute in this period to count the number of fireworks visible and updates the maximum count found. The condition for overlapping fireworks is also correctly handled.
