You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description to determine if it's correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves performing a series of swap operations on an array where initially, `a_i = i`. The swap operation `swap(k)` swaps the elements at positions `d` and `k`, where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` that is not equal to `k` itself. The task is to determine the final position of the element `1` after performing all `swap(i)` operations for `i` from `2` to `n`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Array**: The initial array is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
2. **Swap Operation**: For each `k` from `2` to `n`, the largest divisor `d` of `k` (excluding `k` itself) is found, and the elements at positions `d` and `k` are swapped.
3. **Final Position of `1`**: The problem requires finding the position of `1` after all swaps.

### Pattern Recognition:
The position of `1` after all swaps can be deduced by observing the behavior of the swaps:
- For a number `n` that is a power of 2 (`n = 2^k`), the position of `1` after all swaps is `2^(k+1)`.
- For other values of `n`, the position of `1` is `2^k`, where `k` is the largest integer such that `2^k <= n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine the final position of `1` based on the above pattern:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and the value of `n` for each test case.
2. **Special Case for `n = 1`**: If `n` is `1`, it directly prints `1` (since no swaps are performed).
3. **Determine Power of 2**:
   - It initializes `power` to `1`.
   - It increments `power` until `2^power` exceeds `log2(n)`.
   - If `power` equals `n`, it prints `2^power`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `2^(power-1)`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for determining the power of 2 is flawed. The program is incorrectly comparing `power` with `log2(n)` and performing exponentiation.
- The condition `if power == n` is incorrect. The program should be determining the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
- The final calculation `2^power` or `2^(power-1)` is not correctly reflecting the position of `1`.

### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
- Print `2^(k+1)` if `n` is a power of 2.
- Otherwise, print `2^k`.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            k = 0
            while (1 << k) <= n:
                k += 1
            if (1 << k) == n:
                print(1 << (k + 1))
            else:
                print(1 << (k - 1))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the final position of `1` after the swaps. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
