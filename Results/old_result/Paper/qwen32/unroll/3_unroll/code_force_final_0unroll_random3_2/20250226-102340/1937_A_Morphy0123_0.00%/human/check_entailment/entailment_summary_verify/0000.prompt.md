You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it outputs the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is 1, it outputs 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly determine the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the described operations for every potential case. There are several issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Power**:
   - The code uses `log2(n)` to determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. However, the calculation `while power < log2(n):` is incorrect because `power` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, which does not correctly compute the power of 2.
   - The logic to determine the power of 2 is flawed. The correct approach would involve finding the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where `n` is a power of 2. For instance, if `n` is a power of 2, the code should return `2 ** power` directly, but the current implementation incorrectly checks `if power == n`, which is never true.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The core logic of finding the position of 1 after performing the swaps is not correctly implemented. The code does not simulate the swapping operations as described in the problem statement.

Here is a correct implementation of the problem:

```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
            power = 1
            while (1 << power) <= n:
                power += 1
            power -= 1
            print(1 << power)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation correctly finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and prints `2 ** power` as the position of 1 in the resulting array. This matches the expected behavior for all test cases, including edge cases like when `n` is a power of 2.
