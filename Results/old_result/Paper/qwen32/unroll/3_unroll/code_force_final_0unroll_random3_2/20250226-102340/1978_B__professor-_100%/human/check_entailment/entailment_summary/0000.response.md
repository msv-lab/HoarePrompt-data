### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. The logic in the program is based on three distinct scenarios:

1. **When `b <= a`:**
   - In this case, selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit.
   - The formula used is `n * a`, which correctly computes the total profit by multiplying the number of buns by the usual price.

2. **When `b - a >= n`:**
   - Here, the maximum profit is achieved by selling all buns at the modified price.
   - The formula used is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each step. This correctly computes the total profit when all buns are sold at the modified price.

3. **When `b > a` and `b - a < n`:**
   - In this scenario, selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit.
   - The formula used is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`. This formula calculates the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the modified prices and adds the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.

The program correctly handles all three scenarios and computes the maximum profit for each test case. The execution summary aligns with the problem description and the program's logic.

### Correctness:
**True**
