To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the code and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State and Given Information:
- `x` and `y` are integers.
- `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`.
- `x` is explicitly given as `0`.
- `y` is greater than `0` (so `1 <= y <= 99`).

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Importing the `math` module**: Although not explicitly shown, we assume that the `math` module is imported to use the `math.ceil` function.
2. **Expression inside `print`**: The expression `y / 2` calculates the division of `y` by `2`.
3. **Applying `math.ceil`**: The `math.ceil` function rounds the result of `y / 2` up to the nearest integer.

### Calculation:
- Since `y` is an integer greater than `0` and less than or equal to `99`, `y / 2` will be a float value.
- The `math.ceil` function will round this float value up to the nearest integer.

### Example Calculation:
- If `y` is `1`, `y / 2` is `0.5`, and `math.ceil(0.5)` is `1`.
- If `y` is `2`, `y / 2` is `1.0`, and `math.ceil(1.0)` is `1`.
- If `y` is `3`, `y / 2` is `1.5`, and `math.ceil(1.5)` is `2`.
- If `y` is `99`, `y / 2` is `49.5`, and `math.ceil(49.5)` is `50`.

### General Description:
Given the range of `y` (1 to 99), the value of `math.ceil(y / 2)` will be an integer ranging from `1` to `50`.

### Output:
The output will be the result of `math.ceil(y / 2)` for the given value of `y`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)**
