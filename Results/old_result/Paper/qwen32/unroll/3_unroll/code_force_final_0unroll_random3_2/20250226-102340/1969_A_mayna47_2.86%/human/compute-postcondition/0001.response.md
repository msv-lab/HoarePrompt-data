The code snippet initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**
