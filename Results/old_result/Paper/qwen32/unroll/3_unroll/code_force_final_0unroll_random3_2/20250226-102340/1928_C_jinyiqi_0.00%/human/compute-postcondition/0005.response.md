The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. The elements in `output2` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `n` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is a list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order; `output2` is a list of divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
