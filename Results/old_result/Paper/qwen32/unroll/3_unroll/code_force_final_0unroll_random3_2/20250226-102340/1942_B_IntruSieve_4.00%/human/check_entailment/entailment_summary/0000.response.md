### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by constructing a permutation `p` based on the provided array `a`. The program's approach is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `minn` to 0, which keeps track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`. It also initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`.

2. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element in the array `a`:
     - If the element is positive, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and then increments `minn` by 1. If `minn` equals `maxx` (which is initially 0), it sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`. This ensures that `minn` always points to the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
     - If the element is non-positive, it calculates the absolute difference between the element and `minn` and appends this value to the `mex` list. It also updates `maxx` if the calculated value is greater than `maxx`.

3. **Output**: After processing all elements, the program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**: The approach is based on the definition of the MEX function and the problem statement. The program ensures that for each element in `a`, it correctly computes the corresponding element in `p` such that the MEX condition is satisfied.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles both positive and non-positive elements in `a` appropriately. For positive elements, it directly assigns the smallest unused non-negative integer, and for non-positive elements, it computes the absolute difference with `minn`, ensuring that the MEX condition holds.
- **Efficiency**: The program runs in O(n) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the provided array `a` and the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
