To determine the output of the `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)` statement, we need to understand the values of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` based on the given initial state.

1. **Understanding `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory` is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.
   - Mathematically, this is represented as `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

2. **Understanding `bxsfory1`:**
   - `bxsfory1` is defined as `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
   - This means we need to evaluate `x` first to determine the value of `bxsfory1`.

3. **Evaluating `x`:**
   - The initial state provides the formula for `x`: `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - However, this formula seems recursive or circularly defined without an initial value for `x`. To proceed, let's assume we have an initial value for `x` before this formula is applied. Let's denote this initial value as `x_initial`.
   - Applying the formula: `x = x_initial - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.

4. **Determining `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` with respect to `x` and `y`:**
   - Since `y` is greater than 0, `bxsfory` will be a positive integer.
   - The value of `bxsfory1` will depend on the value of `x` after the formula is applied.

Given the circular nature of the definition of `x`, let's assume a specific scenario to illustrate the calculation. Suppose we start with an initial `x_initial` and `y`.

Let's assume:
- `y = 10` (since `y` is greater than 0).
- `x_initial = 100` (an arbitrary initial value for `x`).

Now, calculate `bxsfory`:
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(10 / 2) = math.ceil(5) = 5`.

Next, calculate `x` using the formula:
- `x = 100 - 5 * 15 + 10 * 4 = 100 - 75 + 40 = 65`.

Now, calculate `bxsfory1`:
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(65 / 15) + 1 = math.ceil(4.33) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`.

Finally, calculate the output of the print statement:
- `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory) = print(6 + 5) = print(11)`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`, which we have calculated as 11 in this specific scenario.

Output: **11 (where bxsfory is math.ceil(y / 2) and bxsfory1 is 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1, with x calculated as x_initial - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4)**
