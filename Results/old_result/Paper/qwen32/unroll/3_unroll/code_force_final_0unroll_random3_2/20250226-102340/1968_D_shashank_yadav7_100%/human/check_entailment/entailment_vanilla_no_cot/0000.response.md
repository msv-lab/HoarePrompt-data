Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum score that each player can achieve over the course of the game. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the scores by assuming that the maximum score for each player is achieved by either staying in the same position or moving to the next position in the permutation, but it does not account for the possibility of looping or repeating positions.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program calculates the score for each player by multiplying the current position's score by the remaining number of turns and compares it with the current score. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of looping or repeating positions, which can lead to higher scores.

2. **Loop Detection:**
   - The program does not detect cycles in the permutation. If a player enters a cycle, they can continue to collect points from the cycle for the remaining turns. The program does not handle this scenario correctly.

3. **Incorrect Use of `k`:**
   - The variable `k` is decremented in each iteration of the loop, but the logic for calculating the scores is not correct. The program should simulate the game for `k` turns and keep track of the scores for each player.

4. **Handling of Large `k`:**
   - The value of `k` can be as large as \(10^9\), which means the program should efficiently handle cases where the game goes on for a long time. The current implementation does not handle this efficiently.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Detect cycles in the permutation.
- Simulate the game for `k` turns, taking into account the possibility of looping.
- Calculate the scores correctly by considering the points collected in each turn and the points collected in cycles.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        b = int(data[index + 2]) - 1
        s = int(data[index + 3]) - 1
        index += 4
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        a = list(map(int, data[index + n:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        
        def calculate_score(start):
            score = 0
            visited = [False] * n
            cycle_score = 0
            cycle_length = 0
            in_cycle = False
            
            pos = start
            for _ in range(k):
                if visited[pos]:
                    if not in_cycle:
                        in_cycle = True
                        cycle_start = pos
                        cycle_length = 0
                        cycle_score = 0
                    cycle_length += 1
                    cycle_score += a[pos]
                else:
                    visited[pos] = True
                    score += a[pos]
                
                pos = p[pos] - 1
                if in_cycle and pos == cycle_start:
                    break
            
            if in_cycle:
                remaining_turns = k - cycle_length
                full_cycles = remaining_turns // cycle_length
                remaining_turns %= cycle_length
                score += full_cycles * cycle_score
                for _ in range(remaining_turns):
                    score += a[pos]
                    pos = p[pos] - 1
            
            return score
        
        bodya_score = calculate_score(b)
        sasha_score = calculate_score(s)
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version handles cycles and efficiently calculates the scores for each player over `k` turns.
