Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` made up of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The function processes each string `s` and returns a result for each test case. If the string contains question marks, the function replaces them with lowercase Latin letters in such a way that the resulting string is a palindrome. If it is not possible to form a palindrome, the function returns "NO" for that test case. If a palindrome can be formed, it returns "YES" followed by the palindrome string.**
