Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer; there are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, n is the number of people in the queue excluding Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill in the queue. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are the costs Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are the additional costs Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th person during a swap (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
