### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it accurately computes the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on the 5x3 grid screens.

**Key Points to Verify:**
1. **Grid Capacity:** Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which can accommodate 15 1x1 icons or a combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
2. **2x2 Icon Placement:** Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since the grid is 5x3, a maximum of 2 2x2 icons can be placed on a single screen (8 cells used, 7 cells remaining for 1x1 icons).
3. **Optimal Placement Strategy:** The program should first place as many 2x2 icons as possible, then place the remaining 1x1 icons on the available space.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_2()`:
- **Case 1:** Both `x` (1x1 icons) and `y` (2x2 icons) are greater than 0.
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons, we need `ceil(y / 2)` screens.
  - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This step is incorrect. It should only account for the 1x1 space left after placing the 2x2 icons. Correct calculation would be `x = x - bxsfory * 4` (since each 2x2 icon uses 4 1x1 spaces).
  - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The `+1` is incorrect because it adds an extra screen unnecessarily.
- **Case 2:** `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
  - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: Correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
- **Case 3:** `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.
  - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: Correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
- **Case 4:** Both `x` and `y` are 0.
  - `print(0)`: Correctly outputs 0 screens needed.

### Correctness:
The logic in `func_2()` is flawed, particularly in how it handles the placement of 2x2 and 1x1 icons together. The program incorrectly calculates the remaining 1x1 icons and adds unnecessary screens.

**Correctness: **False**
