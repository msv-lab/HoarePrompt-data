To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and understand how the variables change during the loop's execution.

### Initial State Recap:
- `N` is the first integer read from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a` with an additional `-1` at the end.
- `s` is initialized to 0.
- `e` is initialized to 0.
- `num` is initialized to `nums[0]`.
- `arr` is initialized as an empty list.

### Code Analysis:
The loop iterates from `0` to `N` (inclusive), meaning it will run `N + 1` times. During each iteration:
- If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr` and updates `s` to the current index `i`.
- Regardless of the condition, `num` is updated to `nums[i]`.

### Output State Explanation:
- `N` remains unchanged as it is only read once at the beginning.
- `nums` remains unchanged as it is only read during the loop iterations.
- `s` and `num` will be updated during the loop, but their final values depend on the contents of `nums`.
- `arr` will be populated with tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.

### Final Values:
- `s` will be the last index where a new segment started, which is the index of the last element in `nums` that is different from its predecessor.
- `num` will be the last element in `nums`, which is `-1` due to the additional `-1` at the end of `nums`.
- `arr` will contain tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`N` is the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a` with an additional `-1` at the end, `s` is the last index where a new segment started, `e` is 0 (unchanged), `num` is `-1` (the last element in `nums`), `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.**
