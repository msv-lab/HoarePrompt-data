Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always find the integer \( y \) (1 \le y < x) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximum possible. The program simply takes \( y = \frac{x}{2} \), which is not guaranteed to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

Let's consider a counterexample:

For \( x = 10 \):
- The program outputs \( y = 5 \).
- However, \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).

But, if we try \( y = 9 \):
- \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \).

In this case, both \( y = 5 \) and \( y = 9 \) give the same result, but let's consider another example:

For \( x = 7 \):
- The program outputs \( y = 3 \).
- \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).

But, if we try \( y = 6 \):
- \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).

Here, \( y = 6 \) gives a higher value than \( y = 3 \).

Thus, the program does not always find the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
