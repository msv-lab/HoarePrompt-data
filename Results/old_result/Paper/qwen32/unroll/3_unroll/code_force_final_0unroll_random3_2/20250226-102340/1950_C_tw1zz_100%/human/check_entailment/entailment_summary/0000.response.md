Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly handles the conversion of time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description. It iterates through each test case, splits the input time into hours and minutes, and then uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the correct 12-hour format and whether it should be AM or PM. The program correctly handles edge cases such as midnight ('00:00') and noon ('12:00'). The output format matches the required format, including maintaining leading zeros for single-digit hours.

Correctness: **True**
