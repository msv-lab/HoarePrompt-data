### Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements.

The program is structured to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it prints a specific set of points based on the value of \(n\).

1. **Base Cases:**
    - For \(n = 2\), the points printed are \((1,1)\) and \((1,2)\). The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is optimal for \(n = 2\).
    - For \(n = 3\), the points printed are \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), and \((2,3)\). The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is optimal for \(n = 3\).

2. **General Case for \(n \geq 4\):**
    - The program prints the points \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), \((2,4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
    - For \(n = 4\), the points printed are \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), \((2,4)\), \((4,4)\). The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which is not optimal. An optimal arrangement for \(n = 4\) would yield more distinct distances.
    - For \(n = 5\), the points printed are \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), \((2,4)\), \((4,4)\), \((5,5)\). The set of Manhattan distances is not optimal.
    - For \(n = 6\), the points printed are \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), \((2,4)\), \((4,4)\), \((5,5)\), \((6,6)\). The set of Manhattan distances is not optimal.

The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The strategy used in the provided program does not achieve this for \(n \geq 4\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
