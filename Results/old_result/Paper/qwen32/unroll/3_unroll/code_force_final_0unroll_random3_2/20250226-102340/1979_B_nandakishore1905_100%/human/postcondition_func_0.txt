The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` and then determines the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `k` if `k` is not already a power of 2. If `k` is odd, it outputs `1`. Otherwise, it outputs the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
