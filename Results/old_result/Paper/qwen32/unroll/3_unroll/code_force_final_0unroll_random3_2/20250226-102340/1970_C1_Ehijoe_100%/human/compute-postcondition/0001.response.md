The provided code snippet initializes an empty list called `edges`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, or `u_1`. The only change is that the `edges` list is now initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the single round of the game. `edges` is an empty list.**
