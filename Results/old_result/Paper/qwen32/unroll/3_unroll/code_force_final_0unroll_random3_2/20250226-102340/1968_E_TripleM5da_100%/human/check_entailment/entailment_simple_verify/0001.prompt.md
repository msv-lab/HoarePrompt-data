You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.

    #State: For each of the t test cases, the output consists of the lines: 1 1, 1 2, and then for each i from 3 to n, the line i i. The value of t and the values of n for each test case remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

The program is supposed to output a set of n points on an n x n grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. It then prints the point (1, 1).
4. It prints the point (1, 2).
5. For the remaining points (from 3 to n), it prints points of the form (i, i).

Let's analyze the output for different values of `n`:

- For `n=2`, the output is:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  ```
  The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1
  - Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0
  - Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0
  The distinct Manhattan distances are {0, 1}, which is correct for `n=2`.

- For `n=3`, the output is:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  ```
  The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1
  - Between (1,1) and (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 4
  - Between (1,2) and (3,3): |1-3| + |2-3| = 3
  - Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0
  - Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0
  - Between (3,3) and (3,3): 0
  The distinct Manhattan distances are {0, 1, 3, 4}, which is not optimal. For `n=3`, the optimal solution should give us the distinct distances {0, 1, 2, 3}.

- For `n=4`, the output is:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  ```
  The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1
  - Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4
  - Between (1,1) and (4,4): 6
  - Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3
  - Between (1,2) and (4,4): 5
  - Between (3,3) and (4,4): 2
  - Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0
  - Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0
  - Between (3,3) and (3,3): 0
  - Between (4,4) and (4,4): 0
  The distinct Manhattan distances are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which is correct for `n=4`.

However, for `n=3`, the program does not produce the optimal solution.

Given the above analysis, the program does not always produce the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
