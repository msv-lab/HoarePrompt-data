To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given code snippet. The code processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it performs a series of checks and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions provided.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If `x < k - 1`:
   - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

2. If `x == k - 1`:
   - It checks if `a >= x + 2`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. If `x > k - 1`:
   - It initializes `z` to `k - 2` and then iterates `x - k + 3` times. In each iteration, it updates `z` using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, one for each test case.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all iterations, the output state can be described as a list of 'YES' or 'NO' responses corresponding to each test case. However, since the exact test cases are not provided, we can only describe the format and nature of the output state.

Output State: **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, one for each test case.**
