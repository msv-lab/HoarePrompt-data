You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and an integer `m`. For each test case, it constructs a new integer by reversing some of the integers in the list according to specific rules and then compares this constructed integer to `10^m`. It prints 'Sasha' if the constructed integer is greater than `10^m` and 'Anna' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- **Players**: Anna and Sasha.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Anna reverses the digits of a number in her turn.
  - Sasha concatenates two numbers in his turn.
- **Winning Condition**:
  - Sasha wins if the final number is not less than 10^m.
  - Anna wins otherwise.
- **Objective**: Determine the winner if both play optimally.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of integers) and `m` (power of 10).
   - It then reads the list of integers.

2. **Processing Anna's Moves**:
   - The program reverses each number in the list and stores the reversed numbers in `rev_val`.
   - It also constructs a string `rev_res` by concatenating numbers that do not change length upon reversal.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation**:
   - The program sorts the `rev_val` list.
   - It then alternates concatenating reversed numbers and their original forms (reversed again) into `rev_res`.

4. **Determine Winner**:
   - The program checks if the final concatenated number `rev_res` is greater than or equal to 10^m.
   - If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Anna's Moves**:
   - The program reverses all numbers and sorts them, but it does not consider the optimal strategy for Anna.
   - Anna should choose to reverse numbers in a way that minimizes the final concatenated number, not just reverse all and sort.

2. **Incorrect Concatenation Strategy**:
   - The program concatenates numbers in a specific order after sorting, but it does not consider the optimal strategy for Sasha.
   - Sasha should concatenate numbers in a way that maximizes the final number, not just alternate between reversed and non-reversed forms.

3. **Assumption of Winning Condition**:
   - The program assumes that sorting and concatenating in a specific order will determine the winner, which is incorrect.
   - The optimal strategy for both players is not correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players and does not determine the winner correctly based on the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
