The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now contain `n` integers as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; The list `a` contains `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise distinct; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The list `a` is now populated with `n` integers from the input.**
