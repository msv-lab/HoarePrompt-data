Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it calculates and prints either `-1` if certain conditions are not met, or a computed value `k` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `k` is determined by adding `a` to the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3, and possibly adding an additional 1 if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3.**
