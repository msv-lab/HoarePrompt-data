Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines and prints a specific integer value based on the frequency of elements in the list `a`. The printed value represents the smallest index `j` such that the number of elements in `a` that are less than 2 is exhausted, starting from index 1, or 0 if the first element (index 0) does not appear in the list.**
