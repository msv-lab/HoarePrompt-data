### Reasoning:

The provided program is tasked with determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. The program's logic is based on the observation that if all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements because any subarray will still be beautiful. If not all elements are the same, the goal is to find the smallest contiguous subarray that contains the most frequent element, as removing this subarray can potentially break the "beautiful" property.

However, the program's logic does not correctly address the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Find Minimum Deletions**:
   - The program calculates the length of the longest contiguous subarray of the most frequent element. It then prints this length as the answer, which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach should be to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be transformed into a single value by using the given operation. The minimum number of deletions would then be the total number of elements minus the length of this sequence.

2. **Handling Multiple Elements**:
   - The program only checks the first element (`tmp = a[0]`) and counts its consecutive appearances. This approach does not consider other elements that might form longer contiguous subsequences.
   - A more robust approach would involve checking all elements and their contiguous subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly identifies when all elements are the same and outputs `-1`.
   - However, it fails to correctly compute the minimum deletions for arrays with more than one unique element.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
