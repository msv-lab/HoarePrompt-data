The provided code snippet `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` assigns the string containing all lowercase Latin letters to the variable `a`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The initial state specifies conditions on `t`, `n`, and the list `a`, but the list `a` is being reassigned in the code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z that corresponds to the given trace a.**
