In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `i` and the value obtained from `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is expected to be the number of iterations `n` for each test case.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the value obtained from `int(input())`.
2. **Dependencies**: The loop will execute if the value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 0. This value is `n`, the number of iterations for each test case.
3. **Adjustments**: Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that will allow the loop to execute. Since `n` is the number of iterations and it is given that `2 <= n <= 10^3` for each test case, `int(input())` should return a value within this range.

Given that `t` is the number of test cases and for each test case, `n` is the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a valid `n` for each test case.

**State Adjustment**: Before the loop starts, `int(input())` should return a value `n` such that `2 <= n <= 10^3`. The variable `i` is initialized within the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, `int(input())` must return `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**
