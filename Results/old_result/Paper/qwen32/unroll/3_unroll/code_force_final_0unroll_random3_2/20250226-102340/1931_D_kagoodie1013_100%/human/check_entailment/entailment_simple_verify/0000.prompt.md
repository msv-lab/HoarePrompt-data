You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` as per the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Logic for Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store the counts of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` such that `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it increments the count by the number of times this pair has been seen before.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The key insight is that for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful, `a_i + a_j` must be divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` must be divisible by `y`.
   - This can be mathematically represented as:
     - `a_i + a_j ≡ 0 (mod x)` which simplifies to `a_i ≡ -a_j (mod x)`.
     - `a_i - a_j ≡ 0 (mod y)` which simplifies to `a_i ≡ a_j (mod y)`.
   - Therefore, for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful, the residues `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` must match the residues `(-a_j % x, a_j % y)`.
   - The program correctly implements this logic by keeping track of the counts of these residues and checking for matches as it iterates through the array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `x` and `y` are equal.
   - It also handles cases where the array contains duplicate elements.
   - The program processes up to `2 * 10^5` elements efficiently using a dictionary to store and look up residue pairs.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
