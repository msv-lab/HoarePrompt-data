t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and for each test case, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
