To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i * i <= nn`. Here, `i` and `nn` are the variables in the loop head.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `factors` is an empty dictionary.
- `nn` is a positive integer greater than 1 equal to `n`.
- `i` is 2.

The loop condition `i * i <= nn` must be true for the loop to execute. Given that `i` is 2, we need to ensure that `2 * 2 <= nn`, or `4 <= nn`.

Since `nn` is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nn` must be at least 4 for the condition to be true.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `nn` (and hence `n`) is at least 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4; `factors` is an empty dictionary; `nn` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 equal to `n`; `i` is 2**.
