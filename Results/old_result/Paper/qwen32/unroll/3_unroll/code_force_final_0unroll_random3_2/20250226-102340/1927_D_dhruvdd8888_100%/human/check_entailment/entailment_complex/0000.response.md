### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by processing each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the array and the queries, then it tries to find a pair of indices (i, j) within the range [l, r] such that the elements at these indices are different. 

The approach taken by the program is to first segment the input array `nums` into contiguous blocks of identical elements. It then processes each query by finding the segment that starts within the range [l, r]. The logic for determining the output for each query is as follows:

- If the segment starts after `l`, it checks whether there is a preceding segment that ends before `l` or if the segment starts after `r`. If either condition is true, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no such pair exists. Otherwise, it prints the last element of the previous segment and the first element of the current segment.
- If the segment ends at or after `r`, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no such pair exists.
- Otherwise, it prints the first element of the current segment and the first element of the next segment.

However, there are several issues with this approach:
1. The program does not correctly handle the case where the segment that starts within the range [l, r] is the only segment in that range. In such cases, it should check if there are other segments outside this range that can form a valid pair.
2. The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple segments within the range [l, r]. It only checks the first segment that starts within the range and does not consider subsequent segments.
3. The program incorrectly assumes that the segment that starts within the range [l, r] is the only segment that needs to be considered, which is not always the case.

Given the annotated state of the program and the logic described, it is clear that the program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios and edge cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
