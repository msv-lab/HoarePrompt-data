Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers reflecting 'F' relationships, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers reflecting 'S' relationships, `xx` is a list of `n + 1` strings where each '?' in the strings from index 1 to `n` is replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions in the loop, `sa` is a list of indices where there is a 'F' relationship but no 'S' relationship, plus any additional indices where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `sb` is a list of indices where there is an 'S' relationship but no 'F' relationship. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `t` is the length of `sa` before the loop started. Otherwise, `xx` is a list of `n + 1` strings where the first string is an empty string and the remaining `n` strings have each '?' replaced by 'S' if the corresponding index conditions are met, otherwise by 'F', and the `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` lists remain unchanged.**
