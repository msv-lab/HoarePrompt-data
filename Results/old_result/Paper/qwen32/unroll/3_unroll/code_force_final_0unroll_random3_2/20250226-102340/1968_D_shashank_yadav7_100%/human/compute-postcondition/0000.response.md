Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each element p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints for the other variables remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.
