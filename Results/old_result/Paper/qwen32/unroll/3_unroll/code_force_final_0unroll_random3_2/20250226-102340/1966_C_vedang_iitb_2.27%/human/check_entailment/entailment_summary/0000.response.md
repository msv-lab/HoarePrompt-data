### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given functions and their role in solving the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function appears to be transforming the input list `a` which contains the number of stones in each pile.
- **Transformation**: It first creates a sorted list of unique elements from `a` (i.e., `a_new`), then modifies `a_new` such that each element (except the first one) is the difference between itself and the previous element in the sorted unique list (`a_temp`).
- **Output**: The function returns a list of integers, which is essentially the differences between consecutive unique and sorted values from the input list.
- **Issue**: The transformation performed by `func_1` does not seem to align with the rules of the game or any known optimal strategy for determining the winner. For instance, the game essentially revolves around the parity (odd/even) of the number of piles with an odd number of stones, and the transformation does not reflect this.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to determine the winner of the game based on the transformed list `a` and the number of piles `n`.
- **Logic**:
  - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), the first player (Alice) wins.
  - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the first player wins if the number of stones in the first pile is even; otherwise, the second player wins.
  - For more than two piles, the function recursively determines the winner of the game with one less pile (`a[1:]`), and then decides based on the result and the value of the first pile.
- **Issue**: The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for determining the winner. The game is essentially a variant of Nim, and the correct approach involves checking the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. The current logic does not account for this.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the winner of the game. The transformation in `func_1` is not relevant to the game rules, and the logic in `func_2` does not correctly apply the optimal strategy for the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
