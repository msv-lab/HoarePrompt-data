Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires us to determine the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received, the described settling pattern is valid.

The settling pattern is cyclic and has a length of `2k - 2`. Within each cycle:
- The first `k` positions are numbered `1, 2, ..., k`.
- The next `k-2` positions are numbered `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.

For a given `n` and `x`, we need to find all `k` such that the position `n` in the line corresponds to the number `x` in the settling pattern.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cycle Length**: The cycle length is `2k - 2`. Therefore, the position `n` can be mapped to a position within the cycle by taking `n % (2k - 2)`.
2. **Position Mapping**: Within a cycle, the position `n % (2k - 2)` should map to `x`. This can happen in two scenarios:
   - `n % (2k - 2) <= k` and `n % (2k - 2) == x`
   - `n % (2k - 2) > k` and `n % (2k - 2) == 2k - x`
3. **Constraints**: `x` must be in the range `[1, k]` and `k > 1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Calculating `y = n + x` and checking if `y` is even. If not, it prints `0` because the cycle length `2k - 2` must be even.
2. Using a helper function `func_1` to find possible values of `k` based on the given `n` and `x`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the possible values of `k` based on the position `n` and the number `x`. It uses an incorrect formula and logic.
2. **Helper Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of a number but does not correctly map these divisors to valid `k` values.
3. **Logic for Valid `k`**: The program does not properly implement the logic to check if a calculated `k` is valid given `n` and `x`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the program, it does not correctly determine the number of possible values of `k` for each test case.

**Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid `k` values based on the given `n` and `x`. A correct implementation would involve checking the position within the cycle and ensuring that `k` satisfies the conditions described in the problem statement.
