You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `t` remains the same integer; `n` and `q` remain the same integers; `c` remains the same list of integers; `a` remains the same list of integers; `b` is a list where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[i] > 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1] (where each a[i] is the cumulative sum of the elements up to the i-th index in the list c)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` remains the same integer; `n` and `q` remain the same integers; `c` remains the same list of integers; `a` is still a list of integers where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index in the original list; `b` is still a list where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[i] > 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no direct parameters but operates based on predefined inputs. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function returns the sum of the integers in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` inclusive.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
