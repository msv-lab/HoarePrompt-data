Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Let's analyze the logic of the code and compare it with the problem description.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`) such that `a[i - 1] = a[i + 1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i - 1]`.

The provided code attempts to solve this by counting consecutive elements that are the same and then finding the minimum count of such elements. However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
7
1 2 1 2 1 2 1
```
The correct answer should be `1` because we can remove any one of the `2`s to make the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` or `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, which are not beautiful.

However, the provided code will output `2` for this case. Here's why:
- The code counts consecutive `1`s and `2`s and finds the minimum count of consecutive elements, which is `1` for both `1`s and `2`s.
- But since the array is alternating and removing one `2` will not make it stop being beautiful, the code incorrectly outputs `2`.

### Another Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
The correct answer should be `2` because we can remove the `2`s to make the array `[1, 3, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

However, the provided code will output `1` for this case. Here's why:
- The code counts consecutive `1`s and `2`s and `3`s, and finds the minimum count of consecutive elements, which is `1` for all elements.
- But since the array is not alternating in a way that can be made uniform by removing just one element, the code incorrectly outputs `1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements and fails for certain edge cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
