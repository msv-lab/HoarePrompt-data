Let's analyze the given loop and the initial state to understand the output state.

The initial state describes that there is an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` such that `2 <= n <= 10^3`.

The loop structure is as follows:
1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the value of `n` is read.
3. The first two lines printed are always `1 1` and `1 2`.
4. The inner loop runs from `3` to `n` (inclusive), and for each iteration, it prints `i i`.

Given this loop structure, the output for each test case will be:
- `1 1`
- `1 2`
- Followed by lines of the form `i i` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n`.

Let's summarize the output state in the required format.

Output State: **For each of the t test cases, the output consists of the lines: 1 1, 1 2, and then for each i from 3 to n, the line i i. The value of t and the values of n for each test case remain unchanged.**
