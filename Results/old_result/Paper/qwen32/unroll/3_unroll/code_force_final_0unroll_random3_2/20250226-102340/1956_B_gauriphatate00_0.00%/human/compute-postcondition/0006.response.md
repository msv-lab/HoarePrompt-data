The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, and `results`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself, only the loop body.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The value of `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards you and Nene each receive, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace, `idx` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
