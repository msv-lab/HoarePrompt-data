The only variable in the loop head is `c` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `cases` is an input integer, and it needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute.

State: **`cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0**
