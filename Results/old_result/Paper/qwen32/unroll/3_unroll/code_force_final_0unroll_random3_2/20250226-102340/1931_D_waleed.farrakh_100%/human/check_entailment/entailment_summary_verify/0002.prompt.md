You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, two favorite integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. The function collects these test cases, passes them to `func_1` for processing, and outputs the results returned by `func_1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to ensure correctness.

**Problem Analysis:**
- We are given an array `a` and two integers `x` and `y`.
- A pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if:
  - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
  - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

**Approach:**
- For each element `a_i` in the array, we need to check how many subsequent elements `a_j` (where `j > i`) form a beautiful pair with `a_i`.
- To efficiently count these pairs, the program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx = (-a_i % x + x) % x` and `ry = a_i % y`.
- For each element `a_i`, the program calculates `rx` and `ry` and checks if `(rx, ry)` has been seen before. If it has, it means there are previous elements that can form a beautiful pair with `a_i`.
- The program updates the frequency of the current pair `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` in the dictionary.

**Key Points:**
- The calculation of `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative and within the range `[0, x-1]`. This is done to handle negative remainders correctly.
- The program uses a single pass through the array for each test case, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case.

**Verification:**
- The sample input-output pairs provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
- The logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound, as it correctly checks the conditions for each pair `(i, j)` using the precomputed remainders.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.
