### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m` and adds them together without considering the overlaps in visibility periods between fireworks launched by the two installations. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that fireworks from both installations may be visible simultaneously for certain durations.

To illustrate the issue, let's revisit the third example provided in the problem description:

- For the input `7 8 56`, the program calculates `A` as `int(56 / 7) + 1 = 9` and `B` as `int(56 / 8) + 1 = 8`, and then prints `A + B = 17`.

However, the problem description provides a detailed explanation that at minute 56, both installations launch fireworks, and these fireworks are visible from minute 56 to 112, inclusive. Therefore, at minute 56, 17 fireworks are visible, but at other times, the number of visible fireworks will be less due to the overlaps.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Fireworks from the first installation:**
   - Launched at times: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112
   - Visible times: [7-11], [14-20], [21-27], [28-34], [35-41], [42-48], [49-55], [56-112], [63-69], [70-76], [77-83], [84-90], [91-97], [98-104], [105-111], [112-112]

2. **Fireworks from the second installation:**
   - Launched at times: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112
   - Visible times: [8-15], [16-23], [24-31], [32-39], [40-47], [48-55], [56-112], [64-71], [72-79], [80-87], [88-95], [96-103], [104-111], [112-112]

At minute 56, both installations launch fireworks, and these fireworks are visible from minute 56 to 112, inclusive. Therefore, at minute 56, 17 fireworks are visible. At other times, the number of visible fireworks will be less due to the overlaps.

Thus, the program's approach of simply adding the counts of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m` is incorrect because it does not account for these overlaps.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
