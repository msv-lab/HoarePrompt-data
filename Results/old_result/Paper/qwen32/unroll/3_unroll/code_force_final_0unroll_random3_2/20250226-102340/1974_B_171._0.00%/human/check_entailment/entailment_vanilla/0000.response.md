Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to decode a given string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` consisting of unique characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to decode the encoded string by maintaining a mapping of characters from the encoded string to the original characters. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the encoded string.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the mapping from characters in the encoded string to characters in the original string.
   - It initializes an empty list `decoded` to build the decoded string.
   - For each character in the encoded string:
     - If the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary, it appends the corresponding original character to the `decoded` list.
     - If the character is not in the `mapping` dictionary, it finds the next available character (from 'a' to 'z') that is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary and adds this character as a key with the current encoded character as its value. Then, it appends this character to the `decoded` list.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded string is constructed by joining the characters in the `decoded` list and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. It tries to map each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z', which is not the correct approach.
- The program does not construct the auxiliary string `r` and use it to find the symmetric characters for decoding.
- The approach of finding the next available character from 'a' to 'z' is flawed because it does not respect the order and symmetry required by the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string, the program should:
1. Identify the unique characters in the encoded string and sort them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly decode the encoded string as per the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
