t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, a list a of length n with integers such that 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, and a list b of length n with integers such that 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9.
