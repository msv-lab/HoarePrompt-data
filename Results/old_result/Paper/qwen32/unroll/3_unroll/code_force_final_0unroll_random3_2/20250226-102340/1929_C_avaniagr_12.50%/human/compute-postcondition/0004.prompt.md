You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function receives three integers k (2 ≤ k ≤ 30), x (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9) representing the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins Sasha has, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: A sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' printed lines, one for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 30), `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and `a` (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9), representing the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins Sasha has, respectively. The function returns the maximum number of coins Sasha can have after playing the game according to the rules defined by `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
