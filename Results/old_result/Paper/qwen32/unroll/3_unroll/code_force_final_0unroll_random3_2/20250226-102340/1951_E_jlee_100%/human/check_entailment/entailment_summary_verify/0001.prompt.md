You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it can be split into one or two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string do not appear in the same substring, or if the string is a palindrome with specific conditions. It outputs "YES" followed by the number of splits and the splits themselves if possible, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given problem requires partitioning a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking various conditions and constructing partitions as needed.

Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Single Character Strings**: If the string has only one character, it is trivially a palindrome, so the program correctly outputs "NO".

2. **First and Last Characters Different**: If the first and last characters of the string are different, the entire string is non-palindromic, so the program outputs "YES" with the entire string as the single partition.

3. **All Characters Same**: If all characters in the string are the same, any substring will also be a palindrome, so the program correctly outputs "NO".

4. **All but One Character Same**: If all but one character are the same, and the string has an odd length with the differing character in the middle, the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, so the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES" with the entire string as the single partition.

5. **General Case**: For more complex strings, the program checks for the first position where the string is not symmetric. If such a position is found, it considers the string non-palindromic and outputs "YES" with the entire string as the single partition. If no such position is found, it further checks for positions where the string can be split into two non-palindromic substrings. If such a split is found, it outputs "YES" with the two substrings.

6. **No Valid Partition**: If the program exhausts all checks and finds no valid partition, it outputs "NO".

### Issues in the Program:

The program has several logical flaws and edge cases it does not handle correctly:

- **Incorrect Handling of Palindromic Strings**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the string is palindromic but can be split into non-palindromic substrings. For example, the string "ababa" is palindromic, but it can be split into "ab" and "aba", but the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for such cases.
  
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The logic for splitting the string into two non-palindromic substrings is flawed. The program does not correctly identify valid splits, especially in cases where the string can be split into more than two substrings.

- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly, such as strings with repeating patterns that can be split into non-palindromic substrings.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct for all possible inputs. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
