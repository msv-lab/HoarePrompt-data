You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, n is the number of people in the queue excluding Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill in the queue. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are the costs Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are the additional costs Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th person during a swap (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        
        best = sys.float_info.max
        
        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: After processing all test cases, the program will have printed the minimum total cost for Kirill to reach his desired position or better for each test case. The variables `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best` will reflect the state of the last processed test case. Specifically, `cases` will remain unchanged, `na_frente` and `pos_final` will hold the values of the last test case, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` will hold the cost lists of the last test case, `total` will be the total cost accumulated during the processing of the last test case, and `best` will be the minimum cost found for Kirill to reach his desired position or better in the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people `n` in the queue (excluding Kirill), the maximum allowable final position `m` of Kirill in the queue, the list `a` of costs Kirill has to pay to swap places with each person, and the list `b` of additional costs Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th person during a swap. For each test case, the function returns the minimum total cost for Kirill to reach a position no greater than `m` in the queue.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
