To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic used in the program to decide whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given conditions.

### Key Conditions and Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Sasha has `a` coins.
   - He can win and lose according to the rules of the casino.
   - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

2. **Winning and Losing Rules:**
   - If Sasha wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
   - If Sasha loses, his coins decrease by `y`.
   - The bet amount `y` is a positive integer and cannot exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

3. **Promotion Rule:**
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

### Strategy Analysis:
- **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
  - If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he will have lost `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + x` coins, which is `x * (x + 1) / 2`.
  - He needs at least `x + 1` coins to ensure he can always place the next bet after `x` consecutive losses.
  - The program checks if `a >= x + 1`.

- **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
  - If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he will have lost `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + x` coins.
  - He needs at least `x + 3` coins to ensure he can always place the next bet after `x` consecutive losses.
  - The program checks if `a >= x + 3`.

- **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
  - The program calculates the minimum number of coins `z` required to ensure Sasha can always place the next bet after `x` consecutive losses.
  - The calculation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is repeated `x + 1` times.
  - The program checks if `a >= z`.

### Program Logic:
The program correctly handles the three cases based on the relationship between `x` and `k - 1`. It calculates the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can always place the next bet after `x` consecutive losses and checks if Sasha's initial number of coins `a` is sufficient.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic aligns with the problem description and correctly determines whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
