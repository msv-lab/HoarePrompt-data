The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of an array `a` that is not yet defined in the given initial state. The value of `n` is specifically assigned based on the input.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`. The second line contains `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer.**
