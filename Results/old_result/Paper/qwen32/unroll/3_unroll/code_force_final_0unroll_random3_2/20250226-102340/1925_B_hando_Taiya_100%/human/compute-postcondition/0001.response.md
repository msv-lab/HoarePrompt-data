The code snippet provided initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, or `n` from the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `ans` with a value of 0.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; For each of the t test cases, x and n are integers read from the input such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x; ans is 0.**
