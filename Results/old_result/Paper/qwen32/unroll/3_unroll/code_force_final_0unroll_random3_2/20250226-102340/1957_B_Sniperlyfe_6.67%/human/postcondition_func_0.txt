The function takes two parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of `n` elements, where each element except the last one is the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, and the last element is this largest number plus the remaining value of `k` after distributing the largest numbers to the first `n-1` elements.
