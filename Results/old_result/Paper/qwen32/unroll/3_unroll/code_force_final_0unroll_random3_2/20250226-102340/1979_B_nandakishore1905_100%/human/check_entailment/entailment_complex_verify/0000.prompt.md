You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: A series of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is determined by the logic described above for the corresponding pair of integers (n, m).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` and then determines the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `k` if `k` is not already a power of 2. If `k` is odd, it outputs `1`. Otherwise, it outputs the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description and the given solution.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).
- We need to consider two infinite sequences \( a_n = n \oplus x \) and \( b_n = n \oplus y \), where \( \oplus \) denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
- The task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of these two sequences. A subsegment is a contiguous part of a sequence.

### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**: The XOR operation has several useful properties, especially in relation to sequences. For example, \( a_n = n \oplus x \) means each element \( a_n \) is the result of XORing \( n \) with \( x \).
2. **Common Subsegment**: We need to find the longest contiguous subsequence that appears in both sequences \( a \) and \( b \).

### Given Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using the following logic:
- Compute \( k = |x - y| \).
- If \( k \) is a power of 2 (i.e., \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \)), then print \( k \).
- If \( k \) is odd, print 1.
- Otherwise, compute the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) and print that value.

### Validation Against Problem Description:
Let's consider the provided examples and see if the solution works correctly for them:

1. **Example 1**: \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \)
   - \( k = |0 - 1| = 1 \)
   - Since \( k \) is odd, the solution prints 1, which matches the expected output.

2. **Example 2**: \( x = 12 \), \( y = 4 \)
   - \( k = |12 - 4| = 8 \)
   - Since \( k \) is a power of 2, the solution prints 8, which matches the expected output.

3. **Example 3**: \( x = 57 \), \( y = 37 \)
   - \( k = |57 - 37| = 20 \)
   - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 20 is 16. However, the solution prints 4, which matches the expected output. This suggests that the solution might be correctly identifying the largest power of 2 for this case.

4. **Example 4**: \( x = 316560849 \), \( y = 14570961 \)
   - \( k = |316560849 - 14570961| = 301989888 \)
   - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 301989888 is 268435456, which is \( 2^{28} \). The solution prints 33554432, which is \( 2^{25} \), and this matches the expected output.

### Potential Edge Cases:
To ensure correctness, let's consider some edge cases:
- \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \): Already tested and works.
- \( x = 0 \), \( y = 2 \): \( k = 2 \), which is a power of 2, and the solution should print 2.
- \( x = 0 \), \( y = 3 \): \( k = 3 \), which is odd, and the solution should print 1.
- \( x = 0 \), \( y = 4 \): \( k = 4 \), which is a power of 2, and the solution should print 4.
- \( x = 0 \), \( y = 5 \): \( k = 5 \), which is odd, and the solution should print 1.
- \( x = 0 \), \( y = 6 \): \( k = 6 \), the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 6 is 4, and the solution should print 4.
- \( x = 0 \), \( y = 7 \): \( k = 7 \), which is odd, and the solution should print 1.
- \( x = 0 \), \( y = 8 \): \( k = 8 \), which is a power of 2, and the solution should print 8.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing of various cases, the provided solution correctly computes the length of the longest common subsegment for the given examples and edge cases. The logic used in the solution appears to be sound and handles the problem requirements accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
