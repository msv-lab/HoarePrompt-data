In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `t > 0`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, the variable `t` must be greater than 0. 

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

This state already satisfies the condition `t > 0` because `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
