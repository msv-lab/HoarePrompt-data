Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in how it calculates the minimum number of operations.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program reads the input as a string and then searches for the first and last occurrence of '1'. This part is correct.
2. However, the program then slices the array from the first '1' to the last '1' and counts the number of '0's in this slice. This count does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations required.
3. The correct approach involves calculating the cost of moving each chip to the leftmost possible position in the contiguous block of chips.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input('').split()))
        cost = 0
        leftmost = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                cost += i - leftmost
                leftmost += 1
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the cost of moving each chip to the leftmost position in the contiguous block of chips, which is the minimum number of operations required.
