Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input. If `n` is equal to 2, the specific conditions on `p` and `v` remain as described in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions on `p` and `v` remain as described in the else part.**
