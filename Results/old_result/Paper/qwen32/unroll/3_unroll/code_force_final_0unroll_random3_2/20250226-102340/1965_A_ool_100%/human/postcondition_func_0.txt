The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the first integer `n` represents the number of piles, and the following `n` integers represent the number of stones in each pile. The function determines the winner of a game based on the unique stone counts across all test cases. If the smallest unique stone count is not 1, or if there are any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive unique stone counts, the function returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it returns 'Alice' if the number of unique stone counts minus one is even, and 'Bob' if it is odd.
