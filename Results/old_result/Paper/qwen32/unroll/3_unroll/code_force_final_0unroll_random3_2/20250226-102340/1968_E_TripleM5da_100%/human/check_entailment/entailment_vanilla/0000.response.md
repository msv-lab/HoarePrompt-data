Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to select `n` cells in an `n x n` grid to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of selected cells.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and prints the following points:
1. The point `(1, 1)`
2. The point `(1, 2)`
3. For every `i` from 3 to `n`, it prints the point `(i, i)`

### Points Selected:
For `n = 3`, the points selected are:
- `(1, 1)`
- `(1, 2)`
- `(3, 3)`

For `n = 4`, the points selected are:
- `(1, 1)`
- `(1, 2)`
- `(3, 3)`
- `(4, 4)`

### Manhattan Distances Calculation:
Let's calculate the Manhattan distances for `n = 3`:
- Distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` is `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
- Distance between `(1, 1)` and `(3, 3)` is `|1-3| + |1-3| = 4`
- Distance between `(1, 2)` and `(3, 3)` is `|1-3| + |2-3| = 3`

So, the set of distinct Manhattan distances is `{1, 3, 4}`.

For `n = 4`:
- Distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` is `1`
- Distance between `(1, 1)` and `(3, 3)` is `4`
- Distance between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)` is `6`
- Distance between `(1, 2)` and `(3, 3)` is `3`
- Distance between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)` is `5`
- Distance between `(3, 3)` and `(4, 4)` is `2`

So, the set of distinct Manhattan distances is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`. For example, the program only provides 3 distinct distances for `n = 3` when it is possible to achieve more. For `n = 3`, the optimal solution should provide at least 4 distinct distances.

### Correctness:
Based on the above analysis, the program is not correct for all values of `n`.

**Correctness: False**
