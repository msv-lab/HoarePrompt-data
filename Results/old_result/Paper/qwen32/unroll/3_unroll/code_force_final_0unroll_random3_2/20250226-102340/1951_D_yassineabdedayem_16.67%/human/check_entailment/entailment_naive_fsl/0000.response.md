Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not always produce the correct output based on the problem description. Let's analyze the program and identify potential issues:

1. **Logic for Setting Prices**:
   The logic used in the program to determine the prices for the stalls is flawed. The program attempts to set prices based on the minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k`, which does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The program does not ensure that the sum of the number of jewels bought from each stall equals `k`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   10 3
   ```
   The program might output something like:
   ```
   YES
   1
   10
   ```
   This is incorrect because Alice would only buy 1 jewel at a price of 10 coins, not 3 jewels.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   A correct approach would involve setting up the prices in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible strategy is to set up the stalls with prices such that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall until she has bought exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Example of Correct Output**:
   For the test case `10 3`, a correct output could be:
   ```
   YES
   3
   3 3 4
   ```
   Here, Alice buys 3 jewels at 3 coins each from the first two stalls and 1 jewel at 4 coins from the third stall, totaling 3 jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
