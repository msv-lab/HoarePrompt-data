In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the value `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, and `int(input())` is the number of iterations, which is `t` in this context.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is greater than 0, as the loop will not execute if `t` is 0. The state of `t` is already given as `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`, which ensures that the loop will execute.

The other variables `n` and `a` are mentioned in the problem description but are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted based on the loop head alone. They are used within the loop body, which is omitted in this case.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted (though it already satisfies the condition) is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0. Since the problem states `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`, no further adjustment is necessary.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
