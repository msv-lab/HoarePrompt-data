The provided code snippet only defines a constant `MOD` and does not modify any of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `s`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `MOD` is 1000000006.**
