#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all 1 <= i <= n. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible score for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their paths defined by `p` and values defined by `a`, with up to `k` steps allowed. It then prints the name of the player with the higher score, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.
