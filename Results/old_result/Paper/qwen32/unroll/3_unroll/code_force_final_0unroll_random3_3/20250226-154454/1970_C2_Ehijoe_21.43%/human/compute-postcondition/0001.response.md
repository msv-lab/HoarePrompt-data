Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is 5, `t` is 3, `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes an empty list named `edges`. The values of `nodes`, `start`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
