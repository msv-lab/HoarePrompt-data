### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given array to make it stop being beautiful. The definition of a beautiful array is that you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

The approach taken by the program is to find the smallest contiguous subarray of identical elements. This is based on the idea that removing all but one element from the smallest such subarray will ensure that the array can no longer be made uniform through the described operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `same` to 1, which counts the length of the current contiguous subarray of identical elements. `num` is set to the first element of the array. `minn` is set to infinity, which will store the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of identical elements.
2. **Iteration**: The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
3. **Final Update**: After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last subarray.
4. **Output**: If `minn` is still infinity (which shouldn't happen given the problem constraints), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

However, the logic has a flaw. The program assumes that removing all but one element from the smallest contiguous subarray of identical elements will make the array non-beautiful. This is not necessarily true. The array can still be beautiful if the smallest subarray is part of a larger pattern that can still be reduced to a single element through the described operation.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The smallest subarray of identical elements is `[1]` or `[2]`, but removing any of these does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining array `[2, 1, 2, 1]` or `[1, 2, 1, 2]` can still be reduced to a single element through the operation.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the correctness is:

**Correctness: False**
