Functionality: **The function determines and prints two indices `i` and `j` for each test case such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized among all pairs `(0 â‰¤ i, j < n)` for a given permutation `p` of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. It achieves this by interactively querying up to `3n` times per test case, comparing specific pairs of indices based on bitwise OR operations.**
