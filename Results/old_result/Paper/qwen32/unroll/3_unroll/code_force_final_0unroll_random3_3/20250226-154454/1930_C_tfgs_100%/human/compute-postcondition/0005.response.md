The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `counter`. The initial state of `n` being an integer within a specific range, `a` being a list of `n` integers where each element is modified by adding its index plus one, and `counter` being a Counter object that stores the frequency of each element in the modified list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is the original `a_i` plus `i + 1`; `counter` is a Counter object that stores the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`; `cur` is 0.**
