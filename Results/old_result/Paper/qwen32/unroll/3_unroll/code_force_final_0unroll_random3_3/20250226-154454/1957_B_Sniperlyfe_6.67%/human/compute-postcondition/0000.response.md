Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Natural Language: The variable `nums` has been initialized to a list containing `n` zeros. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) retain their initial values and constraints.
