### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze the program and provide a counterexample to support this.

#### Program Analysis:
The program outputs the following points for each \(n\):
- For \(n = 2\): (1, 1), (1, 2)
- For \(n = 3\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
- For \(n = 4\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
- For \(n = 5\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
- For \(n = 6\): (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)

#### Counterexample for \(n = 3\):
- Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
- Distances:
  - Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\)

The optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should be:
- Points: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)
- Distances:
  - Between (2, 1) and (2, 3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Between (2, 1) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
  - Between (2, 3) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
- Set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)

#### General Analysis:
The program consistently outputs points along the diagonal starting from (1, 1) and (1, 2), which does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances. For larger values of \(n\), the program continues to place points on the diagonal, which limits the variety of Manhattan distances that can be achieved.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
