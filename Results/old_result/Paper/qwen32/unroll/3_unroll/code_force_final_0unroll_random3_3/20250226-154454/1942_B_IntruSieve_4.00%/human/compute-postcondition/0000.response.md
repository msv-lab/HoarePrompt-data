The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.**
