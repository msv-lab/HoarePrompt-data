Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word (composed of lowercase Latin letters) that sums up to a given integer `n` when the positions of the letters in the alphabet are summed. For example, "cat" would be encoded as 24 because 'c' is 3, 'a' is 1, and 't' is 20.

### Program Analysis
The provided program takes multiple test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then attempts to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to `n`.

Here are the steps in the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. It then tries to construct a list `arr` of three elements that sum to `n`:
   - It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 26 and appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `n`. This logic is flawed.
   - It then checks if `n` is less than 52 and appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `n`. This logic is also flawed.
   - It appends the remaining value of `n` to `arr`.
4. It sorts the array `arr` to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
5. It converts each element of `arr` to the corresponding letter by adding 96 (which should be 96 but the correct offset is 97 to convert from 1-based to ASCII 'a') and prints the result.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Handling of Values**:
   - The logic for handling values less than or equal to 26 and less than 52 is incorrect. It should always try to minimize the value of the first letter, then the second, and finally the third.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the sum of the first two letters is less than 26.
   
2. **Incorrect ASCII Offset**:
   - The program uses `chr(arr[k] + 96)`, which is incorrect. The ASCII value for 'a' is 97, not 96. It should be `chr(arr[k] + 97)`.

3. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array `arr` after assigning values does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order because it does not consider the constraints of the problem properly.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we should:
1. Start by assigning the smallest possible value to the first letter.
2. Assign the smallest possible value to the second letter.
3. Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
4. Ensure that each letter is between 1 and 26.
5. Convert each value to the corresponding letter using the correct ASCII offset.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
