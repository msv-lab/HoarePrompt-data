You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is given at the beginning of the input.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: t test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers in the list has been printed. The variables `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` no longer hold any specific values as they are reinitialized in each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. The given program, however, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

For example, consider the test case:
```
2
3
1 3 2
3
3 1 2
```
The expected output should be:
```
2
2
```
However, the provided program will output:
```
2
2
```
which is incorrect for the second test case. The correct output for the second test case should be `1` (when the array is sorted as `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]`).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of consecutive differences. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, l))
        print(beauty)
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of consecutive differences, which is the correct approach.
