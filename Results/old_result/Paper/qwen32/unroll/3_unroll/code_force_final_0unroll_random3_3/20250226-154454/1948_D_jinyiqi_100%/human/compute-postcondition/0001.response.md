Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters, where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, and the total length of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000; `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the length of the list `s`. The other variables and their constraints remain unchanged.
