The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value obtained from `int(input())`, which is expected to be the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, the value of `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input will provide a value within this range.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, and the input to the loop will be `t`**
