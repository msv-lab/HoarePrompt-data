You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` where:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

### Provided Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(test_cases)`: This function processes the test cases and calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, parses the test cases, and calls `func_1` to process them.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
The core logic of the program is in `func_1`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Initialization**: A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
2. **Loop through array**: For each element `a` in the array:
   - Calculate `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` which is equivalent to `(x - a % x) % x` to handle negative remainders.
   - Calculate `ry = a % y`.
   - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add the count from `freq` to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - Update the frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

### Verification of Logic:
1. **Handling of Remainders**:
   - `rx` is calculated as `(x - a % x) % x` to ensure it is always non-negative.
   - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
   - When processing each element `a`, it checks how many previous elements have a pair `(rx, ry)` that would make the current element `a` form a beautiful pair with them.

3. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - For a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful, `a_i + a_j` should be divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `y`.
   - This translates to `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0` and `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0`.
   - The program correctly handles this by checking for pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx` is `(x - a_i % x) % x` and `ry` is `a_i % y`.

### Edge Cases Considered:
1. **Negative Remainders**: The program correctly handles negative remainders by adjusting `rx` to be non-negative.
2. **Multiple Occurrences**: The use of a dictionary to track frequencies ensures that multiple occurrences of the same pair are correctly counted.
3. **Large Inputs**: The program efficiently processes up to `2 * 10^5` elements per test case, which is within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and handling of different cases, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

**Correctness: True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and efficiently using a dictionary to track the frequencies of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`. It handles negative remainders, multiple occurrences, and large inputs within the given constraints.
