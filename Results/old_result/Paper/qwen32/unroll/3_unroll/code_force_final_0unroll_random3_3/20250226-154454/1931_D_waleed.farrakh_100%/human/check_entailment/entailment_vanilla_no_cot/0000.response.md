To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding pairs \((i, j)\) in the array such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Given these conditions, we need to find the number of such beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(test_cases)**: This function processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
2. **func_2()**: This function reads input, parses it, and calls **func_1** to get the results.

Let's break down **func_1**:
- It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\).
- It iterates over each element in the array `arr`.
- For each element `a`, it calculates:
  - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This is the equivalent of \((a \% x)\) but adjusted to handle negative values.
  - `ry = a % y`: This is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
- It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`:
  - If it exists, it adds the frequency to the `count` because each element that has the same remainder pair can form a beautiful pair with the current element.
- It then updates the frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

### Correctness Verification:
- The logic to calculate `rx` and `ry` is correct.
- The use of the frequency dictionary to count pairs is efficient.
- The program correctly handles the conditions for beautiful pairs as described in the problem statement.

### Testing with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:
- For the first test case:
  - `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`
  - `arr = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
  - The program correctly identifies the pairs \((1, 5)\) and \((4, 6)\) as beautiful pairs.

The program gives the correct output for the provided example, and the logic seems sound.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
