The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func_3():`. The function is designed to handle a predefined number of test cases, `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since no parameters are explicitly listed, the function likely relies on some external input or predefined data to process these test cases.

Based on the provided output constraints, the function seems to process each test case and returns specific results based on the conditions of each test case. However, since the exact conditions and results are not provided in the output description, we can only describe the general functionality in terms of the number of test cases.

Functionality: **The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and processes a predefined number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). It returns results based on the conditions of each test case.**
