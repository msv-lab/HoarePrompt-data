In the provided loop:

```python
for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the `range(start_index, start_index + i + 1)` is non-empty. This means that `start_index + i + 1` must be greater than `start_index`. Since `i` is a non-negative integer and `i` is not equal to 0, `start_index + i + 1` will always be greater than `start_index`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, which is already given in the initial state.

However, we need to ensure that `j` is properly initialized to `start_index` and will iterate up to `start_index + i`. Given the initial state, we can confirm that `j` will start from `start_index` and go up to `start_index + i`.

Since the only variables in the loop head are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`, and all conditions are already satisfied by the given initial state, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`, decremented by 1; `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The list `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`**
