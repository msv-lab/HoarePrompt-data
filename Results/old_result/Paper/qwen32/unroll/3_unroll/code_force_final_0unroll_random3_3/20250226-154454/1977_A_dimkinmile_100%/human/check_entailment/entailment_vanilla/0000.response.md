Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations
1. **Parity of Moves**: Adding or removing a cube changes the number of cubes by 1, which means each move changes the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes.
    - If we start with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, we will have an even number of cubes.
    - If we start with 0 cubes (even), after an odd number of moves, we will have an odd number of cubes.
2. **Minimum Moves Required**: To have `m` cubes, the number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because you can't remove a cube if there are none, and you need to add cubes to reach `m`.
3. **Parity Condition**: The difference between the number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must be even because the parity of the number of cubes changes with each move.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise, it prints "No".

### Verification of Conditions
1. **Parity Condition**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the parity of the number of cubes changes correctly.
2. **Minimum Moves Condition**: `n - m >= 0` ensures that we don't need more cubes than the number of moves, which is a valid constraint because we can't remove more cubes than we have.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity and minimum moves conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks both the parity condition and the minimum moves condition to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
Correctness: **True**
