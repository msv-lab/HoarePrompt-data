The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts those parts into integers, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, while `x` and `n` are assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8.**
