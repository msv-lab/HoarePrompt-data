Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). The program only handles specific cases for \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\) correctly, but it fails to generalize for larger values of \(n\).

Here are some specific issues with the code:

1. **For \(n = 2\)**: The program outputs the points (1,1) and (1,2), which is correct as it maximizes \(\mathcal{H}\) to {0, 1}.

2. **For \(n = 3\)**: The program outputs the points (1,1), (1,2), and (2,3), which is correct as it maximizes \(\mathcal{H}\) to {0, 1, 2, 3}.

3. **For \(n \geq 4\)**: The program outputs points (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and then (4,4), (5,5), ..., (n,n) for \(n \geq 4\). This does not maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\) because it does not cover all possible distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \(n = 4\):
- The program outputs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)
- The set of Manhattan distances is: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- However, a better arrangement could be: (1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4)
- This arrangement gives the set of Manhattan distances: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, which is larger.

Thus, the program does not handle the cases for \(n \geq 4\) correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
