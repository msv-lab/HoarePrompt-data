You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic and conditions it uses to decide the outcome of the game based on the provided problem description. The game involves Alice and Bob moving their chips on a checkered board with specific movement rules and win/lose conditions.

The program uses several conditions to determine the winner or if the game ends in a draw. Let's break down the key logic:

1. **Immediate Draw Condition**: If Alice is in the last row (`x_a == h`) or Bob is in the first row (`x_b == 1`), the game ends in a draw. This is correctly handled by the condition `if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1`.

2. **Even vs. Odd Row Positions**: The program then checks if both Alice and Bob are in rows with the same parity (both even or both odd) or different parity. This is done using the condition `elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)`.

   - **Same Parity**: If both are in rows with the same parity, the winner depends on their column positions (`clues[3]` and `clues[5]`). If they are in the same column, Bob wins because he can move up directly to Alice's position. If they are not in the same column, the winner depends on the distance to each other and the number of rows they can move. The program uses additional conditions to determine the winner.
   
   - **Different Parity**: If Alice and Bob are in rows with different parity, Alice wins if they are in the same column, and the winner is determined by the distance and number of rows they can move otherwise.

3. **Column Positions**: The program checks the column positions (`clues[3]` and `clues[5]`) to determine the winner:
   - If they are in the same column, the winner is determined by who can reach the other's position first.
   - If they are in different columns, the winner is determined by the relative positions and the number of moves required.

The program uses complex conditions to handle all these cases. However, the provided logic seems overly complicated and includes redundant checks, which might lead to incorrect results in some edge cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner when Alice and Bob are in rows with different parity and different columns is not straightforward and may not cover all edge cases correctly.

To verify the correctness, we would need to test the program against a wide range of test cases, including edge cases, to ensure it produces the correct results. Without a comprehensive test suite, it's challenging to confirm the correctness of the program with absolute certainty.

Given the complexity and the lack of a comprehensive test suite, we cannot definitively say that the program is correct based solely on the provided code.

Correctness: **False**
