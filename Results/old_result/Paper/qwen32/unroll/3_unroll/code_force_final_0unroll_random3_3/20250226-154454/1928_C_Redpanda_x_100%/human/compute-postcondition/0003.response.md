To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `i * i <= nn`. The variables involved in this condition are `i` and `nn`.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `factors` is an empty dictionary.
- `nn` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.

The condition `i * i <= nn` must be true for the loop to execute. Let's analyze the current state:
- `i` is 2.
- `nn` is a positive integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute, `i * i` (which is `2 * 2 = 4`) must be less than or equal to `nn`. Since `nn` is a positive integer greater than 1, the smallest possible value for `nn` that satisfies `4 <= nn` is 4 itself. Therefore, `nn` must be at least 4.

No other state adjustments are necessary because the other variables (`n` and `factors`) do not affect the loop condition.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `factors` is an empty dictionary; `nn` must be at least 4; `i` is 2**
