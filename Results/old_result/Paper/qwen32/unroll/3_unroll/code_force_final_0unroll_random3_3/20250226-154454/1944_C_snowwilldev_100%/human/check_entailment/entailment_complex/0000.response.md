### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` aims to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function and its correctness:

1. **Counting Elements:**
   - The function uses a `defaultdict` named `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - This is an efficient way to keep track of how many times each number appears in the array.

2. **Determine MEX:**
   - The function iterates over the numbers from `0` to `N` (inclusive).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - If the count of the current number `i` is `1`, it increments a counter `t`.
     - If `t` becomes `2` (meaning there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once) or if the count of `i` is `0` (meaning `i` does not appear in the array at all), the function returns `i` as the MEX.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The function correctly identifies the smallest number `i` that either does not appear in the array or appears exactly once and there are already at least two other numbers that each appear exactly once. This ensures that the MEX is maximized by Alice's optimal strategy and minimized by Bob's optimal strategy.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where all numbers are the same, or where all numbers are distinct.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array contains numbers that do not span the full range from `0` to `N-1`.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The reasoning and implementation are sound, and the function will produce the correct output for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
