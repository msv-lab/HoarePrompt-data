### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- There must be exactly `n` special characters in this string, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- If no such string exists, the program should output "NO".
- If such a string exists, the program should output "YES" followed by the string itself.

#### Provided Program Recap:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads `t`, the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`.
- If `n` is odd, it prints "NO".
- If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating '110' `n // 2` times.
- If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by `s`; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Original Assessment Recap:
- The program is incorrect because it generates a string of '1's and '0's instead of uppercase Latin letters.
- When `n` is even, the program outputs a string like "110110" instead of something like "MM" or "AA".

### Analysis:
1. **Odd `n` Case:**
   - The program correctly identifies that an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved with the given constraints and outputs "NO".
   
2. **Even `n` Case:**
   - The program attempts to construct a string with `n` special characters by repeating '110' `n // 2` times.
   - However, the string '110' consists of digits, not uppercase Latin letters, which violates the problem's requirement.
   - The program does correctly ensure that the length of the string is less than 200, but this is not sufficient to make the solution valid given the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem because it generates a string of digits instead of uppercase Latin letters. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
