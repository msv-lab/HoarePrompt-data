Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t representing the starting nodes where the stone is initially put, with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.**

Explanation:
The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. The value of `t` is specifically set to 1. The rest of the initial conditions regarding the tree edges and starting nodes remain unchanged as they have not been processed by the given code snippet.
