The given code snippet only contains a single line that assigns a boolean value to the variable `empty`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, or the starting nodes where the stone is initially put. The only change is that the variable `empty` is set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t representing the starting nodes where the stone is initially put, with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**
