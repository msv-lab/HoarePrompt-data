### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a rectangle of size \( a \times b \) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key observation is that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, it can be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. This is because an even dimension allows for a cut that results in two rectangles that can be combined in different ways to form a new rectangle.

Let's analyze the logic used in the provided program:
- The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
- If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a different rectangle can be formed.
- If the condition is false (i.e., both `a` and `b` are odd), it prints 'No', indicating that no different rectangle can be formed.

The execution summary aligns with this logic, and the provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program:
- For the 1x1 rectangle, both dimensions are odd, so the output is 'No'.
- For the 2x1 rectangle, one dimension is even, so the output is 'No' (as explained in the problem, it results in 1x1 squares which cannot form a different rectangle).
- For the 2x6 rectangle, one dimension is even, so the output is 'Yes'.
- For the 3x2 rectangle, one dimension is even, so the output is 'Yes'.
- For the 2x2 rectangle, one dimension is even, so the output is 'Yes'.
- For the 2x4 rectangle, one dimension is even, so the output is 'Yes'.
- For the 6x3 rectangle, one dimension is even, so the output is 'No' (as explained in the problem, it results in 3x2 rectangles which cannot form a different rectangle).

The logic in the program correctly reflects the conditions under which a different rectangle can be formed, as per the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
