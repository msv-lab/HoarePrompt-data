To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, we need to understand the values of `ans` and `next_max_diff` based on the given initial state.

### Key Points from the Initial State:
- `ans` holds the minimum value of the maximum of the two differences calculated for each `f` in `F` after all iterations of the loop.
- `next_max_diff` is presumably another value calculated in the loop, but its specific value relative to `ans` is not explicitly provided.

### Analysis:
- `ans` is the result of a comparison and minimization process involving the maximum of two differences for each `f` in `F`.
- `next_max_diff` is another difference value, but its exact value in relation to `ans` is not given.

### Conclusion:
The `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`. Given that `ans` is the minimum value of a set of maximum differences, and `next_max_diff` is another maximum difference, the printed value will be the larger of these two values.

### Output:
Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum value of the maximum of the two differences calculated for each f in F, and next_max_diff is another maximum difference value)**
