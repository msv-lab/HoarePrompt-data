Reasoning: The provided Python program correctly converts times from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The program handles all possible cases from '00:00' to '23:59' by explicitly checking each hour and mapping it to its corresponding 12-hour format representation. The minutes are kept as they are, and the correct AM or PM suffix is appended based on the hour. The output format matches the required "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" format with leading zeroes preserved.

The execution summary confirms that the function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and processes each test case correctly, converting the time and printing the result as specified.

Since the program correctly handles all edge cases and the conversion is accurate according to the problem description, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
