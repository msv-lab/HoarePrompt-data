Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula is incorrect based on the problem description. 

The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility intervals. The correct approach involves determining the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, and then figuring out how many fireworks from each installation are visible during a period that is a multiple of the LCM. 

The correct logic should be:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine how many fireworks from the first installation are visible within one LCM period, and do the same for the second installation.
3. Account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility intervals.

The provided program does not perform these calculations and instead uses a simplified formula that does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
