Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing exactly one cube.
- **Condition for "Yes":** The number of surplus moves (i.e., `n - m`) must be even and non-negative. This ensures that any extra moves can be balanced by pairs of add-remove operations.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1`. The function `func_1` reads `n` and `m`, and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment suggests that the program is incorrect due to a specific case where `n` is odd and `m` is 0. Let's verify this:

- **Case 1: `n < m`**
  - If `n < m`, it is impossible to reach `m` cubes with `n` moves since the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`. The condition `n - m >= 0` will fail, and the program correctly prints "No".

- **Case 2: `n >= m`**
  - If `n >= m`, the difference `n - m` represents the surplus moves. For the final number of cubes to be exactly `m`, these surplus moves must be even, allowing pairs of add-remove operations. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures this.

- **Specific Case: `n` is odd and `m` is 0**
  - If `n` is odd and `m` is 0, the surplus moves are `n - 0 = n`, which is odd. Since `n` is odd, it cannot be balanced by pairs of add-remove operations, and the final number of cubes will be 1, not 0. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` will fail, and the program correctly prints "No".

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly identifies a scenario where the program would fail. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd and `m` is 0. The conditions `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` are indeed sufficient to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
