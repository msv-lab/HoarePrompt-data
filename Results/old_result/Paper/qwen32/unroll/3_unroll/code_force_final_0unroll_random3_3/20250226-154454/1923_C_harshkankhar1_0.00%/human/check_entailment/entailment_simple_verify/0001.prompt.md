You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the given program and see if it correctly determines whether a subarray is "good" based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Recap:
1. A subarray is "good" if there exists an array `b` such that:
   - The sum of `a` (the subarray) equals the sum of `b`.
   - Each element `a_i` is not equal to `b_i`.
   - Each element `b_i` is greater than 0.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `q` (number of queries).
    - It reads the array `c` and creates an array `a` which is `c` with an extra 0 at the beginning for easier indexing.
    - It initializes an array `b` of length `n+1` with all zeros.

2. **Constructing `b`:**
    - For each element `a[i]` in the array `a` (from index 1 to `n`), it sets `b[i]` to `b[i-1] + x`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 if `a[i] <= 1`.
    - This step is intended to create a prefix sum array for `b` that could potentially satisfy the condition that the sum of `a` equals the sum of `b`.

3. **Accumulating `a`:**
    - The program converts `a` to a prefix sum array using `accumulate`.

4. **Processing Queries:**
    - For each query, it reads `x` and `y` (the start and end indices of the subarray).
    - It checks if the sum of the subarray `a[y] - a[x-1]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b[y] - b[x-1]` or if `x == y`.
    - If either condition is true, it prints "NO", otherwise it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Construction of `b`:** The construction of `b` is not correct in the context of the problem. The program is simply adding 1 or 2 to the previous value in `b` based on the value of `a[i]`, but it does not ensure that the sum of `b` will equal the sum of `a` for any subarray.
- **Incorrect Condition for "Good" Subarray:** The condition `a[y] - a[x-1] < b[y] - b[x-1]` does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good". The program also incorrectly returns "NO" if `x == y`, which is not necessarily true.
- **Lack of Verification:** The program does not verify that `a_i != b_i` for every index `i` in the subarray, which is a critical condition for the subarray to be "good".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" based on the given problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
