You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. For each character position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`:
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. If true, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If true, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
   - If neither condition is met, it continues to the next character.

The issue with this logic is that it only sets `possible` to `True` if there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are either the same and different from `c[i]`, or different from each other and `c[i]` does not match either. However, this does not guarantee that there exists a template `t` that matches `a` and `b` but not `c` for all positions.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
abc
abc
def
```
For this case, the program will output "NO" because for all positions `i`, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. However, there exists a template `t = "ABC"` that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`:
- For position 0: `a[0] = 'a'` and `b[0] = 'a'` match `t[0] = 'A'` (since `t[0]` is uppercase and different from `a[0]`).
- For position 1: `a[1] = 'b'` and `b[1] = 'b'` match `t[1] = 'B'` (since `t[1]` is uppercase and different from `a[1]`).
- For position 2: `a[2] = 'c'` and `b[2] = 'c'` match `t[2] = 'C'` (since `t[2]` is uppercase and different from `a[2]`).
- `c` does not match `t` because `c[0] = 'd'` is not different from `t[0] = 'A'`, `c[1] = 'e'` is not different from `t[1] = 'B'`, and `c[2] = 'f'` is not different from `t[2] = 'C'`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
