You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, which specifies a range within the array, the function determines and prints a specific pair of indices based on the values in the array within that range. The function does not return a value; instead, it outputs results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to process multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of queries. Each query asks us to find two different indices within a specified range such that the elements at these indices are not equal. If no such pair exists, we should return -1 -1.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then processes each query to find the required indices or determine that no such pair exists.

2. **Preprocessing the Array:**
   - The program creates a list `arr` that contains tuples representing contiguous segments of the array where all elements are the same. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the segment.
   - This preprocessing step is crucial for efficiently handling the queries.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in `arr` that starts at or after the left boundary of the query range.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a valid pair of indices can be found:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it checks if there is a previous segment that can provide the required pair.
     - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it checks if a valid pair can be found within the segment.
     - If the end of the segment is less than `N`, it checks the next segment.
     - If none of these conditions are met, it outputs -1 -1.

### Issues in the Program
- **Handling Edge Cases:** The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, when the query range contains only one segment, the program might incorrectly return -1 -1.
- **Incorrect Index Handling:** The program does not correctly handle the indices when the query range is small or when the segments are at the boundaries of the array.
- **Inefficient Query Handling:** The program uses a binary search to find the segment but does not correctly handle the logic for finding the valid pair within the segment or across segments.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. The logic for handling queries and finding valid pairs needs to be more robust and correctly implemented.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
