Reasoning:

The program provided aims to solve the "Permutation game" problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` (the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection**: The program detects the cycles in the permutation starting from Bodya's and Sasha's positions. It uses a visited list `vis` to track visited positions and appends the corresponding values from array `a` to `pathb` and `paths` for Bodya and Sasha respectively.

3. **Score Calculation**: For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve within `k` turns. It does this by iterating over the values in `pathb` and `paths` and calculating the score for staying in the current position for the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison of Scores**: After calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, the program compares the scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on who has the higher score or if they are equal.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Cycle Detection**: The method used for cycle detection is correct. It starts from the given position and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is visited again).

- **Score Calculation**: The score calculation logic is correct. It considers all possible ways to maximize the score by staying in the current position for the remaining turns. The formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` correctly calculates the score for staying in the current position for `k-i` turns.

- **Handling Large Values of k**: The program correctly handles large values of `k` by only iterating over the length of the cycle (since the values repeat after the cycle).

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than the length of the cycle by breaking out of the loop early.

- **Output**: The program correctly outputs "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison of the scores.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the "Permutation game" problem. It handles the input parsing, cycle detection, score calculation, and comparison of scores accurately.

Correctness: **True**
