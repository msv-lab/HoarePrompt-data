You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    9
    
    2 1 7
    
    2 1 1
    
    2 3 15
    
    3 3 6
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 4 7
    
    4 88 1000000000
    
    25 69 231
    
    13 97 18806

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. It then determines whether `a` is sufficiently large based on the values of `k` and `x` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the rules of the casino. There are several issues with the logic in the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Coins Required:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins required (`z`) to guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins by iterating through a loop and updating `z` based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. This logic does not correctly account for the conditions given in the problem description.
   - Specifically, the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately simulate the process of betting and winning/losing as described in the problem.

2. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - The program checks for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` separately, but the logic within these conditions is not correctly derived from the problem description.
   - For `x < k - 1`, the program only checks if `a >= x + 1`. This is not sufficient to guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins.
   - For `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 3`, which is also not a correct condition based on the problem's requirements.

3. **General Strategy:**
   - The problem requires a more sophisticated strategy to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins. The key is to ensure that Sasha can recover from up to `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.
   - The program does not correctly simulate this strategy and instead relies on incorrect conditions and calculations.

To correctly solve the problem, a more accurate approach would be to simulate Sasha's betting strategy and ensure that he can recover from up to `x` consecutive losses while maintaining enough coins to continue betting. The current program does not handle this correctly, and thus it is incorrect.

Here is a potential counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of Counterexample:**
- With `k = 3`, `x = 2`, and `a = 4`, Sasha can achieve any number of coins. For example, he can place bets as follows:
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 4 + 2 = 6 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 6 + 2 = 8 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and lose: 8 - 1 = 7 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 7 + 2 = 9 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 9 + 2 = 11 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and lose: 11 - 1 = 10 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and lose: 10 - 1 = 9 coins.
  - Bet 1 coin and win: 9 + 2 = 11 coins.
- Sasha can continue this strategy to achieve any number of coins, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this input.
