The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost of selling the buns, considering that the first bun is sold at the modified price `b`, and the remaining `n-1` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
