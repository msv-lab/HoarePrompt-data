The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. For each test case, it returns a value based on the provided inputs.**
