The code snippet `set_ = list(set(arr))` converts the list `arr` into a set to remove any duplicate elements and then converts it back into a list. This means that `set_` will contain only unique elements from `arr`.

Given the Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `A` is False.

After executing the code:
- `set_` will be a list containing unique elements from `arr`.
- The values of `arr` and `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr`; `A` is False.**
