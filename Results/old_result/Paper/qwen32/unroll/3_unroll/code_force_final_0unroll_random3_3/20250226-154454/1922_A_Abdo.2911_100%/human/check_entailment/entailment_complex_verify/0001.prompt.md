You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: t is 0; n, a, b, and c are the values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (where `n` is specified for each test case). It then checks if there exists at least one position `i` in the strings such that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine if there exists a template `t` that satisfies the following conditions:
1. Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Rules:
- If the `i-th` letter of the template is lowercase, the `i-th` letter of the string must be the same as the `i-th` letter of the template.
- If the `i-th` letter of the template is uppercase, the `i-th` letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the `i-th` letter of the template.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if there exists a valid template `t` for each position `i` such that:
1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` to make `c` not match the template while `a` and `b` match.
2. If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` to make `c` not match the template while `a` and `b` match.

The program sets the `possible` flag to `True` if it finds a valid template for any position `i` and breaks out of the loop. If no such position is found, it sets `possible` to `False`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if the program correctly implements the above logic:

1. **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
   - The program correctly checks if `c[i] != a[i]`. If this condition is true, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that `c` does not match the template while `a` and `b` do.

2. **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
   - The program correctly checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If this condition is true, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that `c` does not match the template while `a` and `b` do.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are of length `n` and consists of lowercase Latin letters.
   - The program also handles cases where `a` and `b` are identical or different for each position `i`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
