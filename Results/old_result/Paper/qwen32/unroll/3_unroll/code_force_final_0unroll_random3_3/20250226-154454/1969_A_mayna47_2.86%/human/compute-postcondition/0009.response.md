Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n], and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining n elements are the integers read from the input. If `n` is 2, the conditions on `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain as specified, and no additional changes occur. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.**
