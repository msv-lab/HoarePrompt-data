To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic step by step against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding pairs \((i, j)\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Key Observations:
For the conditions to hold:
- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

Combining these conditions, we need:
- \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

This can be rephrased using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or by checking pairs of residues directly.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the number of elements that have a specific pair of residues:
- `(num % x, num % y)`.

For each element in the array, it calculates:
- `r_x = -num % x` (which is equivalent to the residue of `-num` modulo `x`).
- `r_y = num % y`.

It then checks how many elements in `residue_map` have the pair `(r_x, r_y)`, which would make the current element `num` a valid pair with those elements.

Finally, it updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residue pair.

### Correctness Verification:
The logic in the program is correct:
- It accurately counts the number of valid pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic.
- The use of `residue_map` ensures efficient counting without requiring a nested loop over all pairs, which would be too slow given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles the constraints efficiently.

### Your Response:
Correctness: **True**
