Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program does not account for the process of adding new problems and removing the most difficult one after sorting. Instead, it simply counts how many times the difficulty in `b` is less than the difficulty in `a`, which does not reflect the correct procedure described in the problem statement.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to iteratively add new problems with the smallest possible difficulty (which can be assumed to be the smallest `b_i` that is not yet satisfied) and remove the highest difficulty problem from `a` until all `a_i` are less than or equal to the corresponding `b_i`.
