The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be converted to an integer and used to determine the number of iterations.

Given the problem statement, the variable `t` is described as the number of test cases, and it should be the value that the `input()` function returns. The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the input value is `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input value must be `t`**
