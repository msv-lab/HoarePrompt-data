Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several logical errors that can lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Here are a few issues that I've identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `Min` and `Max`:** The program calculates `Min` and `Max` using `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively. This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the values of `Min` and `Max` are used correctly to buy the jewels. The intention should be to determine a price that allows Alice to buy a certain number of jewels without exceeding her budget.

2. **Incorrect Update of `k` and `n`:** The program updates `k` and `n` based on `Min` and `Max` in a way that does not guarantee Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, the line `k = k - Max` or `k = k - Min` does not correctly reflect the number of jewels Alice is buying at each stall.

3. **Loop Conditions:** The loop condition `(n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k))` is not sufficient to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The condition `(n >= k)` is particularly problematic because it can prevent the loop from running if `n` is less than `k`, even if Alice can still buy `k` jewels by setting appropriate prices.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is much smaller than `k` or vice versa. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, the program might not be able to set prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

To illustrate one of these issues, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
100 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
5
20 20 20 20 20
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might not produce the expected output because of the incorrect logic for setting prices and updating `k` and `n`.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all possible inputs, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
