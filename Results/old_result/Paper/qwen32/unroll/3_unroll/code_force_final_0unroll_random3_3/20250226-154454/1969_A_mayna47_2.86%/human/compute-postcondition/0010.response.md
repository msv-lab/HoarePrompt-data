Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` is distinct, satisfies `1 <= p_i <= n`, and `p_i` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range [1, n]. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
