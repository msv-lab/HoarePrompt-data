Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, while string `c` does not. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. It initializes a variable `possible` to `False`, indicating that it has not yet found a position where a valid template can exist.
3. It iterates through each character position `i` in the strings:
   - If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop because it has found a position where `c` does not match the template that `a` and `b` do match.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If not, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop because it has found a position where `c` does not match the template that `a` and `b` do match.
4. After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The logic correctly implements the conditions for the template to exist. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then `c[i]` must be different to satisfy the condition. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, `c[i]` cannot match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` to satisfy the condition. If such a position is found, the template exists, and the output should be 'YES'. If no such position is found, the output should be 'NO'.

The execution summary aligns with the described logic, and the program correctly handles the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
