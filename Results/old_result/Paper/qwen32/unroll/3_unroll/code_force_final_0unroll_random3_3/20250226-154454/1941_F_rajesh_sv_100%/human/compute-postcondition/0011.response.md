To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated differences for each `f` in `F`.
- `next_max_diff` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer it is some value used for comparison.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
```

### Analysis:
- `ans` is the result of comparing its initial value with some calculated differences for each `f` in `F`. This means `ans` holds the smallest value between its initial value and the minimum of the differences.
- `next_max_diff` is another value that is being compared with `ans` using the `max` function. This means the `print` statement will output the greater of the two values: `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Output:
The output will be the greater value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Since the exact values of `ans` and `next_max_diff` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated differences for each f in F, and next_max_diff is another value being compared)**
