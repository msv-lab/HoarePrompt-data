Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all test cases. Let's analyze the logic and identify the potential issue.

The program attempts to determine the maximum profit by considering three scenarios:
1. If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
2. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, all buns are sold at the modified price, and the sum of the modified prices is calculated.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the profit by selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining at the usual price.

However, there is a logical error in the third scenario. The program does not correctly determine the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit. Instead, it incorrectly calculates the profit by using `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, which is not the correct formula to determine the maximum profit for a given `k`.

To correctly determine the maximum profit, we need to iterate through possible values of `k` (from 0 to `n`) and calculate the profit for each `k`. The correct approach involves calculating the sum of the first `k` modified prices and adding the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price `a`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        
        for k in range(n + 1):
            # Calculate profit for selling k buns at modified price
            modified_price_profit = sum(b - i for i in range(k))
            # Calculate profit for selling remaining buns at usual price
            usual_price_profit = (n - k) * a
            # Total profit for this k
            total_profit = modified_price_profit + usual_price_profit
            # Update max_profit if the current total_profit is higher
            max_profit = max(max_profit, total_profit)
        
        print(max_profit)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible values of `k`, calculates the profit for each, and keeps track of the maximum profit obtained. This ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
