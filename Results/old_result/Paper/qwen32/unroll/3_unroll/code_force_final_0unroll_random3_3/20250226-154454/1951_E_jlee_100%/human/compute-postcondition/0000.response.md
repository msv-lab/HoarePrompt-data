Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each of the t test cases is a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, and the sum of the lengths of all strings s across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The value of `t` is the integer input from the user.**

This means that the value of `t` has been updated to the integer input by the user, while the conditions and constraints for the test cases remain the same.
