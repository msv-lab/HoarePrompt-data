### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to process each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` keeps track of the smallest MEX value not yet used, and `maxx` keeps track of the maximum value encountered in the `mex` list.

2. **Processing the array `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, the smallest unused MEX value (`minn`) is appended to `mex`, and `minn` is incremented. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it is incremented again to ensure it remains the smallest unused MEX value.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is appended to `mex`. This step is intended to ensure that the MEX condition is satisfied, but the logic here seems flawed. The correct approach should be to directly use the MEX value that satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

3. **Output**:
   - The elements of `mex` are printed as the permutation `p`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for handling non-positive `arr[i]` values seems incorrect. The program calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends it to `mex`, but this does not guarantee that the resulting `p` will satisfy the MEX condition for all elements.
- The program does not correctly maintain the MEX property for all elements in `a`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for handling non-positive `arr[i]` values and maintaining the MEX property, the program is not guaranteed to produce a valid permutation `p` for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
