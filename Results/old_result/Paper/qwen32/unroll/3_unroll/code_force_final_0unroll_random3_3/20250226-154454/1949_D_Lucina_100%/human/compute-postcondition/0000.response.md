The given code snippet only reads an integer input `n` from the user, which represents the size of a square grid (n x n) with specific character constraints. The precondition about the grid and its contents remains unchanged as the code provided does not process or modify the grid data. The variable `n` is the only variable that gets a value in this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (same scenario). The j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line for all i and j. At most floor(n/2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.**
