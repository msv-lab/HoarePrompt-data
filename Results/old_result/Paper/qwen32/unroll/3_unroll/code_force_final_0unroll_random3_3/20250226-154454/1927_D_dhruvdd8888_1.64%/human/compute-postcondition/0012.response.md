The provided initial state includes several variables (`arr`, `s`, `num`, `LA`, `ppp`), but the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(nums)`. The variable `nums` is not mentioned in the initial state, which means it is not defined or initialized with any value before the `print` statement is executed.

Since `nums` is not defined, attempting to print it would result in a `NameError` indicating that the variable is not found.

Therefore, the output will be an error message, but since the task specifies to describe what would be printed based on the given information, and since `nums` is not defined, we can infer that the code would fail to execute the print statement as intended.

However, strictly adhering to the format and the given information without assuming additional context, we can describe the output as:

Output: **NameError: name 'nums' is not defined**
