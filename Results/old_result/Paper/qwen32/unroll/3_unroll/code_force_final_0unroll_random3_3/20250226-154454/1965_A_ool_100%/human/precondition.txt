arr is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The total number of piles across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
