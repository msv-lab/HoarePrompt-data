The code snippet initializes an empty list called `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `test_cases`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**
