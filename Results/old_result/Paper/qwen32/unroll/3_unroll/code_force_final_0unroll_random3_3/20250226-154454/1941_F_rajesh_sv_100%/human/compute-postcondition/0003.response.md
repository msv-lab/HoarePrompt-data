Functionality: **The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. Given that there are no parameters, it is inferred that the function relies on some predefined or globally defined variable `testcases` which is an integer representing the number of test cases and satisfies 1 <= testcases <= 10^4. The function returns a value based on the number of test cases, but the specific return value or logic is not provided in the given information.**
