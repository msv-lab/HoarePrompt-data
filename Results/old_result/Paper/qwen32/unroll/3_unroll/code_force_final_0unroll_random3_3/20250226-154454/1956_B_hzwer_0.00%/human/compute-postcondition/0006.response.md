To determine the output state after the loop, we need to understand the logic and how the `dp` table is being updated. The `dp` table is being filled based on the number of occurrences of each card value in the `cards` list.

Let's break down the loop:

1. The outer loop iterates over `i` from `n-3` down to `0`.
2. The inner loop iterates over `j` from `n-1` down to `0`.

For each `dp[i][j]`, the value is determined based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list:
- If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If `j + 1` appears once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

The initial values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` are both `0`.

After the loop completes, the `dp` table will be filled with values based on the above rules. The final output state will include the updated `dp` table, while `n` and `cards` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the initial integer inputted; `cards` is the initial list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with values updated based on the number of occurrences of each card value in `cards`.**
