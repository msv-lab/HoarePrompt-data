You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []

        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')

                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'

            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'

        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes each of the `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `x`. For each `x`, it performs a series of transformations on its binary representation, ultimately printing the modified binary string and its length after all transformations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Initial Binary Conversion**:
   - It initializes an empty list `s` and iterates through the first 30 bits of `x` (since `x < 2^30`).
   - For each bit, it checks if the bit is set (i.e., `x & (2^i) != 0`). If it is, it appends `'1'` to the list `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting the Binary Representation**:
   - It then iterates through the list `s` to adjust the values according to the problem's constraints:
     - If there are two consecutive `'1'`s, it changes the first one to `'-1'` and sets a flag indicating that the next `'0'` should be changed to `'1'`.
     - If the flag is set and a `'0'` is encountered, it changes the `'0'` to `'1'` and resets the flag.
     - If a `'1'` is encountered and the flag is not set, it checks if the next bit is also `'1'`. If so, it changes the current bit to `'-1'` and sets the flag.
     - If the flag is set and the end of the list is reached with a `'0'`, it changes the `'0'` to `'1'`.
     - If the flag is set and the end of the list is reached with a `'1'`, it changes the `'1'` to `'0'` and appends `'1'` to the list, increasing the length.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - It iterates through the list again to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.

5. **Output**:
   - It prints the length of the adjusted list and the list itself.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Initial Binary Conversion**:
   - The initial binary conversion is correct, but the output is not in the correct format. The problem requires the array to be printed with integers, not strings.

2. **Adjusting the Binary Representation**:
   - The logic for adjusting the binary representation is complex and not entirely correct. Specifically, the flag mechanism and the final adjustment loop do not correctly handle all cases.
   - For example, the program does not handle the case where the last bit is `'1'` and the flag is set correctly.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length and the array in the wrong order. The length should be printed first, followed by the array.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for adjusting the binary representation and the output format are incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
