You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):

            else:

                num = ar[i]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The logic in the code is flawed in a few ways:

1. The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive identical elements (`minn`) and prints this value as the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. However, this is not always the correct approach.

2. The program does not account for the specific operation allowed (choosing an index `i` such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`). The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that no such operation can make all elements the same.

3. The program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple segments of identical elements separated by different elements.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

This test case seems to work, but let's consider another:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1 2 1 3 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The program seems to work for this case as well, but let's consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
1 2 1 2 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `1`. To make the array non-beautiful, we need to remove at least `3` elements (e.g., remove the `2`s at indices 1, 3, and 5).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider segments of identical elements and determine the minimum number of elements to remove so that no segment can be extended to cover the entire array through the allowed operations.

The provided program does not handle these cases correctly, hence it is incorrect.
