Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) such that:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

### Key Observations:
- For two numbers \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) to satisfy the first condition, \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\). This implies that \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- For the second condition, \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\). This implies that \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

### Approach in the Program:
The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of the elements in the array modulo \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, for each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
- `r_x = -num % x`: This is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
- `r_y = num % y`: This is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

The key idea is to count how many times the pair of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) has appeared before in the array. This is done using the `residue_map` dictionary. If a pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has appeared `k` times before, it means there are `k` elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element.

### Implementation Details:
- The program iterates through each element of the array and updates the count of beautiful pairs based on the previously seen residues.
- It then updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the given example:
- For the first test case: `n=6`, `x=5`, `y=2`, `a=[1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
  - The pairs \((1, 5)\) and \((4, 6)\) are beautiful as per the problem statement.
  - The program correctly identifies these pairs and returns `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It efficiently uses a dictionary to keep track of residues and counts the pairs in linear time for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
