Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the way it updates the product of the array elements after each command. Specifically, the line `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD` are incorrect. The modulo operation does not distribute over division in the same way it does over multiplication, so simply dividing the current product by the removed element and taking the modulo will not yield the correct result.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3 5
2 3 4
LRR
```

Expected Output:
```
1 3 2
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
1. Initial product: \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24\), remainder when divided by 5 is \(24 \mod 5 = 4\).
2. Command 'L': Remove leftmost element (2), new array is [3, 4], product is \(3 \cdot 4 = 12\), remainder is \(12 \mod 5 = 2\).
3. Command 'R': Remove rightmost element (4), new array is [3], product is 3, remainder is \(3 \mod 5 = 3\).
4. Command 'R': Remove rightmost element (3), new array is [], product is 1 (since there are no elements), remainder is \(1 \mod 5 = 1\).

However, the program will output:
```
4 3 2
```

This is because the program incorrectly calculates the new product after removing an element by dividing the current product by the removed element and taking the modulo, which does not yield the correct result.

To fix this, the program should recalculate the product from scratch after each removal, or use a more sophisticated method to handle the product updates correctly.
