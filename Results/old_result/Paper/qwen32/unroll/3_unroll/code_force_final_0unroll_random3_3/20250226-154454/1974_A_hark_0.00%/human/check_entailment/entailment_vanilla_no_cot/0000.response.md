Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all test cases. Here are some issues with the code:

1. The logic for placing the 2x2 icons is incorrect. The code attempts to subtract 15 cells per 2x2 icon, which is not accurate. A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the placement of these icons should be considered carefully to maximize the use of the screen space.

2. The calculation for placing 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons is also incorrect. The code subtracts 15 cells per 2x2 icon and adds 4 cells per 2x2 icon, which does not make sense in the context of the problem.

3. There is an unnecessary `+1` in the calculation of `bxsfory1`, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_screens(x, y):
    # Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen
    max_2x2_per_screen = 2  # Since 2x2 icons take 4 cells, and 5x3 screen has 15 cells, max 2 can fit
    
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
    screens_for_2x2 = (y + max_2x2_per_screen - 1) // max_2x2_per_screen  # Ceiling division
    
    # Calculate remaining 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons
    remaining_1x1 = x - (screens_for_2x2 * (max_2x2_per_screen * 4))
    
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
    screens_for_1x1 = (remaining_1x1 + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
    
    # Total screens needed
    total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
    
    return total_screens

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        print(min_screens(x, y))

main()
```

This corrected program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons first, then calculates the remaining 1x1 icons, and finally calculates the number of screens needed for those 1x1 icons. It ensures that the placement of icons is optimized to use the screen space efficiently.
