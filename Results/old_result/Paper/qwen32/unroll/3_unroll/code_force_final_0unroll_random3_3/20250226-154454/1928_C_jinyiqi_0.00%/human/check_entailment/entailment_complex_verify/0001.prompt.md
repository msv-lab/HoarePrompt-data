You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    output1.reverse()

    #The program returns a list that first contains all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order, followed by all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reversed order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, first listing those that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order, followed by those that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in ascending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem involves determining the number of possible values of `k` such that in a sequence of numbers assigned to students based on a pattern, a student in position `n` receives number `x`. The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

### Key Points:
1. The sequence first increases from `1` to `k` and then decreases back to `2`.
2. The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
3. We need to find all possible values of `k` for which the sequence assigns number `x` to position `n`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, reads `n` and `x`.
2. **Logic**:
   - It checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even.
   - It then finds all divisors of these values using the `func_1` function.
   - For each divisor `s`, it checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It collects all valid `k` values and removes duplicates.
3. **Output**: The program should output the number of unique valid `k` values for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is referenced but not defined in the given code. This function is supposed to find all divisors of a given number. However, its implementation is missing.
2. **Appending to Output**: The program appends valid `k` values to the `output` list but never prints or returns this list. The final result should be the length of the `output` list, which is not done.
3. **Logic for Valid k**: The logic for determining valid `k` seems incorrect. The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is not sufficient to determine the correct `k`. The actual logic should involve checking the position within the repeating sequence.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program is not correct as it does not properly implement the logic to find all valid `k` values and does not output the results correctly.

**Correctness: False**
