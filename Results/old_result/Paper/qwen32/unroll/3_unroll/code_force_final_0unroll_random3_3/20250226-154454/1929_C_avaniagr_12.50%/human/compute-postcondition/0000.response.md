Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.**

Natural Language: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the input integer. The constraints on `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the code snippet.
