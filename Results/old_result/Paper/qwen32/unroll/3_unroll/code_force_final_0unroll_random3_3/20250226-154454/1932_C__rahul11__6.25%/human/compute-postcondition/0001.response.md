The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which corresponds to the variable `t` mentioned in the state description.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1, as the loop will iterate `t` times. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, and `MOD`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution count and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
