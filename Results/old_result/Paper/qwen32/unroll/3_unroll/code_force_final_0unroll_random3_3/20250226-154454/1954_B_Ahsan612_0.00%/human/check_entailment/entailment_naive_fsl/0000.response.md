Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The logic in the code is flawed in a few ways:

1. The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive identical elements (`minn`) and prints this value as the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. However, this is not always the correct approach.

2. The program does not account for the specific operation allowed (choosing an index `i` such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`). The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that no such operation can make all elements the same.

3. The program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple segments of identical elements separated by different elements.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

This test case seems to work, but let's consider another:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1 2 1 3 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The program seems to work for this case as well, but let's consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
1 2 1 2 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `1`. To make the array non-beautiful, we need to remove at least `3` elements (e.g., remove the `2`s at indices 1, 3, and 5).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider segments of identical elements and determine the minimum number of elements to remove so that no segment can be extended to cover the entire array through the allowed operations.

The provided program does not handle these cases correctly, hence it is incorrect.
