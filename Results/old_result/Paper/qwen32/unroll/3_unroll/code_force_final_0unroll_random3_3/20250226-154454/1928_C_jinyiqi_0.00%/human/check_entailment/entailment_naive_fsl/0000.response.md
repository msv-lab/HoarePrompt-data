Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the main problems:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is called within the main loop but is not defined anywhere in the given code. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is executed.

2. **Incomplete Output Handling**: The program calculates potential values of `k` and stores them in the `output` list, but it does not print the length of this list for each test case, which is required by the problem description.

3. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating `k` values seems incorrect. The conditions and calculations used do not match the problem description's requirements for determining valid `k` values.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n-1`, the logic might not work as expected.

To make the program correct, we need to:

- Define the `func_1` function properly.
- Ensure that the program prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
- Correct the logic for calculating valid `k` values based on the problem description.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if (2 * k - 2 - position_in_period) == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

This corrected version defines a function `count_valid_k` that calculates the number of valid `k` values for given `n` and `x`. It then iterates through each test case, calculates the result, and prints it. The logic correctly handles the periodic nature of the settling process and checks if the given position `n` corresponds to the number `x` for each possible `k`.
