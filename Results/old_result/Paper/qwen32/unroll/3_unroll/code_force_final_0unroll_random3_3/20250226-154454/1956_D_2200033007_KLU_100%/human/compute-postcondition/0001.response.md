The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it depends on the range defined by `i + 1`. For the loop to execute, the range must be at least 1, meaning `i + 1` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is a non-negative integer, `i + 1` will always be at least 1, ensuring the loop can execute. 

However, since `is_already_stairs` is `True` and does not affect the loop's execution directly, we do not need to adjust it. The only variable we need to ensure is that `i` is a non-negative integer, which is already stated.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `is_already_stairs` is `True`**
