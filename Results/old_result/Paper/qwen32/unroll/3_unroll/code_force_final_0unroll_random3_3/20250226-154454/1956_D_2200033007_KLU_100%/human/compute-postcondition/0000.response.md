The code snippet provided sets the variable `is_already_stairs` to `True`. This action does not affect the values of `i`, `start_index`, or `arr` as they are not mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `True` to `is_already_stairs`.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`; `is_already_stairs` is `True`.**
