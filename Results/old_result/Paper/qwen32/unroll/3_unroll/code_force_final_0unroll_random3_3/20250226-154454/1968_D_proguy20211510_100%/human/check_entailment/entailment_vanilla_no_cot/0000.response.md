Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in how it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering the sum of the values in their respective paths up to `k` turns, but it does not account for the possibility that the players might choose to stay in a position to maximize their score. 

The program should consider the cycle in the permutation and calculate the score for the entire cycle if `k` is large enough to allow completing a cycle multiple times. Additionally, if `k` is not a multiple of the cycle length, the program should consider the partial cycle that can be completed in `k` turns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start):
            cycle = []
            vis = [0] * n
            vis[start - 1] = 1
            current = start
            total_sum = 0
            while True:
                cycle.append(a[current - 1])
                total_sum += a[current - 1]
                current = p[current - 1]
                if vis[current - 1] == 1:
                    break
                vis[current - 1] = 1
            
            cycle_length = len(cycle)
            full_cycles = k // cycle_length
            remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
            
            score = full_cycles * total_sum + sum(cycle[:remaining_turns])
            return score
        
        score_b = calculate_score(pb)
        score_s = calculate_score(ps)
        
        if score_b > score_s:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_s > score_b:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the score for each player by considering the cycle in the permutation and the number of full cycles that can be completed within `k` turns, as well as the partial cycle for any remaining turns.
