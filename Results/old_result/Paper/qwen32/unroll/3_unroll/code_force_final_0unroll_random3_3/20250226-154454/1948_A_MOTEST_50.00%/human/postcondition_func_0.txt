The function processes `t` test cases, each with an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if `n` is 1. Otherwise, it constructs a string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string. The string is formed by repeating each letter twice, with an extra 'AAA' if `n` is odd. The function does not modify the input values `t` and `n` beyond using them to determine the output.
