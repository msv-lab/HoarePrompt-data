Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters. Instead, it generates a string of '1's and '0's, which does not meet the problem's requirements.

The program checks if `n` is odd and prints 'NO' if it is, which is correct because an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved with the given constraints (each special character must be paired with a non-special character or vice versa). However, when `n` is even, the program generates a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. This string does not consist of uppercase Latin letters and thus does not meet the problem's requirements.

For example, if `n = 2`, the program should output a string like "MM" or "AA", but it outputs "110110", which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program that generates a string of uppercase Latin letters:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

This version generates a string of alternating 'A's and 'B's, ensuring that there are exactly `n` special characters.
