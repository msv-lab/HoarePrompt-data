Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in `arr` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the next pair of lines contains an integer `n` representing the number of piles, and the following line contains `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if either the first condition is met (which is not explicitly described in the provided output details) or if a final value `A` is True. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.**
