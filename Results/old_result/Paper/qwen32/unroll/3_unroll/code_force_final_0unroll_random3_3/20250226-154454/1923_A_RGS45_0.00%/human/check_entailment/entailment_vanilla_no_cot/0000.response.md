Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not properly account for the necessary operations to achieve the goal.

Here's a brief analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program reads the input correctly but then converts the string of chip positions into another string without splitting it into individual integer values. This can lead to issues when trying to find the positions of the chips.
2. The program finds the first occurrence of '1' (x) and the first occurrence of '1' from the end (y). However, these positions are not used correctly to determine the number of operations needed.
3. The substring `z = arr[x:n - y]` is not correctly defined to represent the segment of the ribbon that needs to be considered. It does not accurately reflect the range of cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.
4. The program counts the number of '0's in this substring, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

A correct approach would involve identifying the leftmost and rightmost chips, then counting the number of free cells within the range of these two chips, as these free cells represent the minimum number of moves needed to bring all chips together into a single block.
