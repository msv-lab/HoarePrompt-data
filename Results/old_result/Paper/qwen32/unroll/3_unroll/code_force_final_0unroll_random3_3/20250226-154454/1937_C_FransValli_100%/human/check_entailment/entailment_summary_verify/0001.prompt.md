You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        maxi = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        arr = [0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        mini = arr[0]
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function determines and prints two indices `i` and `j` for each test case such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized among all pairs `(0 ≤ i, j < n)` for a given permutation `p` of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. It achieves this by interactively querying up to `3n` times per test case, comparing specific pairs of indices based on bitwise OR operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that the bitwise XOR of \(p_i\) and \(p_j\) is maximized. The maximum possible XOR value for any two integers in the range \([0, n-1]\) is \(n-1 \oplus 0 = n-1\) if \(n\) is even, or \(n-1 \oplus 1 = n-2\) if \(n\) is odd. This is because XOR between two numbers is maximized when their binary representations differ as much as possible.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `maxi` to 0.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The program iterates over the array from index 1 to \(n-1\) and compares the bitwise OR of `p[maxi]` with `p[i]` for each `i`.
   - If `p[maxi] | p[i]` is less than `p[i] | p[i]` (which is always true), it updates `maxi` to `i`. 
   - This loop is intended to find the maximum element in the array, but due to the nature of the OR operation and the fact that `p[i] | p[i]` is always the same as `p[i]`, it effectively finds an index with a large element value.

3. **Finding Candidates for Minimum Element**:
   - The program initializes an array `arr` with the first element as 0.
   - It then iterates over the array from index 1 to \(n-1\) and compares the bitwise OR of `p[maxi]` with `p[arr[0]]` against `p[maxi]` with `p[i]`.
   - If `p[maxi] | p[arr[0]]` is less than `p[maxi] | p[i]`, it updates `arr` to `[i]`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `i` to `arr`.
   - This step is supposed to find indices where `p[maxi] | p[i]` is the same as `p[maxi] | p[arr[0]]`, which could be potential candidates for the minimum element.

4. **Finding the Minimum Element Among Candidates**:
   - The program initializes `mini` to the first element of `arr`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements in `arr` and compares the bitwise OR of `p[mini]` with `p[mini]` against `p[mini]` with `item`.
   - If `p[mini] | p[mini]` is greater than `p[mini] | item`, it updates `mini` to `item`.
   - This loop is intended to find the minimum element among the candidates, but again, due to the nature of the OR operation, it doesn't correctly identify the minimum element.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints `! maxi mini`, which is supposed to be the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for finding the maximum element is flawed because it doesn't correctly identify the maximum element based on the OR operation.
- The logic for finding the minimum element among candidates is also flawed because it doesn't correctly identify the minimum element.
- The program does not guarantee that the XOR of `p[maxi]` and `p[mini]` will be the maximum possible XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value within the given constraints and limitations. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.
