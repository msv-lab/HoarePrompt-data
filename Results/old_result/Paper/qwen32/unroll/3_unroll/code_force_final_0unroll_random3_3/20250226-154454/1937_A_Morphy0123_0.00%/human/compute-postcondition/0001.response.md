For the given task, the loop head contains the variables `i` and `n_cases`. The loop will execute based on the value of `n_cases`. To ensure that the loop executes, `n_cases` must be at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting point for the `range` function in Python.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute for at least one iteration if there is at least one test case (`n_cases` is at least 1).
