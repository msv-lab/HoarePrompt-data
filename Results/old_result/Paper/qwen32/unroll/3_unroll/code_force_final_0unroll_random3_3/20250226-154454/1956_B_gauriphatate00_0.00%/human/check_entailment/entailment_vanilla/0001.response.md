### Reasoning:

The problem is about a card game where each player has `n` cards, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck. The game consists of `2n` turns, with each player taking `n` turns. The goal is to maximize the number of points, where a point is awarded if a player places a card on the table that already has a matching card.

The strategy for the players is as follows:
- **You** want to maximize your points.
- **Nene** wants to maximize her points and, in case of a tie, minimize your points.

Let's analyze the provided solution:

1. **Counting Pairs:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) in your hand, i.e., the number of integers that appear exactly twice.
   - The maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs in your hand and `n // 2`. This is because you can only get a point if you place a card that already has a matching card on the table, and there are only `n` turns for you to place cards.

2. **Reading Input and Processing Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input, which consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - It computes the result for each test case using `func_1(n, a)` and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. The strategy is sound because:
- You can only score points when you have a pair of cards.
- Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the best you can do is to play optimally yourself, which means placing cards that can potentially form pairs.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given the constraints and the behavior of Nene.

**Correctness: True**
