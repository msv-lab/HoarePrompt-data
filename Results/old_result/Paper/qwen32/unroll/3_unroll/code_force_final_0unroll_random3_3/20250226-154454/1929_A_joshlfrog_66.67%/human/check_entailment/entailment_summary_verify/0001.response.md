Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when arranged in a specific order:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

Thus, to maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the largest element is at the end and the smallest element is at the beginning. Therefore, the maximum beauty is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) elements, and then calculating the difference `x - y`. This aligns with the optimal strategy derived from the problem analysis.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the length of the array `l`.
   - Read the array elements into the list `nums`.
   - Initialize `x` to 0 (which will store the maximum element).
   - Initialize `y` to 100000000 (which will store the minimum element).
   - Iterate through the array:
     - Update `x` to the maximum of `x` and the current element.
     - Update `y` to the minimum of `y` and the current element.
   - Print the difference `x - y`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements in the array and computes their difference, which is the maximum possible beauty of the array. The initialization of `x` to 0 and `y` to 100000000 is generally safe because:
- `x` starts at 0, and the smallest possible input value is 1, so it will be updated to the smallest element in the array.
- `y` starts at 100000000, and the largest possible input value is \(10^9\), so it will be updated to the largest element in the array.

However, there is a subtle issue with the initializations:
- If all elements in the array are greater than 0 and less than 100000000, the initial value of `y` will not affect the final result because `y` will be updated to the smallest element in the array.
- But if any element in the array is exactly 0, the initial value of `x` will not be updated correctly because the maximum element in the array could be 0, and `x` will remain 0.

### Example:
Consider an array with elements `[0, 1, 2]`. The program will:
- Initialize `x` to 0 and `y` to 100000000.
- Iterate through the array:
  - `x` remains 0 because the maximum element is 2, but `x` was initialized to 0.
  - `y` becomes 0 because the smallest element is 0.
- The difference `x - y` will be `0 - 0 = 0`, which is incorrect. The correct maximum beauty should be `2 - 0 = 2`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where the maximum element in the array is 0 correctly due to the initial value of `x`. This makes the program incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the improper initialization of `x` and `y`. The correct initialization should be to set `x` to a very small number (like negative infinity) and `y` to a very large number (like positive infinity) to ensure that the maximum and minimum elements in the array are correctly identified.
