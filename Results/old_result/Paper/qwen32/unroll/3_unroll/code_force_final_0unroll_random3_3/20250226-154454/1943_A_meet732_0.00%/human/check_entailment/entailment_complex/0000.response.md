Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the given problem description and the annotated states.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` (which initially is empty).
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- We need to determine the final MEX of `c` if both players play optimally.

### Strategy:
- Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX while Bob will try to minimize it.
- The game ends when all elements from `a` are moved to `c` or removed from `a`.
- The MEX of `c` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` at the end of the game.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Counting Occurrences:** The program counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using `cntl`, where `cntl[i]` holds the count of integer `i` in `a`.
2. **Handling Zeros:** If there are no zeros in `a` (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer and it is not present in `c`.
3. **Counting Pairs:** If there are zeros, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of `2` or the count of zeros (`cntl[0]`).
4. **Iterating Through Counts:** The program then iterates through the counts starting from `1` up to `n`. For each integer `j`, if there are fewer than `2` occurrences (`cntl[j] < 2`), it decrements `c`. If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

### Correctness Check:
- **Initial Zero Handling:** If there are no zeros in `a`, the MEX is correctly identified as `0`.
- **Pair Counting:** The program correctly identifies the smallest integer `j` such that there are fewer than `2` occurrences in `a` by decrementing `c` for each such integer. This ensures that the MEX is correctly determined based on the counts.
- **Optimal Play:** The logic inherently reflects optimal play by both Alice and Bob because the MEX is determined based on the counts of elements, which directly affects the smallest missing integer in `c`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` are moved to `c` or removed from `a`, considering optimal play by both Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
