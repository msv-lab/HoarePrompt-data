Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` where:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

### Provided Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(test_cases)`: This function processes the test cases and calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, parses the test cases, and calls `func_1` to process them.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
The core logic of the program is in `func_1`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Initialization**: A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
2. **Loop through array**: For each element `a` in the array:
   - Calculate `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` which is equivalent to `(x - a % x) % x` to handle negative remainders.
   - Calculate `ry = a % y`.
   - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add the count from `freq` to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - Update the frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

### Verification of Logic:
1. **Handling of Remainders**:
   - `rx` is calculated as `(x - a % x) % x` to ensure it is always non-negative.
   - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
   - When processing each element `a`, it checks how many previous elements have a pair `(rx, ry)` that would make the current element `a` form a beautiful pair with them.

3. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - For a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful, `a_i + a_j` should be divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `y`.
   - This translates to `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0` and `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0`.
   - The program correctly handles this by checking for pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx` is `(x - a_i % x) % x` and `ry` is `a_i % y`.

### Edge Cases Considered:
1. **Negative Remainders**: The program correctly handles negative remainders by adjusting `rx` to be non-negative.
2. **Multiple Occurrences**: The use of a dictionary to track frequencies ensures that multiple occurrences of the same pair are correctly counted.
3. **Large Inputs**: The program efficiently processes up to `2 * 10^5` elements per test case, which is within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and handling of different cases, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

**Correctness: True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and efficiently using a dictionary to track the frequencies of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`. It handles negative remainders, multiple occurrences, and large inputs within the given constraints.
