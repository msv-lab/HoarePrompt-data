The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the configuration of stone piles across multiple test cases. It accepts a list `arr` where the first element is the number of test cases, followed by pairs of lines for each test case: the first line specifies the number of piles, and the second line specifies the number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if a specific condition related to the uniqueness and consecutiveness of stone counts is met, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.
