The function reads an integer `cases` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` and processes it to produce three characters as output. The output for each test case consists of three characters derived from the values in a sorted array `arr` after processing `lex`. The values of `cases` and `lex` remain unchanged after the function execution.
