The code snippet assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are modified by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the assignment of `ans` to `max_diff`, while all other variables retain their initial state values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `A` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`. `D` is a sorted list of unique values returned by `func_4()`. `F` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`. `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`. `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`. `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found. `left` is `A[index - 1]`. `right` is `A[index]`. `ans` is `max_diff`.**
