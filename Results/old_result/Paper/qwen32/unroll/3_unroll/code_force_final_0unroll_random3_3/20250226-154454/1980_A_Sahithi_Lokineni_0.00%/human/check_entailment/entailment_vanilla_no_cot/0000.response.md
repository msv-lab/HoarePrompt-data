Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed for each round. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the number of problems to create.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and the issues in the code:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vlad needs `m` rounds, each containing problems of all 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G').
   - He already has `n` problems with given difficulties.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed so that each of the `m` rounds can have one problem of each difficulty level.

2. **Logic in the Code**:
   - The code uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string.
   - For each difficulty level, it checks if the count is less than or equal to `m`. If so, it adds the difference (`m - count`) to the answer (`ans`).
   - This logic is flawed because it does not account for the fact that each round requires one problem of each difficulty level. The code should check if the count of each difficulty level is at least `m` and then calculate the shortfall.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each test case, initialize a counter for each difficulty level.
   - Count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string.
   - For each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m`, calculate the difference and add it to the total number of problems to be created.
   - The correct logic should be:
     ```python
     from collections import defaultdict

     t = int(input())
     while t > 0:
         t -= 1
         (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
         s = input()
         d = defaultdict(int)
         for i in range(n):
             d[s[i]] += 1
         ans = 0
         for val in 'ABCDEFG':
             if d[val] < m:
                 ans += m - d[val]
         print(ans)
     ```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed for each round. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
