The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most twice. The function processes each test case by calling `func_1` with `n` and `a`, and collects the results. It then prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program includes the printed results for all test cases, while the input variables remain unchanged.
