### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the sum of penalties `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The penalty `p(b)` of a subsequence `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i+1]`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates through the array `a` and maintains two variables `x` and `y`, both initialized to `n + 1`. The variable `ans` keeps track of the number of times a specific condition is met.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. Initialize `x` and `y` to `n + 1` (a value greater than any element in the array).
2. For each element `a` in the array:
   - If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, update `x` to `a`.
   - Otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, update `y` to `a`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it incorrectly checks `x == y` (which is always false since `x` and `y` are never equal due to the previous conditions), and then updates `y` to `a` and increments `ans` by 1.

#### Flaw in the Program:
The logic in the program is flawed. The condition `x == y` is unnecessary and does not affect the logic. More importantly, the increment of `ans` should happen when `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, indicating that `a` cannot be added to either `s` or `t` without increasing the penalty. However, the program incorrectly increments `ans` in the else block, which is triggered when `a` is greater than `y`, but not necessarily greater than `x`.

#### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. The increment of `ans` is not based on the correct condition, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
