The function processes an n x n grid of characters ('F', 'S', '?', '.'), where 'F' and 'S' represent specific attributes, '?' are undecided, and '.' indicates the same scenario as another cell. It counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each row/column, then replaces '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the counts and specific conditions, ensuring that the number of 'F' and 'S' does not exceed certain limits. The function outputs the modified grid.
