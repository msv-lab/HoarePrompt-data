You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the length of the array), x (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), y (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array).
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. Each tuple represents the parsed data for one test case. `input` remains unchanged as the content read from standard input. `data` remains unchanged as a list where each element is a line from the input content. `t` remains unchanged as an integer representing the number of test cases. `idx` is now `2 * t + 1`, reflecting the position after processing all test cases.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The output state is such that each result from the `results` list is printed on a new line. The variables `test_cases`, `input`, `data`, `t`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the length of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). The function returns a value based on the given conditions for each tuple in `test_cases`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
