You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

It interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a hidden permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, where \(\oplus\) is the bitwise XOR operation. We can ask queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\), where \(\mid\) is the bitwise OR operation. We are allowed to make at most \(3n\) queries.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\).

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It iterates over all indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and asks a query of the form "? mak mak i i". This is to compare the OR value of \(p_{mak}\) with itself and \(p_i\) with itself.
   - If the result of the query is "<" (i.e., \(p_{mak} < p_i\)), it updates `mak` to \(i\). This step is intended to find an index with the maximum OR value.

3. **Finding Indices with Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mak2` to the value of `mak` found in the previous step.
   - It then iterates over all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) and asks a query of the form "? mak mak2 i mak2". This is to compare the OR value of \(p_{mak}\) with \(p_{mak2}\) and \(p_i\) with \(p_{mak2}\).
   - If the result of the query is "<" (i.e., \(p_{mak} < p_i\)), it updates `mak` to \(i\) and adds \(i\) to the list `pans`.
   - If the result of the query is "=" (i.e., \(p_{mak} = p_i\)), it adds \(i\) to the list `pans`. This step is intended to find all indices that have the maximum OR value.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Value:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It then iterates over all indices in the list `pans` and asks a query of the form "? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]". This is to compare the OR value of \(p_{pans[mak]}\) with itself and \(p_{pans[i]}\) with itself.
   - If the result of the query is ">" (i.e., \(p_{pans[mak]} > p_{pans[i]}\)), it updates `mak` to \(i\). This step is intended to find an index in `pans` with the maximum OR value.
   - Finally, it prints "! mak2 mak" as the answer.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Query Logic:**
   - The queries used in the program are not correctly designed to help find the indices with the maximum XOR value. The queries are comparing OR values of elements with themselves, which doesn't provide any useful information about the XOR values.

2. **Incorrect Interpretation of Results:**
   - The program interprets the results of the queries incorrectly. The queries are not designed to help find the maximum XOR value, so the interpretation of the results doesn't lead to the correct indices.

3. **Lack of XOR Calculation:**
   - The program does not actually calculate or compare XOR values anywhere in the code. It only compares OR values, which is not sufficient to find the indices with the maximum XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not use the queries to find the indices with the maximum XOR value. The logic and interpretation of the queries are incorrect.
