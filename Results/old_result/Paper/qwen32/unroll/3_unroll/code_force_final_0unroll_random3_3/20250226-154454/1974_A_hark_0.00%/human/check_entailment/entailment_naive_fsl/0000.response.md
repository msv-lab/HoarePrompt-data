Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid.
- There are x applications with 1x1 icons and y applications with 2x2 icons.
- Determine the minimum number of screens needed to place all icons.

### Analysis of the Provided Program
The program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. It's not used anywhere in the program.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons and calculates the minimum number of screens needed.
3. `func_3()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

Let's focus on `func_2()` as it contains the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens.

#### Key Points in `func_2()`
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
  - It calculates `bxsfory` (best x slots for y) as the ceiling of `y / 2`.
  - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` from `x`.
  - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of `x / 15` plus 1 if `x` is greater than 0.
  - Finally, it prints `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
  - It prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
  - It prints the ceiling of `x / 15`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0:
  - It prints 0.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Slots for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The logic for calculating `bxsfory` and adjusting `x` is incorrect. The formula `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not accurately represent the number of cells occupied by `y` 2x2 icons and `x` 1x1 icons.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell. The program does not correctly account for the arrangement of these icons on a 5x3 grid.

2. **Incorrect Adjustment of `x`**:
   - The adjustment of `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. This formula does not accurately reflect the number of cells occupied by the icons.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `bxsfory1`**:
   - The calculation of `bxsfory1` is incorrect. The program adds 1 to the ceiling of `x / 15` without considering the actual arrangement of icons on the grid.

### Example Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness
Consider the input:
```
1
15 0
```
The expected output is `1` because 15 1x1 icons can fit on a single 5x3 grid (15 cells).

However, the program calculates:
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(15 / 15) + 1 = 2`
- And prints `2`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given inputs. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
