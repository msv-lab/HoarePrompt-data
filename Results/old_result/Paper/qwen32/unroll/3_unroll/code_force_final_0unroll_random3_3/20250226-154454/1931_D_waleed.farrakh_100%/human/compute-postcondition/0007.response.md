The code snippet `results = func_1(test_cases)` calls the function `func_1` with `test_cases` as its argument and assigns the return value to the variable `results`. This means `results` will now hold whatever value is returned by `func_1`.

The other variables mentioned in the initial state (`input`, `data`, `t`, and `idx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. `input` remains unchanged as the content read from standard input. `data` remains unchanged as a list where each element is a line from the input content. `t` remains unchanged as an integer representing the number of test cases. `idx` is `2 * t + 1`. `results` holds the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.**
