Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 <= b_j <= 10^6; The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been updated to the integer value provided by the input, while all other variables and conditions remain as specified in the initial state.
