Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error in Checking if the Array is Beautiful**: The program checks if the array is entirely composed of the same element by iterating through the array and checking if each element is equal to the previous one. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False`. However, this is not the correct way to determine if an array is beautiful as per the problem statement. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with one of its neighbors if they are equal. The program does not implement this logic.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Elements to Remove**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove by finding the minimum count of consecutive identical elements. However, this logic is flawed. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array is no longer beautiful. The current implementation does not consider the correct conditions for an array to be beautiful after removals.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly outputs `-1` if the array is entirely composed of the same element, but it fails to handle other cases correctly.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to implement logic to determine the minimum number of removals required to break the beautiful property of the array. This typically involves more complex analysis of the array structure and the possible operations allowed.
