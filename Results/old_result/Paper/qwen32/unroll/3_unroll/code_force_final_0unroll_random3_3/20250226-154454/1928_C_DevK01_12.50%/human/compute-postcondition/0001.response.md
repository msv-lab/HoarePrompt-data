The code attempts to assign the square root of the list `q` to the variable `w`. However, the `math.sqrt()` function in Python is designed to compute the square root of a single number, not a list or a list of tuples. This will result in a `TypeError` because the operation is not valid for the given input type.

Since the operation is invalid and will raise an error, the variable `w` will not be assigned a value, and the state of the program will not change in terms of the variables `q` and `M`. The code does not proceed to any further operations that would affect these variables.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list.**
