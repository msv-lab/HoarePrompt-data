Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`, decremented by 1; `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i)`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is now equal to `i - 1`. The list `res` still includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are set to `i - 1`.**

In simpler terms: The function `make_stairs` is called with `i - 1`, so `i` is decremented by 1. The variable `is_already_stairs` remains `False`. The element `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is set to `i - 1`. The list `res` still contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`. All elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are set to `i - 1`.
