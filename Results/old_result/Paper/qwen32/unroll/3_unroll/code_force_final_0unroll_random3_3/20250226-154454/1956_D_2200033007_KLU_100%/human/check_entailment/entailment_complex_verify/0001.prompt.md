You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. If `arr[start_index + i]` was equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1, `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is set to `i - 1`, the list `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` are set to `i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` modifies the array `arr` by setting a sequence of elements starting from `start_index` to a specific pattern based on the value of `i`. It also appends tuples to the list `res` indicating the range of indices modified. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a specific operation up to 500,000 times. The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the subarray), and setting all elements of the subarray to this MEX value.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by recursively considering different ways to partition the subarray and computing the MEX for each partition.
    - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
    - The function considers three main cases:
        1. If the subarray length is 1, the maximum value is either 1 or the current element, whichever is larger.
        2. If the subarray can be transformed into a perfect staircase (0, 1, 2, ..., length-1), the maximum sum is the square of the length.
        3. Otherwise, it tries to split the subarray into smaller subarrays and compute the sum recursively.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
    - It recursively determines which subarray partitions yield the maximum sum and constructs the corresponding operations.
    - If the subarray can be transformed into a perfect staircase, it calls `make_stairs` to generate the necessary operations.
    - Otherwise, it splits the subarray and recursively constructs operations for the partitions.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
    - This function generates the operations needed to transform a subarray into a perfect staircase (0, 1, 2, ..., length-1).
    - It recursively sets the elements of the subarray to the appropriate values and records the operations.
    - If the subarray is already a perfect staircase, no operations are needed.

### Potential Issues:
- **Global Variables**: The program uses global variables (`arr`, `res_dict`, `res`, `start_index`) which can lead to issues if the functions are called multiple times or if the program is run in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Memoization Key**: The memoization key in `func_1` is `(start_index, end_index)`, which is appropriate for the problem but the global nature of `res_dict` could cause issues if not reset between different runs.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like subarray length 1 and perfect staircases, but it might not handle all edge cases explicitly.
- **Correctness of Operations**: The operations generated by `func_2` and `make_stairs` need to be verified to ensure they correctly transform the array into the configuration that yields the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
While the program seems to follow a logical approach to solve the problem, there are concerns regarding the use of global variables and the correctness of the operations generated. However, based on the provided examples and the logic described, the program appears to be correct within the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
