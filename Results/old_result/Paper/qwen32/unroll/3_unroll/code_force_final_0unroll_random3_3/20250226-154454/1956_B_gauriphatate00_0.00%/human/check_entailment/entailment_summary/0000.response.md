### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Maximize the score (points) you can get by playing optimally in a card game.
- **Game Rules**:
  - There are `2n` cards, with each integer from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice.
  - Cards are distributed between you and Nene, each getting `n` cards.
  - Players alternate turns, and each player gets a point if they play a card that already has a matching card on the table.
  - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

#### Functions Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Determine the maximum number of points you can get.
   - **Logic**: 
     - Count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` (your hand).
     - Return the minimum of this count and `n // 2`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the best strategy for you is to play cards that are paired in your hand as early as possible, assuming Nene will play optimally.
     - The number of pairs in your hand is the maximum number of points you can get because each pair can contribute one point if you play the second card of the pair after Nene has played the first.
     - However, since Nene plays optimally, she will prevent you from getting more than `n // 2` points because she will block your pairs if possible. Thus, the result is the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Handle multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.
   - **Logic**:
     - Read input from standard input.
     - For each test case, extract `n` and the list `a`.
     - Call `func_1` with `n` and `a` to get the result for that test case.
     - Collect all results and print each one.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly processes multiple test cases.
     - It uses `func_1` to compute the result for each test case, which is correct based on the logic explained above.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis of both functions, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, considering Nene's optimal play.

**Correctness: True**
