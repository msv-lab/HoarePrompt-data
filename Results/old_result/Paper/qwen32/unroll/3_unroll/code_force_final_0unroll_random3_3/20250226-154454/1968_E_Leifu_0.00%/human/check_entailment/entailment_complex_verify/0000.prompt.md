You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')

            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
        
    #State: For each test case, the output consists of the lines `1 1`, `1 2`. If `n` is 3, it includes `2 3`. If `n` is greater than 3, it includes `2 4` followed by `j j` for `j` from 4 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`. For each test case, it outputs specific pairs of numbers based on the value of `n`. It always outputs `1 1` and `1 2`. If `n` is 3, it outputs `2 3`. If `n` is greater than 3, it outputs `2 4` followed by `j j` for each `j` from 4 to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). The program only handles specific cases for \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\) correctly, but it fails to generalize for larger values of \(n\).

Here are some specific issues with the code:

1. **For \(n = 2\)**: The program outputs the points (1,1) and (1,2), which is correct as it maximizes \(\mathcal{H}\) to {0, 1}.

2. **For \(n = 3\)**: The program outputs the points (1,1), (1,2), and (2,3), which is correct as it maximizes \(\mathcal{H}\) to {0, 1, 2, 3}.

3. **For \(n \geq 4\)**: The program outputs points (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and then (4,4), (5,5), ..., (n,n) for \(n \geq 4\). This does not maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\) because it does not cover all possible distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \(n = 4\):
- The program outputs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)
- The set of Manhattan distances is: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- However, a better arrangement could be: (1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4)
- This arrangement gives the set of Manhattan distances: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, which is larger.

Thus, the program does not handle the cases for \(n \geq 4\) correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
