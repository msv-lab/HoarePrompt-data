Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum accumulated values for two entities, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', and prints the name of the entity with the higher accumulated value, or 'Draw' if they are equal.**
