The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used. However, the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which corresponds to `t` in the provided state.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, the loop will execute `t` times. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, there is no need to adjust its state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440**
