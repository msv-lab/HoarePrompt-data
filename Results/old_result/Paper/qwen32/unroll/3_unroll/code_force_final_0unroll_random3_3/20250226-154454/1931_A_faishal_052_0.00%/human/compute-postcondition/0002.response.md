To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the provided code step-by-step:

1. The outer loop runs `cases` times.
2. For each iteration of the outer loop:
   - An empty list `arr` is initialized.
   - An integer `lex` is read from the input.
   - The inner loop runs twice:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `1` is appended to `arr`, and `lex` is decremented by 1.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `26` is appended to `arr`, and `lex` is decremented by 26.
     - If `lex` is 52 or more, `26` is appended to `arr`, and `lex` is decremented by 26.
   - After the inner loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is sorted.
   - The first three elements of the sorted `arr` are converted to characters (using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`) and printed without a newline character.

The variables `t` and `n` are not modified or used within the loop, so their values remain unchanged.

The output of the loop for each iteration is three characters derived from the values in `arr` after sorting. The final output state will be the concatenation of these three-character strings for each of the `cases` iterations.

Since the exact values of `lex` for each iteration are not provided, we cannot determine the exact output strings. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the loop's behavior.

Output State: **The output state consists of three characters for each of the `cases` iterations, derived from the sorted values in `arr` after processing each `lex` input. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**
