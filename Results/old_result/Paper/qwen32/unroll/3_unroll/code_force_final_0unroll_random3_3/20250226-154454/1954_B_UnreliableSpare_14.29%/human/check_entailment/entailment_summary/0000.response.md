### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The key points to consider are:

1. **Identical Array Case**: If all elements in the array are the same, the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, the program should return `-1` in this case. The program correctly handles this by checking if all elements are the same and setting the flag `flag` to `False` if it finds any differing elements. If `flag` remains `True` after the loop, it prints `-1`.

2. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Identical Elements**: The program aims to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements that are the same. If a different element is encountered, the program updates the answer `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found so far. After the loop, it also considers the last sequence of identical elements by performing `ans = min(ans, cnt)`.

3. **Output**: Based on the flag and the minimum count of consecutive identical elements, the program outputs `-1` if all elements are the same, or the minimum count otherwise.

### Analysis of Execution Summary:

The execution summary indicates that the program reads the input, processes each test case, and determines the minimum length of consecutive identical elements. This aligns with the intended logic of the program. The program correctly identifies when the array consists of identical elements and outputs `-1` in that case. For other cases, it correctly computes the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
