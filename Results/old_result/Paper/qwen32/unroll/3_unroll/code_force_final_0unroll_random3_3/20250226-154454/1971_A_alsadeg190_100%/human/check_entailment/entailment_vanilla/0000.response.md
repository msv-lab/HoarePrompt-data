Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the first line of input, which is the number of test cases (t). This is correctly handled by `x = int(input())`.
2. It then enters a loop that will run `t` times (`for i in range(x):`).
3. Inside the loop, it reads two integers from each line of input, which are the values of `x` and `y` for that test case. This is correctly handled by `(x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))`.
4. The program then compares `x` and `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`. If `x` is not less than `y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`. This logic correctly ensures that the minimum value is printed first, followed by the maximum value.
5. The program handles all given constraints: there are between 1 and 100 test cases, and the values of `x` and `y` are between 0 and 9.

Since the program correctly reads the input, processes each test case as described in the problem statement, and prints the results in the correct format, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
