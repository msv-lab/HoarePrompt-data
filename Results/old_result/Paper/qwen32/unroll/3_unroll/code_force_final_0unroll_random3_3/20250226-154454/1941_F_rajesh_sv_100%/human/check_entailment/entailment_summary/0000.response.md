### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to accept a function `func` and return a `wrapper` function. However, the code provided for `func_1` is incomplete and does not define `wrapper` within its scope. This function is supposed to implement memoization, but the current implementation is incorrect and incomplete.
   - `func_2` reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. This function is correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads a line from standard input using `func_2` and converts it to an integer. This function is correctly implemented.

3. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function reads a line from standard input using `func_2`, splits it by a specified delimiter (default is a space), and converts each split segment into an integer. This function is correctly implemented.

4. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function reads a line from standard input using `func_2` and returns it. This function is correctly implemented.

5. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function reads the input for a single test case, calculates the initial maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `A`, and then iterates through each element in list `F` to find the optimal element in list `D` to minimize the maximum of two specific differences.
   - The function uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find the correct position in `D` for each element in `F`.
   - The function then calculates the potential new maximum difference and updates the answer if a smaller difference is found.
   - Finally, the function prints the maximum of the original maximum difference and the computed minimum difference.
   - This function is correctly implemented based on the problem description.

6. **Function `func_7`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case by calling `func_6()` for each one. This function is correctly implemented.

### Issue:
- The primary issue lies in `func_1`, which is incomplete and does not define `wrapper` within its scope. This function is intended to implement memoization, but its current implementation is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given that `func_1` is incomplete and does not fulfill its intended purpose, the program as a whole cannot be considered correct.

### Correctness: **False**
