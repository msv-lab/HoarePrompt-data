### Reasoning:

To determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins under the given conditions, we need to analyze the strategy based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

1. **Understanding the Strategy:**
   - **Winning:** If Sasha wins, he gains `y * (k - 1)` coins.
   - **Losing:** If Sasha loses, he loses `y` coins.
   - **Consecutive Losses:** Sasha can only lose `x` times in a row.

2. **Conditions for "YES":**
   - **Case 1:** If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can guarantee to win by betting strategically. He needs at least `x + 1` coins to ensure he can handle up to `x` consecutive losses and still have enough to bet again.
   - **Case 2:** If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs slightly more coins to ensure he can handle the scenario. He needs at least `x + 2` coins.
   - **Case 3:** If `x > k - 1`, Sasha can use a more complex strategy involving larger bets to ensure he can recover from losses. The program calculates the minimum number of coins required using a loop that simulates the process of recovering from losses.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
   - It checks the conditions described above and prints "YES" if Sasha can achieve any number of coins, otherwise "NO".

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the three cases based on the relationship between `x` and `k`.
   - For `x > k - 1`, the program uses a loop to calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can recover from any sequence of up to `x` consecutive losses.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
