To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to focus on the variables that are affected by the loop. In this case, the loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input, and during each iteration, it calls the function `func_1()`. 

However, the problem statement does not provide any information about the contents of `func_1()` or any variables that might be modified by it. Therefore, we can only conclude that `func_1()` is called a number of times equal to the integer value provided by the user input.

Since there are no variables in the loop head or body that are explicitly modified or tracked, we cannot determine the state of any specific variables. The only thing we can state is the number of times `func_1()` was called.

Given the lack of information about the internal state changes within `func_1()`, the output state can only describe the number of iterations the loop performed.

Output State: **The function `func_1()` was called `int(input())` times.**
