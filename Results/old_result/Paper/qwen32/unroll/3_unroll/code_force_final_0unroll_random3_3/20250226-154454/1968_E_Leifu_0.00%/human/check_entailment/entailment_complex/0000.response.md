Reasoning:  
The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze the logic and the outputs for different values of \(n\):

1. For \(n = 2\):
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\)
   - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.

2. For \(n = 3\):
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\)
     - \(|2-1| + |3-2| = 2\)
     - \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\)
   - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct.

3. For \(n > 3\):
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     5 5
     ...
     n n
     ```
   - The distances calculated from the points include:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\)
     - \(|2-1| + |4-2| = 3\)
     - \(|4-1| + |4-1| = 6\)
     - \(|5-1| + |5-1| = 8\)
     - \(|n-1| + |n-1| = 2(n-1)\)
   - But the program does not ensure that all possible Manhattan distances between the points are covered, especially for larger \(n\).

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen in such a way that they cover the maximum range of Manhattan distances. The current program does not achieve this for \(n > 3\).

Correctness: **False**
