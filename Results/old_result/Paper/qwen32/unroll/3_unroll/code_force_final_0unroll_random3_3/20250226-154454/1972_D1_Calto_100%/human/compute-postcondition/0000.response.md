In the given `while` loop, the loop condition is `while b:`. In Python, this loop will execute as long as `b` is truthy. Since `b` is described as a positive integer, it is already truthy and the loop can execute without any adjustments to `b`.

Therefore, no changes are needed to the state of `b` for the loop to execute the first time. The state of `a` does not affect the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers**
