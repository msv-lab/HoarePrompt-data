Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it constructs and prints a string of lowercase Latin letters. The string is generated based on a list of integers, mapping each integer to a corresponding letter and incrementing a count to ensure each letter is unique within the constraints of the problem.**
