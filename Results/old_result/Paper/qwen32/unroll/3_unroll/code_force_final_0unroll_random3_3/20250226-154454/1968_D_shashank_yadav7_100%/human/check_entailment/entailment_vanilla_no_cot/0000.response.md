Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game after `k` turns. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. It attempts to update the scores in a loop that runs `n` times, but this is not necessary and incorrect. The loop should run `k` times, not `n` times. Additionally, the way scores are updated in the loop is incorrect. The program should keep adding the value of `a` at the current position to the player's score on each turn.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**: The program incorrectly handles the moves of Bodya and Sasha. It should either stay at the current position or move to `p_x`. However, the program does not provide the players with a choice; it simply moves them to `p_x` on each turn, which is not what the problem statement describes.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Score**: The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible score for each player by multiplying the value at the current position by the remaining turns. This is incorrect because the players can choose to stay at their current position, which might yield a higher score than moving.

To correct the program, we need to simulate the game for `k` turns, allowing each player to either stay or move to `p_x` on each turn, and correctly calculate their scores. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the scores of Bodya and Sasha based on the values at their current positions, and then moves them to `p_x` on each turn. After `k` turns, it compares the scores to determine the winner.
