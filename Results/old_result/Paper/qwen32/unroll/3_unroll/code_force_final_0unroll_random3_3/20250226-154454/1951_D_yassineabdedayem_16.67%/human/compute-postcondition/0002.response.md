To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given code and understand what it does with the input values `n` and `k` for each test case.

The code performs the following steps for each test case:
1. It reads `n` and `k` from the input.
2. It initializes `rep` (a counter to prevent infinite loops), `number` (to store intermediate results), and `tab` (a list to store the sequence of numbers).
3. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
4. Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n // k` and `k`.
5. Depending on the conditions, it updates `number`, `k`, `tab`, and `n`.
6. After the loop, it checks if `k` is zero. If it is, it prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and the elements of `tab`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can describe the output state in a general form. After all iterations of the loop, the state will depend on the final values of `k` and the contents of `tab` for each test case.

Given the structure of the loop, the output state can be described as follows:
- For each test case, `k` will either be reduced to zero or remain greater than zero.
- If `k` is reduced to zero, `tab` will contain a sequence of numbers that were used to reduce `k` to zero.
- If `k` is not reduced to zero, `tab` will contain the sequence of numbers up to the point where the loop terminated.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **For each test case, if `k` is reduced to zero, the output will be 'YES', followed by the length of the sequence `tab` and the sequence itself. If `k` is not reduced to zero, the output will be 'NO'.**
