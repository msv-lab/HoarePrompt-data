Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid of arrows. Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Initial Check for `b[-2] != '>'`**:
   - The code checks if the second last character of the second row (`b[-2]`) is not `>`. If it is not, it immediately prints "NO". This is incorrect because the robot can still reach (2, n) even if `b[-2]` is not `>`. For example, if the robot can move from (1, n-1) to (2, n-1) and then to (2, n), the condition `b[-2] != '>'` should not be the sole deciding factor.

2. **Handling `n == 1`**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by printing "YES". However, this case is trivial and should be handled correctly, which it does.

3. **Checking Alternating Columns**:
   - The code then checks if all arrows in even-indexed columns of the second row (`b[k]`) are `>`. If not, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the movement in the first row and the possibility of moving down from the first row to the second row.
   - After that, it checks if all arrows in odd-indexed columns of the first row (`a[k]`) are `>`. If not, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This logic is also flawed for the same reason.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - The code finally prints "YES" if `no_path` remains `True` after the above checks, otherwise it prints "NO". This logic is incorrect because the conditions used to set `no_path` are not comprehensive enough to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```
- For this input, the robot can start at (1, 1), move right to (1, 2), move down to (2, 2), move right to (2, 3), move down to (1, 3), move right to (1, 4), and finally move down to (2, 4). Therefore, the correct output should be "YES".
- However, the provided code will print "NO" because it will set `no_path` to `True` during the first loop (since `b[0]` is not `>`) and then set it to `False` during the second loop (since `a[1]` is not `>`).

Thus, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
