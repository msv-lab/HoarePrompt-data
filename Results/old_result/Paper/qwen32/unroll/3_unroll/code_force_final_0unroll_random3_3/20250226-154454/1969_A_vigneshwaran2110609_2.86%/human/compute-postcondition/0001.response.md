The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting these variables. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate at least one iteration if `n` is 1 or more. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer read from the input; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1. The value of `t` and the list `p` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`**
