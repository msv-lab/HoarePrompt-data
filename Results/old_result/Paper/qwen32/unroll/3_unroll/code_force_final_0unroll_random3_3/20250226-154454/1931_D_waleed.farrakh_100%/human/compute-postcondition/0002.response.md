Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the length of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `input` is the content read from standard input; `data` is a list where each element is a line from the input content; `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, which is the value of the first element in `data`.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which represents the number of test cases. All other variables remain unchanged.
