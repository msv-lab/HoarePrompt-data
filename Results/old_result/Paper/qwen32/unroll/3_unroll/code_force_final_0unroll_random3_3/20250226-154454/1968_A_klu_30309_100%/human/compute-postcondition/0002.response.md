To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the behavior of the nested loop and its effect on the `results` list.

The outer loop iterates over each integer `x` in the `test_cases` list. For each `x`, the inner loop starts from `x-1` and decrements `y` down to `1`. The goal is to find the largest `y` such that the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is maximized. However, the `break` statement inside the inner loop means that the loop terminates after the first iteration, implying that `best_y` will always be `x-1` (the first value of `y` in the inner loop).

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation:
1. The outer loop iterates over each `x` in `test_cases`.
2. For each `x`, the inner loop starts with `y = x-1`.
3. The GCD of `x` and `y` is calculated.
4. The sum of `y` and the GCD is computed and compared to `max_sum`. Since `max_sum` is initially `0`, this sum will always be greater.
5. `max_sum` is updated, and `best_y` is set to `y`.
6. The `break` statement exits the inner loop immediately after the first iteration.
7. `best_y` (which is `x-1`) is appended to the `results` list.

Given this behavior, the `results` list will contain `x-1` for each `x` in `test_cases`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`results` is a list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `test_cases`.**
