Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their choice of living on that side. The position `i` should be as close to the middle of the village as possible, and if there are multiple such positions, the smallest one should be chosen.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.

#### `func_1()` Breakdown:
1. **Input Reading**: Reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Constructs a list `S` where `S[i]` is a tuple `(x, y)` representing the number of '0's and '1's in the first `i` houses. This is done using a running total.
3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - Iterates over all possible positions `i` from `0` to `n`.
   - For each position `i`, calculates the number of '0's (`left`) and '1's (`right`) on the left and right sides of the road, respectively.
   - Checks if the conditions are met: at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - If the conditions are met and the current position is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position, it updates the answer.
4. **Output**: Prints the optimal position `i`.

#### Correctness Check:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array `S` is correctly built to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's.
2. **Condition Check**: The conditions to check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied are correctly implemented using the ceiling function logic.
3. **Optimal Position Selection**: The program correctly selects the position `i` that is closest to the middle of the village, and in case of a tie, it selects the smaller one.
4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given problem statement. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
