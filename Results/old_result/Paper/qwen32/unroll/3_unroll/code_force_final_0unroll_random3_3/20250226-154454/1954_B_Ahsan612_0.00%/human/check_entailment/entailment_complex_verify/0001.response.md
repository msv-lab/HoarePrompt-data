Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail, using the annotated code to validate the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements using the specified operation. The key is to identify the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements in the array. If the array consists of only one segment, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and the answer should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program processes each test case as follows:
1. **Initialization**: It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity.
2. **Iteration**: It iterates through the array, counting consecutive identical elements.
3. **Update `minn`**: When a different element is encountered, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between the current `minn` and `same`, then resets `same` to 1.
4. **Final Update**: After the loop, it updates `minn` once more to ensure the last segment is considered.
5. **Output**: If `minn` is still infinity (indicating a single segment), it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

### Annotations and Validation:
The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points:
- **Initialization**: `same` starts at 1, `num` is the first element, and `minn` is set to infinity.
- **Loop**: The loop correctly counts consecutive identical elements and updates `minn` when a different element is encountered.
- **Final Update**: The final update ensures the last segment is considered.
- **Output**: The output logic is correct based on the value of `minn`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array**: The program correctly handles single-element arrays by setting `minn` to 1 and then updating it to infinity, resulting in an output of `-1`.
- **Uniform Array**: If the array consists of identical elements, `minn` remains infinity, and the program outputs `-1`.
- **Multiple Segments**: The program correctly identifies the smallest segment and outputs its length.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make a beautiful array non-beautiful. It handles all edge cases as described and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
