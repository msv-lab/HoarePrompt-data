The code snippet `m = int(input())` assigns the value of `m` to be the integer conversion of an input provided by the user. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, and `mi` are already defined with specific conditions, and `m` is not defined until this input is taken. Therefore, the value of `m` will be whatever integer the user inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is the integer input by the user.**
