The code sorts the list `a` in descending order. The values of `n`, `counter`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The list `a` will now have its elements ordered from the largest to the smallest.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that stores the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`; `cur` is 0.**
