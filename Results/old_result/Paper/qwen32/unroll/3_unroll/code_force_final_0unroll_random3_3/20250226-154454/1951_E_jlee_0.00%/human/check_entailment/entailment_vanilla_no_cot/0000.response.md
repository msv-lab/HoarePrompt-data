Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings. Specifically, the logic for determining whether a partition is possible and how to construct such a partition is flawed. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Palindromic Strings**: The program does not correctly identify when a string is a palindrome and attempts to partition it into non-palindromic substrings. For example, in the case where the string is a palindrome, the program should check for the possibility of partitioning it into two or more non-palindromic substrings, but the current logic does not cover all such cases.

2. **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings is not robust. The program does not ensure that each substring is non-palindromic, especially in cases where the string contains repeated characters or is a palindrome.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle certain edge cases properly, such as strings with repeated characters where the middle character is different, or strings that are palindromes with a single character in the middle.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        s = list(string)
        n = len(s)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to find a partition
        found_partition = False
        for j in range(1, n):
            if not is_palindrome(string[:j]) and not is_palindrome(string[j:]):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                found_partition = True
                break
        
        if not found_partition:
            # Check if the whole string is a palindrome
            if not is_palindrome(string):
                print('YES')
                print(1)
                print(string)
                continue
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks for the possibility of partitioning the string into two non-palindromic substrings, and if not, checks if the whole string is non-palindromic. If neither condition is met, it correctly outputs "NO".
