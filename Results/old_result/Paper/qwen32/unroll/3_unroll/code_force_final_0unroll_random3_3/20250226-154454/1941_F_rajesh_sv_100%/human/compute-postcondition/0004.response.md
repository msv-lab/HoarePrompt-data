Functionality: **The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It performs a series of operations based on the number of test cases, which is determined by the value returned from `func_3()`. The function iterates through each test case by calling `func_6()` for each one. After completing the iterations, the function does not return any specific value or modify the input parameters.**
