Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he has at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') for each of the `m` rounds. The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the given problems. It then calculates the total number of additional problems needed by checking if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and summing up the differences.

However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. **Default Value Function**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with `default_value`, but there is no function or value defined with this name. It should be initialized with `int` or a lambda function that returns 0, like `defaultdict(int)` or `defaultdict(lambda: 0)`.
2. **Logic Error**: The current logic adds `m - d[val]` to `ans` for every difficulty level that has a count less than or equal to `m`. This is incorrect because it should only add `m - d[val]` if `d[val]` is less than `m`, not less than or equal to `m`. If `d[val]` is equal to `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.
3. **Unnecessary Function**: The function `func_1` is defined but never used and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':  # Ensure all difficulty levels are checked
        if d[val] < m:  # Only add if less than m
            ans = ans + m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

Since the original program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
