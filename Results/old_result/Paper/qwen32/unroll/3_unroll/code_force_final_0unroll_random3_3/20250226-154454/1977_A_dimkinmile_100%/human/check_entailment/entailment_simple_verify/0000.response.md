Let's carefully evaluate the program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the annotated code.

### Problem Analysis
The problem describes a scenario where Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube from a tower in each move. We need to determine if it's possible for the tower to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Points
1. **Addition and Removal**: Nikita can add or remove one cube per move.
2. **Parity of Moves**: The key insight here is that if `n - m` is even, Nikita can balance the moves by pairing additions and removals to end up with `m` cubes. If `n - m` is odd, there will be one unpaired move, which means the final number of cubes will not be `m`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Annotated Code Review
The annotations confirm that the program correctly checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative. If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Original Assessment Review
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect due to a specific counterexample where `n` is odd and `m` is 0. Let's analyze this case:

- **Counterexample**: `n = 1`, `m = 0`
  - The program checks `(1 - 0) % 2 == 0` and `1 - 0 >= 0`, both of which are true.
  - The program prints "Yes".
  - **Expected Output**: "No" because if `n` is odd and `m` is 0, one unpaired move will leave one cube in the tower.

### Re-evaluation
The original assessment is correct in identifying this specific case. However, let's verify the general logic:

1. **Case 1: n < m**
   - If `n < m`, it's impossible to reach `m` cubes with `n` moves. The condition `n - m >= 0` will be false, correctly resulting in "No".

2. **Case 2: n >= m**
   - If `n >= m`, the difference `n - m` represents the surplus moves. If `n - m` is even, Nikita can balance the moves to end up with `m` cubes. If `n - m` is odd, one unpaired move will leave the tower with a different number of cubes, resulting in "No".

### Final Assessment
The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the specific case where `n` is odd and `m` is 0. The original assessment correctly identifies this flaw.

### Conclusion
Final: **False**
