The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
os.system('cls')
```

This line of code clears the console screen. It does not affect the values of the variables `t` or `n` in any way. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50.**
