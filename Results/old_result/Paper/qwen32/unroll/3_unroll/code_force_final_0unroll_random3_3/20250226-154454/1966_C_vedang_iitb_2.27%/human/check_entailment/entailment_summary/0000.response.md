### Reasoning:

Let's analyze each function and see if they meet the requirements of the game described in the problem.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- **Purpose**: To transform the list of pile sizes into a new list that represents the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes in ascending order.
- **Execution Summary**: The function first removes duplicates from the list and sorts the remaining unique values. Then, it calculates the differences between consecutive values in this sorted list.
- **Issue**: The transformation performed by `func_1` does not align with the game rules or the way the game's outcome should be determined. The game's outcome should be based on the pile sizes directly, not on the differences between unique pile sizes. The transformation does not provide any meaningful information for determining the winner based on the game rules.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`
- **Purpose**: To determine the winner of the game given the transformed list of pile sizes and the number of piles.
- **Execution Summary**: The function uses recursion to determine if the current player can force a win. It handles three cases:
  1. If there's only one pile, the current player wins.
  2. If there are two piles, the current player wins if the first pile size is even.
  3. For more than two piles, it recursively checks the outcome of the game without the first pile.
- **Issue**: The function's logic is based on the transformed list from `func_1`, which is not correctly representing the game state. Therefore, the recursive logic and conditions are not accurate for determining the game's outcome.

### Conclusion:
The functions do not correctly implement the game's rules and logic. The transformation performed by `func_1` is not meaningful for the game, and `func_2` relies on an incorrect representation of the game state.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
