To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: An integer between 1 and 3 Â· 10^5, inclusive.
2. **`a`**: A list of unique integers sorted in descending order.
3. **`counter`**: A `Counter` object where each element's count from `a` is decremented by 1.
4. **`cur`**: Initialized to 0.
5. **`cnt`**: Initialized to 0.
6. **`ans`**: A list of `n` elements, initially including all elements from `a` and additional elements inserted in descending order to reach the length `n`.

### Analysis:
- The list `ans` is constructed to have `n` elements. It starts with all elements from the list `a` and then additional elements are inserted in descending order to reach the required length `n`.
- Since `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, and `counter` decrements each element's count by 1, this suggests that each element in `a` is intended to appear one less time in `ans` than it appears in `a` (if it appears at all after decrementing).
- However, the description of `ans` indicates that it is filled to a length of `n` with elements from `a` and additional elements in descending order. This means that after accounting for the decremented counts, if `ans` is still not of length `n`, additional elements from `a` (or potentially other elements) are added to reach `n` elements in total.
- The `*ans` in the `print` statement unpacks the list `ans` and prints its elements separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans`, which contains `n` elements in total, starting with the elements of `a` (with their counts adjusted by the `counter`), and additional elements in descending order if necessary to reach the length `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **[elements of ans separated by spaces] (where ans is a list of n elements constructed from the list a and additional elements in descending order to reach the length n)**
