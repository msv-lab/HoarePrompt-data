You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and the next `n` elements are the integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from the start of the list `a` up to the `i`-th element, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 otherwise.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 0, a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (where a[i] is the cumulative sum of a[0] to a[i])
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: a sequence of q lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition for each query.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `c` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list `c` contains `n` integers, each greater than 0 and up to 10^9. For each query, it accepts two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range within the list `c`. The function processes these queries and returns the sum of the elements in the list `c` for each specified range `[l_i, r_i]`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
