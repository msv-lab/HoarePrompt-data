You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of `n` elements, each equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` is reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for each of the `n` iterations.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first `n-1` elements of `nums` are all equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. Let's analyze why.

The goal is to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

The program `func_1` attempts to achieve this by setting each element of the sequence to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` (which is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all bits set to 1) and then adjusting the last element to make the sum equal to `k`. 

However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Bitwise OR Maximization**: The program does not consider how the bitwise OR of the numbers would be maximized. Setting all numbers to the same value with the same number of bits set to 1 does not guarantee that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of 1s. For example, if `k = 5` and `n = 2`, the correct sequence would be `[1, 4]` or `[4, 1]` because `1 | 4 = 5` which is `(101)_2` with 2 ones, whereas `(1 << 5.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is `3` and `[3, 2]` would give `3 | 2 = (11)_2` with only 2 ones, but `[1, 4]` is better because it uses the available bits more effectively.

2. **Handling of Remaining Sum**: The program adjusts the last element to make the sum equal to `k`, but this adjustment might not be optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

A correct approach would involve distributing the sum `k` among the `n` integers in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. One possible strategy is to use the smallest powers of 2 to sum up to `k` and distribute them among the `n` integers.

For example, to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR for `k = 5` and `n = 2`, we can use the numbers `1` and `4` (which are `1` and `100` in binary, respectively), resulting in `1 | 4 = 5` which is `(101)_2` with 2 ones.

Therefore, the provided program does not guarantee the correct solution and is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
