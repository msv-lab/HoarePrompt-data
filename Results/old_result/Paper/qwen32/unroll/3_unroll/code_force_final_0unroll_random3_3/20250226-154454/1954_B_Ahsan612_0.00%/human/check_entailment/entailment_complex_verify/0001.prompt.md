You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: a series of integers, each representing the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements in the list `a`. If no such subarray exists, it prints `-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.

### Key Points:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing the specified operation.
2. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array consists of identical elements, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer should be `-1`.
   - If there are segments of different elements, the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the smallest segment.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Iterating through each test case.
2. For each array, it counts the length of consecutive segments of identical elements.
3. It keeps track of the smallest segment length (`minn`).
4. If the smallest segment length is infinite (i.e., the array has only one segment of identical elements), it outputs `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it outputs the smallest segment length.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**: The program does not handle the case where the array has only one element correctly. It should output `-1` for such arrays since removing the single element would result in an empty array, which is trivially beautiful.
2. **Logic for Determining `minn`**: The logic for determining the smallest segment length is correct, but it needs to handle the edge case of single-element arrays explicitly.
3. **Initialization of `minn`**: The initialization of `minn` to `inf` is correct, but the program should ensure that it correctly updates `minn` for all segments.

### Correctness:
The provided program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with handling single-element arrays. However, given the problem constraints and the fact that the problem guarantees that the input arrays are beautiful, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs except single-element arrays, which are already handled correctly by the program's logic. 

Since the problem specifies that the input arrays are beautiful and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\), the program will work correctly for all valid inputs as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
