You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        m = min(a)
        ans = 0
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            for i in range(n):
                a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
                k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            ans = a[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `a`. The result is printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score based on the problem description. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of distinct types of cards) and `k` (number of coins).
   - It then reads the list `a` which contains the initial counts of each card type.

2. **Finding the Minimum Count `m`:**
   - The program calculates `m`, which is the minimum count of any card type in the list `a`.

3. **Calculating the Answer `ans` if `k >= n * m`:**
   - If the number of coins `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, the program sets `ans` to `n!` (n factorial), which is the number of permutations of `n` distinct items.
   - This part seems correct for the scenario where we can make all `n` card types have at least `m` cards and still have enough coins left to make all card types have equal counts.

4. **Adjusting Counts if `k < n * m`:**
   - If `k` is less than `n * m`, the program attempts to distribute the coins to increase the counts of the card types.
   - The logic in this part seems flawed. Specifically, the calculation `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` and the subsequent decrement of `k` do not correctly simulate the process of buying cards to maximize the score.

5. **Calculating the Answer `ans` from Adjusted Counts:**
   - The program then calculates `ans` as the product of the differences between consecutive adjusted counts, starting from `a[0]`.
   - This part of the logic is also incorrect because it does not correctly compute the number of valid permutations of length `n` from the adjusted counts.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
1 1 1
```
- Here, `n = 3` and `k = 3`.
- The initial counts are `a = [1, 1, 1]`.
- The minimum count `m` is `1`.
- Since `k < n * m` (3 < 3), the program enters the else block.
- The program then attempts to distribute the coins, but the logic is flawed.
- The correct approach would be to distribute the coins to make the counts as equal as possible and then calculate the number of valid permutations.

The correct maximum score for this case should be `2` (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]` contains two valid permutations `[1, 2, 3]`), but the program will likely output an incorrect value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least this test case.
