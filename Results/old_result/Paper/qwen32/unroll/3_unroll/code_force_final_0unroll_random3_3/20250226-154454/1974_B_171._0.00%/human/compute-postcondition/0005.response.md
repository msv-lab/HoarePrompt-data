Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length between 1 and 200,000. It returns a decoded string where each character in the `encoded` string has been replaced by its corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' as defined in a `mapping` dictionary.**
