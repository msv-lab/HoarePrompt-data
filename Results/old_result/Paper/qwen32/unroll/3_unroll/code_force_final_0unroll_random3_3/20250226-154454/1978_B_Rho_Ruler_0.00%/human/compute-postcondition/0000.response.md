The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code. The initial conditions for `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `ans` is 0.**
