Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, and `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `small_element` is now `left + 1`, while the values of `left`, `right`, and `clique` remain unchanged.
