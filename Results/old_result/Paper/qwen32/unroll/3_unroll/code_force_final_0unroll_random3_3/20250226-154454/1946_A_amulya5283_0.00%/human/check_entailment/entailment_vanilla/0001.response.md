Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The median is defined as the middle element in a sorted array. For an even number of elements, it's the element at the \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\) position.

### Solution Analysis
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the array is sorted.
3. **Finding the Median**: The median is identified as the element at the \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\) position in the sorted array.
4. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap to track the elements starting from the median position and onward.
5. **Incrementing Elements**: The program repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The number of such operations is counted as the result.

### Correctness Analysis
The key part of the solution that needs verification is the logic for incrementing elements to increase the median. The program uses a heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest element that is part of the median determination.

- **Heap Initialization**: The heap is initialized with elements starting from the median position. This ensures that only the relevant elements (those that could affect the median) are considered.
- **Incrementing Elements**: By repeatedly incrementing the smallest element in this heap, the program ensures that the median is increased in the minimum number of operations. This is because the smallest element is the one that can be increased with the least impact on the number of operations.

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find and increment the elements that affect the median. The use of a heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
