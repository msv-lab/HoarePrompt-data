Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, each test case containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix `a`. The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**

In simpler terms: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer input by the user. The conditions regarding the size of the matrix `n` and the total sum of `n^2` across all test cases remain unchanged.
