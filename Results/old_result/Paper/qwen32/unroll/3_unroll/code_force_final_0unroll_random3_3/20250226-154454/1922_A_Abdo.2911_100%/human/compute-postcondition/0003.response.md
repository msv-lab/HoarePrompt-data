Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates based on predefined conditions involving an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it considers three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) lowercase Latin letters. The function returns an output for each test case based on the comparison or processing of these strings.**
