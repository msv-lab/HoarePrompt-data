Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player, respectively. It also accepts a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function performs some operations based on these inputs but does not return any value (returns `None`).**
