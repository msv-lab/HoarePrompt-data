Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the Nim game variant described. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly simulate the game rules or determine the winner based on optimal play.

Here's a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- In this case, there are 4 piles with 1 stone each.
- Alice can only choose `k = 1` and will remove 1 stone from each pile, making all piles empty.
- Since Alice made the last move and emptied all piles, Bob is unable to make a move and loses.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
Alice
```

**Explanation of the Actual Output:**
- The program's logic incorrectly determines that Alice wins in this scenario.
- The issue lies in the logic of the function `func_1`, which does not correctly simulate the game rules or determine the winner based on optimal play.

The program seems to be making incorrect assumptions about the game state and the conditions under which each player wins. It does not correctly handle cases where the piles have the same number of stones or where the smallest pile has more than one stone.

To correctly determine the winner, the program should simulate the game based on the rules provided and determine the winner based on optimal play. The current implementation does not do this correctly and thus fails for certain inputs.
