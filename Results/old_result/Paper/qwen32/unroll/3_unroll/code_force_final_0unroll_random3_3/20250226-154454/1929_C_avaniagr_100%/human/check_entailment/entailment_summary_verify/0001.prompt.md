You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition involving these integers is met and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The final state of the program is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one for each test case, indicating whether the condition is satisfied based on the input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Sasha aims to determine if he can guarantee that he will eventually have at least `n` coins for any `n` by placing bets under the given rules. The key points are:
1. If he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
2. If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
3. He can't lose more than `x` times in a row.
4. The bet amount `y` must be a positive integer and can't exceed his current number of coins.

### Strategy:
To ensure Sasha can achieve any number of coins, he needs to be able to recover from any sequence of losses within the `x` consecutive loss limit and keep increasing his coins.

### Conditions for "YES":
1. If `x < k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to ensure he can recover from the worst-case scenario of `x` losses in a row.
2. If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins because the worst-case scenario requires one more coin to start the next cycle after `x` losses.
3. If `x > k - 1`, the logic is more complex. We need to calculate the minimum coins required to ensure Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario and keep increasing his coins. The provided code attempts this by iteratively calculating the required coins.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to implement the above logic:
- It first checks if `x < k - 1` and whether Sasha has enough coins (`a >= x + 1`).
- It then checks if `x == k - 1` and whether Sasha has enough coins (`a >= x + 2`).
- For `x > k - 1`, it calculates the minimum coins required through an iterative process.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the first test case:
- `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
  - Since `x < k - 1` is false and `x == k - 1` is true, it checks if `a >= x + 2` which is `7 >= 3`. This is true, so the output is "YES".

Let's verify the second test case:
- `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
  - Since `x < k - 1` is false and `x == k - 1` is true, it checks if `a >= x + 2` which is `1 >= 3`. This is false, so the output is "NO".

The provided code seems to implement the correct logic based on the problem description and the examples given. However, we need to ensure that the logic for `x > k - 1` is correct and handles all cases properly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly handle the conditions and logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, it seems to be correct.
