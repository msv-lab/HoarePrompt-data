### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the maximum balance, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of n sub-problems that sum up to x. The optimal strategy is to find the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n, or the largest quotient x // i that is less than or equal to n.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, x (the total difficulty) and n (the number of sub-problems).

2. **Finding Divisors**: The program iterates through all possible divisors of x up to the integer square root of x. For each divisor i:
   - If i is a divisor of x (i.e., `x % i == 0`), it checks if n is less than or equal to x // i. If true, it updates the maximum balance (ans) with the maximum of the current ans and i.
   - It also checks if n is less than or equal to i. If true, it updates the maximum balance (ans) with the maximum of the current ans and x // i.

3. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the maximum balance found.

Let's verify the logic with the example test cases:

- **First Test Case (x = 10, n = 3)**:
  - Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
  - x // 1 = 10, x // 2 = 5, x // 5 = 2, x // 10 = 1.
  - Checking the conditions:
    - For i = 1: n (3) is not less than or equal to x // 1 (10) or i (1).
    - For i = 2: n (3) is not less than or equal to x // 2 (5) but is less than or equal to i (2).
    - For i = 5: n (3) is less than or equal to x // 5 (2) but not less than or equal to i (5).
    - For i = 10: n (3) is less than or equal to x // 10 (1) but not less than or equal to i (10).
  - The maximum balance is 2.

- **Second Test Case (x = 5, n = 5)**:
  - Divisors of 5 are 1, 5.
  - x // 1 = 5, x // 5 = 1.
  - Checking the conditions:
    - For i = 1: n (5) is less than or equal to x // 1 (5) and i (1).
    - For i = 5: n (5) is less than or equal to x // 5 (1) but not less than or equal to i (5).
  - The maximum balance is 1.

- **Third Test Case (x = 420, n = 69)**:
  - Divisors of 420 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420.
  - Checking the conditions:
    - For i = 6: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 6 (70) or i (6).
    - For i = 7: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 7 (60) or i (7).
    - For i = 10: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 10 (42) or i (10).
    - For i = 12: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 12 (35) or i (12).
    - For i = 14: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 14 (30) or i (14).
    - For i = 15: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 15 (28) or i (15).
    - For i = 20: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 20 (21) or i (20).
    - For i = 21: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 21 (20) or i (21).
    - For i = 28: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 28 (15) or i (28).
    - For i = 30: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 30 (14) or i (30).
    - For i = 35: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 35 (12) or i (35).
    - For i = 42: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 42 (10) or i (42).
    - For i = 60: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 60 (7) or i (60).
    - For i = 70: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 70 (6) or i (70).
    - For i = 84: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 84 (5) or i (84).
    - For i = 105: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 105 (4) or i (105).
    - For i = 140: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 140 (3) or i (140).
    - For i = 210: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 210 (2) or i (210).
    - For i = 420: n (69) is not less than or equal to x // 420 (1) or i (420).
  - The maximum balance is 6.

The program correctly computes the maximum balance for each test case based on the described logic.
