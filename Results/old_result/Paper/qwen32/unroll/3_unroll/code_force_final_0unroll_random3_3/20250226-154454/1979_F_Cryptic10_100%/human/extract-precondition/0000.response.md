Precondition: **The function `func()` is designed to interactively determine a Hamiltonian path in a graph. The graph starts as a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and then has exactly (n - 2) edges removed. The function can make at most `n` queries of the form "? d" to gather information about the graph's structure, where `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1). The function should output a Hamiltonian path in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n" after processing the queries. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
