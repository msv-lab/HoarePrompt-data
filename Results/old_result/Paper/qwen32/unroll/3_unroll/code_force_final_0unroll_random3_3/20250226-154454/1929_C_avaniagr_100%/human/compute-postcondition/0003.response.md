Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition involving these integers is met and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The final state of the program is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one for each test case, indicating whether the condition is satisfied based on the input values.**
