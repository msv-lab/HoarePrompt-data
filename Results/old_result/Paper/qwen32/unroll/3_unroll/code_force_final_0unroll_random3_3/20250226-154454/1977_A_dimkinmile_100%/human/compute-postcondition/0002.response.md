The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Yes'. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- The difference `n - m` is even and non-negative.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
