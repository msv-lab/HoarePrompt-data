The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which are then assigned to the variable `nums`. The initial state specifies that `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, and `N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input. After executing the code snippet, `nums` will hold the integers from the input line.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the input line.**
