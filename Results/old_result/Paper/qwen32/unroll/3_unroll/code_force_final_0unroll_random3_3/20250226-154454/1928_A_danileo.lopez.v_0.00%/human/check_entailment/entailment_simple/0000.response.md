Reasoning:  
The problem states that Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then combine them in a way that forms a new rectangle with different dimensions. The key insight is that this is only possible if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle (a or b) is even. If both dimensions are odd, then cutting the rectangle will always result in smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even (`a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`). If this condition is true, it prints "Yes", indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints "No".

This matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement and the example cases provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
