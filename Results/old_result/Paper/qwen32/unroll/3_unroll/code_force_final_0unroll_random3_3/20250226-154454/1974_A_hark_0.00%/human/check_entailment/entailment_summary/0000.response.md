### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 application icons and `y` number of 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid.

#### Analysis of Functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the minimum of two integers. However, it is not used anywhere in the provided code, so it does not impact the correctness of the program.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes a single test case by reading two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - It calculates the minimum number of screens required based on the following logic:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
       - It then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The formula used is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, which seems incorrect.
       - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the remaining space divided by 15, plus 1.
       - The result is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the ceiling of `y / 2`.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the ceiling of `x / 15`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it returns 0.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining space and the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons seems flawed. Specifically, the formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it doesn't accurately represent the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It iterates `t` times and calls `func_2` for each test case to process the input and print the result.

### Conclusion:
The main issue lies in the logic of `func_2` for calculating the number of screens required when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The formula used to calculate the remaining space and the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
