In the given task, the for loop iterates over each character in the string `encoded`. To ensure that the loop can execute, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `char`. However, the loop's execution depends on the `encoded` string itself. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `mapping` is an empty dictionary.
- `decoded` is an empty list.

The loop will execute if `encoded` has at least one character. Therefore, we need to ensure that `encoded` is not an empty string.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` such that `n` is at least 1, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list**.
