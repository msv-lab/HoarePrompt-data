Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The program currently only calculates combinations of sticks that have the same length and does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which is necessary to form a non-degenerate triangle.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that for any three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\), the following conditions must be met to form a non-degenerate triangle:

\[2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}\]
\[2^{a_i} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_j}\]
\[2^{a_j} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_i}\]

Given the constraints, an efficient approach would involve sorting the lengths and using a two-pointer technique to count valid triplets. The provided program does not address these conditions and hence is incorrect.
