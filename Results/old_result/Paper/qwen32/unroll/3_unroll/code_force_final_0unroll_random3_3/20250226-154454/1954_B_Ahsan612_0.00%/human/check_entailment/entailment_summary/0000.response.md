### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements in the list `a`. However, this approach does not correctly address the problem's requirement.

The problem asks for the minimum number of elements to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i - 1] = a[i + 1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i - 1]`.

The provided program calculates the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements, which is not directly related to determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program does not account for how elements can be replaced based on the given operation.

For example, in the fourth test case:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The program would output `3` because the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements is `3` (the subarrays `[3, 3, 3]` appear twice). However, the correct answer is `3` because we can remove the first three elements to form the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for the specific replacement operation described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
