You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        print(*s)
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):
            if flag and s[i] == '0':
                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes each of the `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `x`. For each `x`, it performs a series of transformations on its binary representation, ultimately printing the modified binary string and its length after all transformations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Array Construction**:
   - The program initializes the array `s` by converting the binary representation of `x` into a list of '1's and '0's. This is incorrect because the problem description specifies that the array elements can be 1, 0, or -1, and that no two consecutive elements can be non-zero.
   - The program then attempts to modify the array to meet the constraints, but it does so in a way that does not guarantee correctness for all possible values of `x`.

2. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
   - The program tries to replace consecutive '1's with '-1' and '0' to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero. However, this logic is flawed and does not always produce a valid array for all values of `x`.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the length of the array and the array itself, but the array elements are not correctly adjusted to meet the problem constraints.

To illustrate the issue, consider the test case `x = 15`. The binary representation of 15 is `1111`, and the program might incorrectly handle this by converting it to an array of '1's and then attempting to adjust it. However, a valid array for `x = 15` should be `[-1, 0, -1, 0, 1]`, which satisfies all the conditions.

Here is an example of how the program might fail for `x = 15`:

- The initial array `s` would be `['1', '1', '1', '1']`.
- The program then attempts to adjust this array to avoid consecutive non-zero elements, but it might not produce a valid array like `[-1, 0, -1, 0, 1]`.

Thus, the program does not correctly generate the required array for all possible values of `x`, and therefore, it is incorrect.
