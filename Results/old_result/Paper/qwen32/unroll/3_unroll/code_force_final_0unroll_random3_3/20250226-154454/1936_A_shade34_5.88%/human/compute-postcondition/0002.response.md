Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any input arguments. It receives the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of a hidden permutation. The function can query up to 3n times to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements from the permutation. It outputs the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices for each test case.**
