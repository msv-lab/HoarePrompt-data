Reasoning:  
The provided program is tasked with finding an arrangement of `n` points on an `n x n` grid that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points. However, the given implementation does not achieve this goal for all values of `n`.

Let's break down the provided program and see why it is incorrect for `n > 2`:

1. For `n = 2`, the program correctly outputs two points: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. This results in only two distinct Manhattan distances: `0` (distance from a point to itself) and `1` (distance between the two points), which is optimal for `n = 2`.

2. For `n > 2`, the program outputs the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and then `(i, i)` for `i` from `3` to `n`. The points `(i, i)` form the main diagonal of the grid starting from `(3, 3)` to `(n, n)`. 

3. However, this arrangement does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, for `n = 3`, the points `(2, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 1)` would yield the distinct distances `{0, 1, 2, 3}`, which is optimal. The provided program instead yields `{0, 1, 2}`, missing the distance `3`.

4. Similarly, for `n = 4`, the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 3)`, and `(4, 4)` do not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. A better arrangement could be `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(4, 3)`, and `(4, 4)` which yields `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.

5. The arrangement needs to be carefully chosen to ensure that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances are achieved. The provided solution does not guarantee this for all `n`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
