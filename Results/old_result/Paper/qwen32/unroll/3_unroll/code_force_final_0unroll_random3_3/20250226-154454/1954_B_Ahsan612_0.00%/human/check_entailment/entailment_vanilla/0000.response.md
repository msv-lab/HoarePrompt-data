Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if, by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1` and `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`), we can replace `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` until all elements in the array are the same.

### Key Observations

1. **Beautiful Array Characteristics**:
   - A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements by repeated operations.
   - The operations only affect the middle elements of sequences of identical elements.

2. **Objective**:
   - Find the minimum number of elements to remove such that the array can no longer be transformed into an array of all identical elements through the specified operations.
   - If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, return `-1`.

3. **Approach**:
   - The minimum number of elements that need to be removed corresponds to the length of the shortest contiguous subsequence of identical elements in the array.
   - If all elements are identical, the array is already in its simplest beautiful form, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements. Hence, the answer should be `-1` in this case.
   - If there are multiple subsequences of identical elements, the answer is the length of the shortest one.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` keeps track of the length of the current contiguous sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` stores the current element being counted.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` to track the minimum length of such sequences.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, increment `same`.
   - If the current element is different:
     - Update `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Reset `same` to `1` and update `num` to the current element.
   - The loop continues until all elements are processed.

3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time to ensure the last sequence is considered.

4. **Output**:
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means there was only one element in the array, which is already the simplest beautiful form, so the output is `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the output is the value of `minn`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The logic for handling the special case where the array has only one element is also correctly implemented.

Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
