#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: a series of integers, each representing the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements in the list `a`. If no such subarray exists, it prints `-1`.
