Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic for counting consecutive elements and finding the minimum segment to remove is flawed. Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. The program only counts the length of consecutive segments of the same number but does not correctly identify the segments that can be removed to break the "beautiful" property.
2. The program does not account for the situation where the array consists of alternating segments or has more complex patterns that require more sophisticated analysis to determine the minimum removal.
3. The check `if minn == inf` is incorrect because `minn` is initialized to `inf` and will always be less than `inf` after processing the array unless the array is empty, which is not a valid case according to the problem constraints.

To solve the problem correctly, a more detailed analysis of the array structure is needed. For example, one approach could involve:
- Identifying segments of the array where the "beautiful" property can be maintained.
- Calculating the cost (number of removals) to break the "beautiful" property by removing elements from these segments.
- Determining the minimum cost across all possible removals.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removal
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # If the array has two elements, it is also trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removal
        if n == 2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove
        min_removals = n  # Initialize to the maximum possible removals (whole array)
        
        # Iterate through the array to find segments that can be removed
        i = 1
        while i < n - 1:
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                # We can try to remove ar[i]
                # Calculate the cost of removing ar[i]
                # This is the length of the segment that includes ar[i]
                # We need to find the length of the segment that includes ar[i]
                left = i - 1
                right = i + 1
                while left > 0 and ar[left - 1] == ar[left]:
                    left -= 1
                while right < n - 1 and ar[right + 1] == ar[right]:
                    right += 1
                # The segment length is (right - left + 1), and we need to remove (right - left - 1) elements to break the segment
                min_removals = min(min_removals, right - left - 1)
                i = right  # Move i to the end of the current segment
            else:
                i += 1
        
        # If min_removals is still n, it means we could not find a valid segment to remove
        if min_removals == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_removals)

func()
```

This corrected program should properly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.
