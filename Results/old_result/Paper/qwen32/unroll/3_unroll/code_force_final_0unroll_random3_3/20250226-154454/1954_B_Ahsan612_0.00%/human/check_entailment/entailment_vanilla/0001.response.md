Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.

### Key Points:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing the specified operation.
2. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array consists of identical elements, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer should be `-1`.
   - If there are segments of different elements, the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the smallest segment.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Iterating through each test case.
2. For each array, it counts the length of consecutive segments of identical elements.
3. It keeps track of the smallest segment length (`minn`).
4. If the smallest segment length is infinite (i.e., the array has only one segment of identical elements), it outputs `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it outputs the smallest segment length.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**: The program does not handle the case where the array has only one element correctly. It should output `-1` for such arrays since removing the single element would result in an empty array, which is trivially beautiful.
2. **Logic for Determining `minn`**: The logic for determining the smallest segment length is correct, but it needs to handle the edge case of single-element arrays explicitly.
3. **Initialization of `minn`**: The initialization of `minn` to `inf` is correct, but the program should ensure that it correctly updates `minn` for all segments.

### Correctness:
The provided program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with handling single-element arrays. However, given the problem constraints and the fact that the problem guarantees that the input arrays are beautiful, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs except single-element arrays, which are already handled correctly by the program's logic. 

Since the problem specifies that the input arrays are beautiful and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\), the program will work correctly for all valid inputs as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
