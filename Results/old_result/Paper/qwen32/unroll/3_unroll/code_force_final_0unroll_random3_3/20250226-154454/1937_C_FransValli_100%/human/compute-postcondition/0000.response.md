In the provided task, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustment related to the loop head itself. However, we need to ensure that the input is provided correctly for the loop to execute the intended number of times.

State: **The input must be a valid integer representing the number of test cases (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 for each test case)**.

Since the loop body is omitted, we can only ensure that the input is correctly formatted for the loop to execute the intended number of times. The internal state of each test case (the permutation `p` and the queries) will be handled within the loop body, which is not provided in this context.
