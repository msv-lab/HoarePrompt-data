You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates and prints either `-1` or a non-negative integer `k` based on the conditions provided. The value of `k` is calculated as `a` plus the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3, with an additional increment if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3. The input values `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the function processes each test case independently.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description:

### Program Analysis

The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences. Here are the key points:

1. **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals**: Can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

The program provided is as follows:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)
```

### Verification

Let's go through the logic of the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals for each test case.

2. **Checking Extroverts**: The condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:` checks if the extroverts can be fully accommodated in groups of three. If not, and there aren't enough universals to fill the remaining spots in a tent, it returns `-1`.

3. **Calculating Tents**:
   - `k += a`: Adds one tent for each introvert.
   - `k += (b + c) // 3`: Adds the number of full tents that can be formed by combining extroverts and universals.
   - `if (b + c) % 3 != 0:` If there are any remaining people after forming full tents, an additional tent is added.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases:

- **All Introverts**: If there are only introverts, the number of tents needed is equal to the number of introverts. This is handled correctly by `k += a`.
- **All Extroverts**: If there are only extroverts and they can be evenly divided into groups of three, the number of tents needed is `b // 3`. If not, and there aren't enough universals to fill the remaining spots, the program correctly returns `-1`.
- **All Universals**: If there are only universals, they can be grouped in any way, so the number of tents needed is `(c + 2) // 3`. This is handled correctly by the logic `(b + c) // 3` and the additional tent if there's a remainder.
- **Mixed Cases**: The program correctly handles cases where there are a mix of introverts, extroverts, and universals by ensuring that extroverts are always in groups of three and adding additional tents as needed.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic and edge cases, the program appears to correctly handle all scenarios described in the problem statement. There are no apparent cases where the program would produce incorrect results.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed for all participants according to their preferences. It properly handles cases where it's impossible to accommodate all participants and returns `-1` when necessary.
