To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the given code snippet and understand how it processes each input line.

The code reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it checks the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. The state of the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` changes with each iteration, but the variable `t` (which represents the number of test cases) does not change.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **If `x < k - 1`:**
   - If `a >= x + 1`, print 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, print 'NO'.

2. **If `x == k - 1`:**
   - If `a >= x + 2`, print 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, print 'NO'.

3. **If `x > k - 1`:**
   - Initialize `z` to `k - 2`.
   - For `i` in the range `x - k + 3`, update `z` using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - If `a >= z`, print 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Since the loop iterates over all test cases and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each one, the output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one per test case.

Given that the initial state specifies `t` as the number of test cases and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Output State: **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one per test case, based on the conditions specified in the code.**
