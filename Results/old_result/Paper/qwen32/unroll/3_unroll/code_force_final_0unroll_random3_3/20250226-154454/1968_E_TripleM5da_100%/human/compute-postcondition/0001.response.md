To determine the output state, we need to understand how the given loop processes each test case. The loop reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which is the size of an `n x n` grid. The loop then prints specific coordinates based on the value of `n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the loop does for each test case:
1. It prints the coordinates `(1, 1)`.
2. It prints the coordinates `(1, 2)`.
3. It then enters another loop that runs from `i = 3` to `i = n`, printing the coordinates `(i, i)` for each `i`.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

If the input is:
```
2
3
4
```

The output will be:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
1 1
1 2
3 3
4 4
```

The first two lines are for the first test case where `n = 3`, and the last three lines are for the second test case where `n = 4`.

In general, for each test case with size `n`, the output will be:
- `1 1`
- `1 2`
- Followed by `n-2` lines of the form `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n`.

Given the format of the problem, the output state can be described as a series of printed coordinates for each test case. Since the exact number of test cases and their respective `n` values are not provided in the problem statement, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **For each test case with size `n`, the output consists of the lines `1 1`, `1 2`, and `(i, i)` for each `i` from `3` to `n`.**
