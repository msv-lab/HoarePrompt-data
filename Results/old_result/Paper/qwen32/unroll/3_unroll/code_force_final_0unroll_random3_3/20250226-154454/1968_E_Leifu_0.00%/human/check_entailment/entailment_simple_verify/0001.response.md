### Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not guarantee to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all `n`. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **For `n = 2`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`
   - Possible Manhattan distances: `{0, 1}`
   - The program correctly outputs these points, and the set of distinct distances is maximized.

2. **For `n = 3`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`
   - Possible Manhattan distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3}`
   - The program correctly outputs these points, and the set of distinct distances is maximized.

3. **For `n > 3`:**
   - The program outputs points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for `j` from `4` to `n`.
   - The distances generated by these points are:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `1`
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `4`
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `3`
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(j, j)`: `2(j-1)`
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(j, j)`: `2(j-1) - 1`
     - Between `(2, 4)` and `(j, j)`: `2(j-3)`
     - Between `(j, j)` and `(k, k)`: `2|j-k|`
   - While this strategy generates a variety of distances, it does not necessarily cover all possible distances. For example, for `n = 4`, the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)` do not yield the maximum possible distinct distances. A better strategy would be to place points in a way that maximizes the variety of distances, such as placing points on a diagonal with some offset.

### Example for `n = 4`:
- Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(3, 1)`, `(4, 4)`
- Possible Manhattan distances:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 3)`: `2`
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(3, 1)`: `2`
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `6`
  - Between `(1, 3)` and `(3, 1)`: `4`
  - Between `(1, 3)` and `(4, 4)`: `4`
  - Between `(3, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `6`
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 1)`: `0`
  - Between `(1, 3)` and `(1, 3)`: `0`
  - Between `(3, 1)` and `(3, 1)`: `0`
  - Between `(4, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `0`
- Distinct distances: `{0, 2, 4, 6}`

The provided program does not generate this set of points for `n = 4`, and thus does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all `n`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
