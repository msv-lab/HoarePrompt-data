Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two lists, and an even integer `k` representing a specific condition. It also accepts a list `a` of `n` integers and a list `b` of `m` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**
