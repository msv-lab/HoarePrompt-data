Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all his buns given the promotion rules. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate the profit for a given `k`. Instead, it checks whether a certain calculated value is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not relevant to the problem's objective.

To find the maximum profit, the program should calculate the profit for each possible `k` (from 0 to `min(n, b)`) and then determine which `k` yields the highest profit. The profit for a given `k` can be calculated as the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

The function `func_1` should calculate the actual profit for a given `k` and return whether this profit is the maximum found so far. However, the provided `func_1` does not do this. It simply checks if `k * b + (n - k) * a` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct logic for determining the maximum profit.

The binary search logic is also incorrect for this problem since the profit function is not necessarily monotonic in `k` (it could have a peak and then decrease again), so a binary search is not appropriate for finding the maximum profit.

Given the current implementation, the program is not correct as it does not compute the maximum profit as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
