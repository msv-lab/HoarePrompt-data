To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand what the code does. The code iterates over a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a tuple containing integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a count based on the residues of the numbers in the list when divided by `x` and `y`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in the loop:

1. For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)`, initialize `count` to 0 and `residue_map` to an empty dictionary.
2. For each number `num` in the list `arr`:
   - Calculate `r_x` as `-num % x`.
   - Calculate `r_y` as `num % y`.
   - Add the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` to `count`. This checks how many times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before.
   - Update `residue_map` to include the current number's residue pair `(num % x, num % y)`, incrementing its count by 1.
3. After processing all numbers in the list, append the final `count` to the `results` list.

The `results` list will contain the counts for each test case, where each count represents the number of pairs of numbers in the list that have the same residues when divided by `x` and `-x` (or `y`).

Given the initial state with `test_cases` and an empty `results` list, the output state will have the `results` list populated with the counts calculated for each test case.

Output State: **results** is a list of integers, where each integer is the count of pairs of numbers in the corresponding test case that have the same residues when divided by `x` and `-x` (or `y`), and **test_cases** remains unchanged.
