You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input for each of `t` test cases. For each test case, it prints 'Yes' if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations
1. **Parity of Moves**: Adding or removing a cube changes the number of cubes by 1, which means each move changes the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes.
    - If we start with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, we will have an even number of cubes.
    - If we start with 0 cubes (even), after an odd number of moves, we will have an odd number of cubes.
2. **Minimum Moves Required**: To have `m` cubes, the number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because you can't remove a cube if there are none, and you need to add cubes to reach `m`.
3. **Parity Condition**: The difference between the number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must be even because the parity of the number of cubes changes with each move.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise, it prints "No".

### Verification of Conditions
1. **Parity Condition**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the parity of the number of cubes changes correctly.
2. **Minimum Moves Condition**: `n - m >= 0` ensures that we don't need more cubes than the number of moves, which is a valid constraint because we can't remove more cubes than we have.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity and minimum moves conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks both the parity condition and the minimum moves condition to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
Correctness: **True**
