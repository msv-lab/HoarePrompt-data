Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play by both Alice and Bob. The code incorrectly assumes that if there is a pile with 1 stone, Bob will win. This is not always true. 

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
2
2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In this case, there are two piles with 2 stones each. Alice can choose `k = 2` and remove 2 stones from each pile, making all piles empty. Since Alice makes the last move, she wins.

However, the provided code will output "Bob" because it checks if `1` is in the list of piles and incorrectly concludes that Bob wins.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
