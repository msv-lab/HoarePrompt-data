To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally.

Let's break down the problem and the solution:

### Problem Analysis:
- You and Nene each have `n` cards, and each card has a number from 1 to `n`.
- Each number appears exactly twice in the deck.
- Players take turns placing cards on the table.
- You get a point if the card you place matches a card already on the table.
- Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.

### Optimal Strategy:
- The key insight is that you can get a point only if you place a card that has already been placed by Nene.
- To maximize your points, you should try to place cards that have already been placed by Nene.
- Since Nene plays optimally, she will delay placing cards that you can use to score points until the last possible moment.

### Solution Analysis:
- The function `func_1` calculates the number of pairs in your hand.
- It then returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` because you can get at most `n // 2` points (one point per turn).

### Verification:
- The number of pairs in your hand represents the potential points you can get.
- However, Nene's optimal strategy can reduce the number of points you can actually get.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of pairs, but it does not account for Nene's strategy to minimize your score.
- The function assumes that you can get a point for every pair, but Nene's strategy might prevent you from getting all the points from pairs.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not fully account for Nene's optimal strategy, which can reduce the number of points you can get. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
