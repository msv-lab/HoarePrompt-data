Output State: **`left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `max_diff` will hold the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` will hold the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` will hold the index `i` where the largest difference `max_diff` occurs, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged, `ans` is `max_diff`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `max_diff`. All other variables retain their initial values.
