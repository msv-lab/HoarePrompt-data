The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `a`. The `Counter` will count the occurrences of each unique element in the list `a`.

Given the initial state, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` has been incremented by `i + 1`. The `Counter` object `counter` will store the frequency of each element in this modified list `a`.

The values of `n` and the original list `a` remain unchanged, but a new variable `counter` is introduced and populated with the counts of each element in the modified list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is the original `a_i` plus `i + 1`; `counter` is a Counter object that stores the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`.**
