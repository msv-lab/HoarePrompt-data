To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the code together.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The greatest common divisor (gcd) is the largest positive integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.

### Code Analysis
The provided code snippet is as follows:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)
```

For each test case, the code calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) and prints \( y \). 

### Evaluation
While the choice of \( y = x // 2 \) might work for some values of \( x \), it does not guarantee that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. Here are some counterexamples where \( y = x // 2 \) does not yield the maximum value:

1. **Example with x = 7:**
   - The code will output \( y = 7 // 2 = 3 \).
   - However, \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - The correct choice would be \( y = 6 \), as \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).

2. **Example with x = 10:**
   - The code will output \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \).
   - However, \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
   - While this is optimal for this case, it's not guaranteed for all values of \( x \).

### Conclusion
The code does not always find the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
