n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t representing the starting nodes where the stone is initially put, with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
