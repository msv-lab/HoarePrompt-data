You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, y is an integer which is the result of integer division of the corresponding x by 2, where x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Key Observations:
1. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
2. The value of \( y \) should be chosen such that \( \gcd(x, y) \) is maximized and \( y \) is as large as possible, given the constraint \( y < x \).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program simply sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \) for each test case and prints it. Let's evaluate if this approach always yields the maximum value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

1. **Choosing \( y = x // 2 \):**
   - When \( y = x // 2 \), \( y \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is a divisor of \( x \) if \( x \) is even.
   - However, if \( x \) is odd, \( x // 2 \) is not a divisor of \( x \), and the GCD will be smaller.
   - For example, if \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \) (since \( 7 // 2 = 3 \)), and \( \gcd(7, 3) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 4 \).
   - But, the correct answer for \( x = 7 \) should be \( y = 6 \) because \( \gcd(7, 6) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7 \), which is the maximum possible value.

2. **General Case:**
   - The program does not consider other potential values of \( y \) that might yield a higher \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For example, if \( x = 21 \), the program would output \( y = 10 \), but the correct answer is \( y = 18 \) because \( \gcd(21, 18) = 3 \), and \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 21 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not always provide the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). It only considers \( y = x // 2 \), which is not guaranteed to be optimal in all cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
