Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are integers with specific constraints; `A`, which is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order; `D`, which is a list of `m` integers; and `F`, which is a list of `k` integers. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output conditions are not detailed in the given information.**
