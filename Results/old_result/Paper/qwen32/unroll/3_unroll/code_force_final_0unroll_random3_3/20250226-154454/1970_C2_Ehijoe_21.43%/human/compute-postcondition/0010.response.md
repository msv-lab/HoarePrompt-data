To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the function `func_1(nodes, start)` on the provided variables. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only assume that it modifies or uses the variables `nodes` and `start` in some way and returns a value `moves`.

Given the initial state and the function call, we can infer the following:
- `nodes` is a defaultdict with default values as empty lists.
- `start` is an integer provided by user input within the range 1 to 5.
- `n` is 5.
- `t` is 3.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `empty` is True.
- `leaves` is an empty deque.

Since `moves` is assigned the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, we will include `moves` in the output state. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `leaves`) are not modified by the provided code snippet, so they remain the same.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where the default value for each key is an empty list; `start` is the integer provided by the user input such that 1 <= `start` <= 5; `n` is 5; `t` is 3; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is an empty deque; `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`.**
