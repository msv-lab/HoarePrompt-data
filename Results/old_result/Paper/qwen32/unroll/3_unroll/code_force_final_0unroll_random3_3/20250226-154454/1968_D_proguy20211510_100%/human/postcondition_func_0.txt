The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible score for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their paths defined by `p` and values defined by `a`, with up to `k` steps allowed. It then prints the name of the player with the higher score, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.
