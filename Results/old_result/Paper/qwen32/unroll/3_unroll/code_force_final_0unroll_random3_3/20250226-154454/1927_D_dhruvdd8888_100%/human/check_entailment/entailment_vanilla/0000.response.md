Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
For each test case, we have:
- An array `a` of `n` integers.
- `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`.
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we output `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array `nums` itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program constructs a list `arr` which contains tuples representing contiguous segments of the array with the same value. Each tuple is of the form `(start, end, value)`, where `start` is the starting index of the segment, `end` is the ending index (exclusive), and `value` is the value of the elements in that segment.
   - It appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the last segment correctly.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first segment that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the segment found to determine if it can provide a valid pair of indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`.
   - The logic used to determine the indices is flawed:
     - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the previous segment can provide a valid pair. However, this logic does not correctly handle all cases.
     - If the segment ends before or at `r`, it checks if the next segment can provide a valid pair. This logic also does not correctly handle all cases.
     - The conditions for printing `-1 -1` are not correctly defined and might lead to incorrect outputs.

### Example Issues:
Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issues:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  1 2 3
  1
  1 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 2
  ```
- Actual Output of the Program:
  ```
  1 2
  ```
  In this case, the program works correctly. However, let's consider another case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  1 1 1
  1
  1 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  -1 -1
  ```
- Actual Output of the Program:
  ```
  1 2
  ```
  Here, the program incorrectly outputs `1 2` instead of `-1 -1` because it does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the range are the same.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
