You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of sticks available. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the stick lengths.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `ans` is 0. `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a`, and each value is the count of that stick length in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of each stick count in `cnt` by 4. `cnt` remains unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the integer divisions of each stick count in cnt by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. It calculates and prints the total number of complete sets of four sticks that can be formed from each test case based on the stick lengths provided.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only considers forming squares (polygons with 4 sides) and does not account for forming other regular polygons such as triangles (3 sides), pentagons (5 sides), hexagons (6 sides), etc. The problem description requires forming the maximum number of regular polygons with any number of equal sides, not just squares.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The correct output should be `1` because we can form a hexagon (6-sided polygon) with the 6 sticks of length 2. However, the provided program will output `0` because it only checks for the number of squares that can be formed (which requires 4 sticks each).

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the general case of forming any regular polygon with any number of sides.
