You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function accepts no arguments but reads input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: - After processing all test cases, the only variables that have changed are `i` (the loop counter) and `n` (the current test case value).
    #   - The variable `power` is recalculated for each test case and does not persist beyond the current iteration.
    #   - The variable `n_cases` remains unchanged after the loop completes.
    #
    #The final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing all iterations is:
    #
    #- `i` will be equal to `n_cases` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n_cases - 1`).
    #- `n` will be the value of the last test case processed.
    #- `power` will be undefined or the value from the last iteration, but it is not relevant to the output state.
    #
    #The output state is described by the printed values for each test case, which are determined by the logic inside the loop.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each `n`, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program based on the problem description.

The task involves performing a series of swap operations on an array where initially, each element is equal to its index (1-based). The operation swap(k) involves finding the largest divisor of k (excluding k itself) and swapping the elements at indices k and d. After performing these operations for all k from 2 to n, we need to find the position of the element 1 in the resulting array.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem but seems to follow an incorrect approach. Here's the code again for reference:

```python
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Base Case (n == 1):**
   - The program correctly handles the base case where `n == 1`. The array is `[1]`, and no operations are performed, so the position of 1 remains 1.

2. **General Case (n > 1):**
   - The program attempts to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and then prints `2 ** power`. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the swapping process described in the problem.
   - The program does not actually perform the swaps or track the position of the element 1. Instead, it relies on a mathematical observation that doesn't correctly model the behavior of the swaps.

### Testing with Example Cases:

Let's test the program with the example cases provided in the problem description:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   4
   1
   4
   5
   120240229
   ```
   
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   1
   4
   4
   67108864
   ```

   **Actual Output from Program:**
   ```
   1
   2
   2
   67108864
   ```

   - The program fails for `n = 4` and `n = 5`. For `n = 4`, the correct output should be `4`, not `2`. For `n = 5`, the correct output should also be `4`, not `2`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It fails to simulate the swap operations and instead uses an incorrect mathematical approach that does not always yield the correct result.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly simulate the swap operations as described in the problem statement. Instead, it relies on a mathematical observation that does not accurately model the behavior of the swaps. This results in incorrect outputs for certain input cases, such as `n = 4` and `n = 5`.
