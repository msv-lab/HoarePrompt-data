Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum score based on the problem description. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**: The program attempts to calculate the maximum score by multiplying differences between consecutive elements in the modified list `a`. This approach does not correctly account for the number of permutations of length `n` that can be formed.

2. **Handling of `k`**: The program adjusts the number of cards based on `k` but does not correctly distribute the additional cards to maximize the number of permutations.

3. **Factorial Usage**: The program uses `math.factorial(n)` when `k >= n * m`, which is incorrect. The factorial of `n` represents the number of permutations of `n` distinct items, but here, the items are not necessarily distinct.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:

- Determine the minimum number of cards of each type, `m`.
- Calculate the total number of permutations of length `n` that can be formed with the available cards and the additional `k` cards.
- Distribute the `k` additional cards in a way that maximizes the number of valid permutations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        m = min(a)
        total_permutations = 0
        
        if k >= n * m:
            # We can make at least one complete permutation of [1, 2, ..., n]
            total_permutations = sum(a) - n * m + 1
            total_permutations = total_permutations * math.factorial(n)
        else:
            # Distribute k cards optimally
            remaining = [a[i] - m for i in range(n)]
            k_used = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if k_used + remaining[i] <= k:
                    k_used += remaining[i]
                    remaining[i] = 0
                else:
                    remaining[i] -= (k - k_used)
                    k_used = k
                    break
            
            # Calculate the number of valid permutations
            total_permutations = 1
            for count in remaining:
                total_permutations *= (count + 1)
        
        print(total_permutations)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the number of valid permutations by distributing the additional `k` cards optimally and then computing the product of the counts of each card type plus one.
