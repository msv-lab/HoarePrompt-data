The function reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99) from the input, performs calculations based on the values of `x` and `y`, and prints an integer result. The result is the sum of two calculated values: the ceiling of `y / 2` and the ceiling of `(x - (math.ceil(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)) / 15` if `x` and `y` are both greater than 0. If only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`. If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.
