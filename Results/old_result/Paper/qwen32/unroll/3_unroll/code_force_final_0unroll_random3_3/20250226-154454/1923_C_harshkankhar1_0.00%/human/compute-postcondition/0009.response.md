Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `c` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list `c` contains `n` integers, each greater than 0 and up to 10^9. For each query, it accepts two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range within the list `c`. The function processes these queries and returns the sum of the elements in the list `c` for each specified range `[l_i, r_i]`.**
