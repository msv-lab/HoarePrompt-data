You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining if a subarray is good is flawed.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for `b` Array Construction**:
   - The `b` array is constructed such that each element `b[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of a hypothetical array `b` where each `b[i]` is either 1 or 2. This is done to ensure `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`.
   - However, the logic `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` is not sufficient to guarantee that `a_i != b_i` for all `i`. For example, if `a[i] = 2`, then `b[i]` could be set to `1`, but if `a[i] = 1`, then `b[i]` is set to `2`. This does not guarantee that `a_i != b_i` for all `i` because if `a[i] = 2` and `b[i] = 1`, then `a_i != b_i`, but if `a[i] = 1` and `b[i] = 2`, then `a_i != b_i` as well, but this logic does not handle cases where `a[i]` could be any number other than 1 or 2 correctly.

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is used to determine if the subarray is not good. This condition is not correctly derived from the problem's requirements.
   - The correct condition should check if there exists a `b` array such that the sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of the corresponding `b` subarray and `a_i != b_i` for all `i` in the subarray. The provided condition does not ensure this.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     3 1
     1 1 1
     1 3
     ```
   - The program will output `NO` for this input, but the correct output should be `YES` because we can construct `b` as `[2, 2, 2]`, which satisfies all the conditions:
     - \(\sum a_i = \sum b_i = 3\)
     - \(a_i \neq b_i\) for all \(i\)
     - \(b_i > 0\) for all \(i\)

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
