### Reasoning

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on specific divisibility conditions. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - These values are stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)`, the program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` encountered so far.
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`.
     - It increments the counter `count` by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before, which is obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
     - It updates `residue_map` to include the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program returns a list of counts, one for each test case.
   - These counts represent the number of beautiful pairs in each array.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the logic using the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `n=6`, `x=5`, `y=2`, `arr=[1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
  - Beautiful pairs: `(1, 5)` and `(4, 6)`.
  - The program should correctly count these pairs.

- **Test Case 2**: `n=7`, `x=9`, `y=5`, `arr=[1, 10, 15, 3, 8, 12, 15]`
  - No beautiful pairs.
  - The program should return `0`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n=9`, `x=4`, `y=10`, `arr=[14, 10, 2, 2, 11, 11, 13, 5, 6]`
  - Beautiful pair: `(2, 5)`.
  - The program should return `1`.

- **Test Case 4**: `n=9`, `x=5`, `y=6`, `arr=[10, 7, 6, 7, 9, 7, 7, 10, 10]`
  - Beautiful pairs: `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 3)`, `(2, 5)`, `(3, 6)`.
  - The program should return `6`.

- **Test Case 5**: `n=9`, `x=6`, `y=2`, `arr=[4, 9, 7, 1, 2, 2, 13, 3, 15]`
  - Beautiful pairs: `(1, 3)`, `(2, 4)`, `(2, 7)`, `(3, 5)`, `(3, 8)`, `(4, 6)`, `(5, 9)`.
  - The program should return `7`.

- **Test Case 6**: `n=9`, `x=2`, `y=3`, `arr=[14, 6, 1, 15, 12, 15, 8, 2, 15]`
  - No beautiful pairs.
  - The program should return `0`.

- **Test Case 7**: `n=10`, `x=5`, `y=7`, `arr=[13, 3, 3, 2, 12, 11, 3, 7, 13, 14]`
  - No beautiful pairs.
  - The program should return `0`.

The program's logic correctly identifies the conditions for a pair to be beautiful and counts them efficiently using a dictionary to track residues. Given the constraints and the example, the program appears to be correct.
