The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `answers`. The initial state describes several variables related to test cases, but none of these are directly affected by the code snippet provided. The only change is the introduction of the `answers` list.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. Each of the following `test_cases` lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `answers` is an empty list.**
