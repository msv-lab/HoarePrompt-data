#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The string encoded is guaranteed to be a valid result of the encoding process described in the problem statement.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: `encoded` is unchanged; `mapping` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'; `decoded` is a list of characters where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding unique character from 'a' to 'z' as defined in the `mapping` dictionary.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the characters in the `decoded` list, where each character in the original `encoded` string has been replaced by its corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' as defined in the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each unique character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z'. The mapping of characters from `encoded` to 'a' to 'z' is consistent throughout the string.
