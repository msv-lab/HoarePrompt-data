To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Promotion:**
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at decreasing prices from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum profit Bob can earn by choosing an optimal \( k \).

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It then calculates the maximum profit based on the following conditions:
     - If \( b \le a \): It means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
     - If \( b - a \ge n \): It implies that selling the first \( n \) buns at the modified price is the best option. The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 can be calculated using the formula \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2} \).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the profit by selling the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price \( a \).

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** \( b \le a \) is correctly handled by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - **Condition 2:** \( b - a \ge n \) correctly calculates the maximum profit by selling all buns at the modified price.
   - **Else Case:** Correctly calculates the profit by selling the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - For the test case `4 4 5`:
     - \( b - a = 1 \), which is less than \( n \), so it calculates the profit as \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \).
   - For the test case `5 5 9`:
     - \( b - a = 4 \), which is less than \( n \), so it calculates the profit as \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \).
   - For the test case `10 10 5`:
     - \( b \le a \), so it calculates the profit as \( 10 \cdot 10 = 100 \).
   - For the test case `5 5 11`:
     - \( b - a = 6 \), which is greater than \( n \), so it calculates the profit as \( \frac{(2 \cdot 11 - 5 + 1) \cdot 5}{2} = 45 \).
   - For the test cases with \( n \) and \( a \) and \( b \) all equal to \( 10^9 \):
     - \( b - a = 0 \), so it calculates the profit as \( 10^9 \cdot 10^9 = 10^{18} \).
   - For the test case `1000 1 1000`:
     - \( b - a = 999 \), which is greater than \( n \), so it calculates the profit as \( \frac{(2 \cdot 1000 - 1000 + 1) \cdot 1000}{2} = 500500 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all given conditions and calculates the maximum profit for each test case accurately.

Correctness: **True**
