### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - Construct a string `r` consisting of all distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given the encoded string `b`, reconstruct the original string `s` by reversing the encoding process.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
- It then calls `func_1(encoded)` to perform the decoding.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function initializes an empty `mapping` dictionary and an empty `decoded` list.
- For each character in the encoded string `b`:
  - If the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary, it appends the corresponding value (original character) to the `decoded` list.
  - If the character is not in the `mapping` dictionary, it iterates over all lowercase letters to find one that is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary, assigns this new letter to the current character in `b`, and appends the new letter to the `decoded` list.
- Finally, it joins the `decoded` list into a string and returns it.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding process. It assigns new characters from 'a' to 'z' to each character in `b` without considering the symmetric property of `r`.
- The symmetric property of `r` means that the first character of `r` should map to the last character of `r`, the second character to the second last, and so on.
- The function `func_1` does not construct the string `r` or use it to determine the symmetric mapping. Instead, it simply assigns new characters without any reference to the original encoding process.

#### Function Summary Validation:
- The function summary describes the function as mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z', which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to use the symmetric property of `r`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s` as per the problem description. The function `func_1` does not implement the symmetric mapping based on the string `r`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
