Reasoning: 

The provided function `func_1` aims to determine if there exists a template `t` for each test case such that strings `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. The function iterates through each character position in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. 

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Match Condition for `a` and `b`:** If `a[i] == b[i]`, then for `a` and `b` to match a template `t`, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]` since they are the same). If this condition is met, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

2. **Mismatch Condition for `a` and `b`:** If `a[i] != b[i]`, then for `a` and `b` to match the template, we need to ensure that `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next position. However, if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Decision Making:** If `possible` remains `False` after checking all positions, it means no such template exists where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not, and the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The function correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template that satisfies the given conditions for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
