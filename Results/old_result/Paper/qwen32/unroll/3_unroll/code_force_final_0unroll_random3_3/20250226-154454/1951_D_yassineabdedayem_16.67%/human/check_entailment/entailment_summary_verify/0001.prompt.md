You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it performs a series of operations to determine if `k` can be reduced to zero by subtracting products of pairs of numbers derived from `n` and `k`. If `k` is reduced to zero, it outputs 'YES', followed by the number of operations performed and the sequence of numbers used in the operations. If `k` cannot be reduced to zero, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next stall, and so on.

### Program Analysis
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `rep` is used to count the number of stalls created.
   - `number` is not used in the program.
   - `tab` is a list to store the prices of the stalls.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n` (coins) is not zero, `k` (remaining jewels) is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is at least `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max`:
     - `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
     - `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
   - The program then checks if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`. If true, it sets `number` to `Min` and subtracts `Max` from `k`. Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and subtracts `Min` from `k`.
   - The price `number` is appended to `tab`.
   - `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.
   - `rep` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - If `k` becomes zero, it prints "YES", the number of stalls created, and the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program
- The logic for calculating `Min` and `Max` and their usage in the loop is incorrect. The program does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- The condition `n * Min <= k` is not appropriate for the problem. The program does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the calculated prices.
- The program does not handle cases where the number of stalls exceeds 60 or where it is impossible to set up the stalls to meet the conditions.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve setting up stalls with prices that ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible solution is to use binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and their prices.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
