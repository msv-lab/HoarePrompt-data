The provided code snippet only includes a type variable declaration `T = TypeVar('T')`. This declaration does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, none of the variables in the initial state are modified by this code.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9; p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.**
