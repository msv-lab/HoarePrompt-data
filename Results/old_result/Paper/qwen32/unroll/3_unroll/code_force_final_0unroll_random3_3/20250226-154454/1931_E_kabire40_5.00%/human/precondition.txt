t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple (n, m) where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and the second element is a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
