The code `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicate elements from the list `a` and updates `a` to this new list. The values of `n`, `counter`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The new list `a` will contain only unique elements from the original modified list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the original array `a`; `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original modified list `a`; `counter` is a Counter object that stores the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`; `cur` is 0.**
