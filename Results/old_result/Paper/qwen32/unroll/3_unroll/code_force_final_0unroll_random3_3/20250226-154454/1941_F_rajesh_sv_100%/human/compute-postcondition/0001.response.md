In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `testcases`. The loop will execute if `testcases` is greater than or equal to 1.

Given:
- `testcases` is the integer value returned by `func_3()`, and it satisfies 1 <= `testcases` <= 10^4.

Since the loop depends solely on the value of `testcases` for execution, and the condition that `testcases` must be at least 1 is already satisfied by the given range (1 <= `testcases` <= 10^4), no adjustment is needed for `testcases`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already appropriate for the loop to execute.

State: **`testcases` is the integer value returned by `func_3()`, and it satisfies 1 <= `testcases` <= 10^4**
