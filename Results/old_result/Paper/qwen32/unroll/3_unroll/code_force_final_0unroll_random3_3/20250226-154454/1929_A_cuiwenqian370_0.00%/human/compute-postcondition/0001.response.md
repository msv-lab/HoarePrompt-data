The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `new_arr`. The initial state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `arr`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the creation of `new_arr` as an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list.**
