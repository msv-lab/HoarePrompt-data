Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The game revolves around the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) in combinatorial game theory, specifically for impartial games like this one. The winner can be determined by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR-sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If the XOR-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy assuming both play optimally.

The provided code instead checks for the presence of consecutive numbers in the sorted unique pile sizes, which does not align with the correct strategy for solving this problem. Therefore, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly predict the winner.

Correctness: **False**
