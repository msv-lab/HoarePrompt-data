Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).**

This means that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from the user, which indicates the number of test cases to be processed. The other variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
