### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the code and the provided function summaries to determine the correctness of the given program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times. The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the subarray), and setting all elements in that subarray to this MEX value.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` using memoization.
   - It considers different ways to split the subarray and computes the maximum sum recursively.
   - The function uses `res_dict` for memoization, which should be defined before using it.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.
   - It recursively determines the optimal splits and operations based on the results from `func_1`.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is supposed to transform a subarray into a staircase pattern.
   - It checks if the current subarray is already in a staircase pattern and modifies it if not.
   - The function modifies the array `arr` and appends operations to `res`.
   - The function uses `start_index` which is not defined within `make_stairs`. It should be passed as an argument.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Undefined Global Variables**:
  - `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` are used without being defined within the functions.
  - `res_dict` should be initialized before using it in `func_1`.

- **Incorrect Use of `start_index`**:
  - `start_index` is used in `func_2` but not passed to `make_stairs`, leading to potential incorrect behavior.

- **Incomplete Implementation**:
  - The `make_stairs` function does not handle all cases correctly and may not produce the intended staircase pattern.

- **Output Format**:
  - The code does not print the output in the required format.

- **Logic Errors**:
  - The logic for determining the maximum sum and the sequence of operations may not cover all possible cases.

#### Specific Example:
For the input:
```
3
1 3 9
```
The expected output is:
```
13 0
```
However, the code will likely fail due to the issues mentioned above and may not produce the correct output.

#### Function Summaries:
- The summary for `make_stairs` indicates that it modifies the array `arr` and appends tuples to `res`. However, it does not correctly handle the `start_index` variable, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code has several flaws that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described.

**Final: False**
