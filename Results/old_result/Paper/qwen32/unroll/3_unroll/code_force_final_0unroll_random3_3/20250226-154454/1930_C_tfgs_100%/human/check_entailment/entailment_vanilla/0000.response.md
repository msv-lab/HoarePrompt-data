Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We have an array `a` of length `n`.
   - We start with an empty set `S`.

2. **Operations:**
   - We perform the following operations exactly `n` times:
     1. Select an index `i` such that `1 <= i <= |a|`.
     2. Insert `a[i] + i` into the set `S`. Since `S` is a set, it will only contain unique values.
     3. Delete `a[i]` from `a`. This shifts all elements to the right of `a[i]` one position to the left.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - After all operations, `a` is empty, and `S` contains unique values.
   - We construct a new array `b` by sorting the elements of `S` in decreasing order.
   - We need to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

### Key Observations:

- Since `S` is a set, we only need to consider unique values.
- To maximize the lexicographical order, we should try to maximize the values being inserted into `S`.
- Inserting `a[i] + i` means that the larger the value of `a[i]` and the higher the index `i`, the larger the value being inserted.
- Therefore, the optimal strategy is to always insert the largest possible `a[i] + i` into `S`.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program modifies the array `a` by adding the index (plus one) to each element: `a[i] += i + 1`.
   - It then creates a set from `a` to ensure uniqueness and sorts it in decreasing order.
   - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the counts of each unique value.
   - It constructs the result array `ans` by iterating over the sorted unique values and appending them to `ans` while also considering the counts of each value.

3. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the result array `ans` by considering the counts of each unique value and appending the appropriate number of each value in decreasing order.
   - It also handles the case where there are duplicate values in the original array by inserting the appropriate number of intermediate values to maintain the lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
