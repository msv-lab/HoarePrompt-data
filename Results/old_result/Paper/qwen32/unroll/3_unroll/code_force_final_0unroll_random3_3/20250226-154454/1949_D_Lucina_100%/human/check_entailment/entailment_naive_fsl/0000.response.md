Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Upon analyzing the provided code, there are several issues that suggest it may not always satisfy the problem's constraints:

1. **Handling of Undecided Videos**: The code attempts to balance the number of 'F' and 'S' videos by appending indices to `sa` and `sb` based on the initial counts of 'F' and 'S'. However, the logic for deciding whether to append an index to `sa` or `sb` and the subsequent decision to assign 'F' or 'S' to undecided videos seems flawed. Specifically, the condition `i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]` (and its counterpart for `sb`) is not well-founded and could lead to an imbalance in the number of 'F' and 'S' videos.

2. **Balancing Constraint**: The code does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown for any permutation of scenarios. The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to undecided videos does not take into account the potential sequences that could arise from different permutations of scenarios.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the number of 'F' and 'S' videos is already close to the maximum allowed consecutive count. For example, if most of the initial videos are already 'F' or 'S', the code might not correctly assign the remaining videos to avoid exceeding the limit.

To illustrate a potential issue, consider the following input:

```
6
.FFF???
F.F???
FF.F???
FFF.F??
????.??
?????.?
```

For this input, the code might not correctly assign the remaining '?' characters to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 6}{4} \rceil = 5\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown for any permutation of scenarios.

Given these issues, the code does not guarantee that it will work correctly for all possible inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
