The function accepts no arguments but reads input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a.
