Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b`, `m` <= 10^18.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of the input, which is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The conditions for `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are described in the initial state and have not been modified by the provided code snippet.
