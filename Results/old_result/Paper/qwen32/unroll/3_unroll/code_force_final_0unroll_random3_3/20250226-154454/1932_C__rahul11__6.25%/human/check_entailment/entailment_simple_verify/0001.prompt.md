You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: For each test case, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is the product of the remaining elements in `arr` after processing the corresponding character in `s`, taken modulo `m` and `MOD`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `MOD`) remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `arr`, and the string `s` of commands.

2. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It then calculates the remainder of this product when divided by `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s` (except the last one, since the array will be empty after processing the last command).
   - For each command:
     - If the command is 'L', it divides the current product `ans` by the leftmost element of the array (which is `arr[l]`), updates `ans` accordingly, and then calculates the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in `res[c]`.
     - If the command is 'R', it divides the current product `ans` by the rightmost element of the array (which is `arr[r]`), updates `ans` accordingly, and then calculates the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in `res[c]`.
     - It then increments the index `c` and adjusts the left (`l`) or right (`r`) pointers accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all commands, the program prints the results stored in `res`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Division by Array Elements:**
   - The program attempts to divide the current product `ans` by the leftmost or rightmost element of the array. However, integer division (`//`) in Python does not work as expected for products that are not exact multiples of the divisor. This can lead to incorrect results.
   - Instead, the program should use modular arithmetic properties to maintain the product modulo `m` throughout the process.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses a large constant `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct modulus to use is `m` as specified in the problem.
   - The program incorrectly applies the modulo operation multiple times (`ans % m % MOD`), which is redundant and can lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness

Given the issues with division and incorrect use of the modulo operation, the program is not correct. The logic for maintaining the product modulo `m` and processing commands is flawed.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
