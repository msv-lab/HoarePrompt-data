Postcondition: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases such that 1 <= q <= 100, `w` is the square root of `q` and `w` is an integer (i.e., `w == w // 1`) if and only if `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `M` is a list containing the single element `w` if the condition is true. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.**
