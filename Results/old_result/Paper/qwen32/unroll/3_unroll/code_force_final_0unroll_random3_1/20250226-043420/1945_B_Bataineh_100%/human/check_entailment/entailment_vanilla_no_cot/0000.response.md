Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The logic in the program does not account for the correct overlap of fireworks from both installations. Here's a breakdown of why it is incorrect:

1. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time can be determined by simple comparisons of `a`, `b`, and `m`. 
   - It does not correctly calculate the number of overlapping fireworks from both installations within a given time frame.

2. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a time frame and then determining the overlap of these intervals.
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` is crucial to determine the periodicity of fireworks launches.
   - For each period of LCM, we need to calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation and then determine the overlap.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Number of fireworks launched by each installation within lcm_ab minutes
        count_a = m // a + 1
        count_b = m // b + 1
        
        # Overlapping fireworks
        overlap = (m // lcm_ab + 1)
        
        # Total fireworks visible at the same time
        total = count_a + count_b - overlap
        print(total)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the periodicity of fireworks launches and calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within one period of LCM. It then calculates the overlap of these intervals to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
