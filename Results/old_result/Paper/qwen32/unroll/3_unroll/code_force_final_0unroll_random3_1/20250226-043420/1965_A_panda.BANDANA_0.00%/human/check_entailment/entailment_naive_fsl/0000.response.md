Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible cases. The current logic only checks if there is a pile with exactly one stone and incorrectly concludes that Bob wins if so. This is not always true.

The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if the opponent plays optimally. Otherwise, the player is in a winning position.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2
2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In this case, both piles have 2 stones. The Nim-sum is `2 ^ 2 = 0`, which means Alice (the first player) is in a losing position if both play optimally. Thus, Bob should win. However, the program will print "Alice" because it only checks for the presence of a pile with exactly one stone, which is not the correct condition for determining the winner in this game.

To correctly determine the winner, the program should compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and print "Alice" if the Nim-sum is non-zero and "Bob" if it is zero.
