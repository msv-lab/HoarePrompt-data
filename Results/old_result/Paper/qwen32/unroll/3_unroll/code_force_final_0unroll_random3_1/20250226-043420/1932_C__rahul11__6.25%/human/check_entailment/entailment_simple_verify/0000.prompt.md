You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Product and Modulo**:
   - The program calculates the initial product of the array elements and then divides it by the removed element to update the product for the next iteration. However, integer division (`//`) does not work correctly when the product is not perfectly divisible by the removed element, especially under modulo operations. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Modulo Operation Misuse**:
   - The code uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` which is unnecessary and incorrect in this context. The problem only requires taking the modulo `m` of the product, not an additional large modulo.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the product becomes zero modulo `m` early in the process. Once the product modulo `m` becomes zero, it should remain zero for all subsequent commands.

Here is an example that demonstrates the incorrect behavior:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
LRR
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 2 2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initial product modulo 3: `(1 * 2 * 3) % 3 = 6 % 3 = 0`
- Process 'L': Remove 1, new product modulo 3: `(2 * 3) % 3 = 6 % 3 = 0`
- Process 'R': Remove 3, new product modulo 3: `2 % 3 = 2`
- Process 'R': Remove 2, new product modulo 3: `0` (since the product was already zero)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
- The program might output incorrect values due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all cases, so the correctness is **False**.
