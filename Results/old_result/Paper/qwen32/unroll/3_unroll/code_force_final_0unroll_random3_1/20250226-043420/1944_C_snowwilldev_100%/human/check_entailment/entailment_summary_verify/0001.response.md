Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts first and alternates turns with Bob.
- Alice appends an element to `c` and removes it from `a`.
- Bob removes an element from `a` without adding it to `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score is the MEX of `c`, which Alice wants to maximize while Bob wants to minimize.
- We need to determine the final score if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
- **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.
- **Optimal Play**:
  - Alice can maximize the MEX by ensuring that the first `k` non-negative integers are present in `c`.
  - Bob can minimize the MEX by preventing the first `k` non-negative integers from being fully present in `c`.
- **Count Occurrences**: Count the occurrences of each number in `a` to determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies.

### Strategy
- **Count Occurrences**: Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in `a`.
- **Determine MEX**:
  - If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once in `a`, Alice can ensure that these numbers are in `c`, maximizing the MEX.
  - Otherwise, Bob can force the MEX to be lower by strategically removing elements.

### Code Analysis
Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The code correctly counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a `defaultdict`.
2. **Determining MEX**:
   - The variable `t` counts the number of unique numbers that appear exactly once.
   - The loop iterates through numbers from `0` to `N` and checks the count of each number.
   - If a number appears exactly once, `t` is incremented.
   - If `t` reaches `2`, it means there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, and the MEX is the current number `i`.
   - If a number does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), the MEX is the current number `i`.

### Correctness
The logic in the code correctly determines the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here's the reasoning:
- If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, Alice can ensure that these numbers are in `c`, maximizing the MEX.
- If no such numbers exist, Bob can force the MEX to be lower by removing elements that would otherwise be unique.

### Function Summary
The function summary states:
- The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
- For each test case, it returns the smallest integer from `0` to `n` that either appears exactly once in the list or does not appear at all.

This matches the logic implemented in the code. The function correctly identifies the MEX by checking the counts of numbers in the array.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the code correctly implements the solution to the problem. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the original assessment is correct.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**
