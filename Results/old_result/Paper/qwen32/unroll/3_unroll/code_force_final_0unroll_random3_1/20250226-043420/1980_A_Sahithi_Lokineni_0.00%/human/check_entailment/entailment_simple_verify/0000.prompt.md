You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. This is followed by a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The number of test cases, t, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Default Value Function**: The function `default_value` is referenced in the `defaultdict` initialization but is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Counting Additional Problems**: The logic in the program to count the additional problems needed is incorrect. The current logic adds `m - d[val]` to the answer for every difficulty level `val` that has `d[val] <= m`. However, this will overcount the problems that need to be created because it doesn't account for the fact that each round needs one problem of each difficulty level.

3. **Handling of Difficulty Levels**: The code does not explicitly check if all required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') are present and correctly counts the number of additional problems needed for each missing or underrepresented difficulty level.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
The program will likely produce an incorrect output due to the issues mentioned above.

**Correct Approach:**
For each test case, we need to count the occurrences of each difficulty level and then determine how many more problems are needed to ensure that each of the 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') has at least `m` problems.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def default_value():
    return 0

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for level in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[level] < m:
            ans += m - d[level]
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that we correctly count the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level, and it handles the default value properly.
