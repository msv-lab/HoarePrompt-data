You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Overview
The task is to process multiple test cases, each containing an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, we need to find two distinct indices within the specified range of the array such that the elements at these indices are different. If no such pair exists, we report `-1 -1`.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the elements of the array `nums`, the number of queries `q`, and then the queries themselves.

2. **Array Segmentation:**
   - The code attempts to segment the array into contiguous segments of equal elements. This is done using a loop that tracks the start `s` and end `e` of each segment and the value `num` of elements in that segment.
   - The segments are stored in the list `arr` as tuples `(start_index, end_index, value)`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the code uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary of the query.
   - The code then checks several conditions to determine if a valid pair of indices can be found:
     - If the segment starts after the left boundary, it checks if the previous segment can provide a valid pair.
     - If the segment ends before or at the right boundary, it checks if the next segment can provide a valid pair.
     - If the segment ends after the right boundary, it checks if the current segment can provide a valid pair.
   - If no valid pair is found, it outputs `-1 -1`.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Query Handling:**
   - The code does not correctly handle all cases for finding a valid pair of indices. Specifically, it does not consider all possible segments that could contain a valid pair within the query range.
   - For example, if a query range contains multiple segments, the code might miss valid pairs that span across these segments.

2. **Incorrect Output for Some Queries:**
   - The code incorrectly handles queries where the segment starts exactly at the left boundary or ends exactly at the right boundary. It might output `-1 -1` even when a valid pair exists.

3. **Debugging Code:**
   - The code contains debugging prints that are conditionally executed based on the test case number. These should be removed or commented out for the final version.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the query handling and output logic, the code does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
