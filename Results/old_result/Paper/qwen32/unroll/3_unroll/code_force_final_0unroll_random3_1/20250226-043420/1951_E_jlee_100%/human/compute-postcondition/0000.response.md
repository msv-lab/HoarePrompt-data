Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length such that 1 <= |`s`| <= 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, while the conditions for `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
