Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not correct because it only considers forming squares (polygons with 4 sides) for each unique stick length. However, the problem statement asks to find the maximum number of regular polygons of any number of sides (not just squares) that can be formed from the given sticks.

For example, in the fourth test case, the program will output `0` because it only checks for squares, but it is possible to form a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4, resulting in the correct output of `2`.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should consider forming polygons with any number of sides, starting from triangles (3 sides) up to the maximum possible number of sides given the count of each stick length.
