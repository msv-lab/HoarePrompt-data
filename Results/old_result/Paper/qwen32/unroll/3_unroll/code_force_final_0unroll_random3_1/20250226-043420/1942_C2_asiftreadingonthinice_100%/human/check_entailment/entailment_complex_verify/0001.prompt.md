You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of chosen vertices on a line of `n` vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that represents the maximum number of additional vertices Bessie can choose, given the constraints of `x` (the number of initially chosen vertices), `y` (an additional parameter affecting the calculation), and the specific positions of the initially chosen vertices. The final output for each test case is the minimum of the calculated value and `n - 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides, where some vertices `x` are already chosen. We need to choose up to `y` additional vertices to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed by drawing diagonals between these vertices.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Sorting the chosen vertices.
2. Calculating the gaps between consecutive vertices and handling the gap between the first and last vertices.
3. If the gap between two vertices is 2, it directly contributes to forming an additional triangle.
4. If the gap is even, it calculates the number of additional vertices that can be added to form triangles and stores these values.
5. It then sorts these values and tries to use the additional vertices `y` to maximize the number of triangles.
6. Finally, it prints the minimum of the calculated answer and `n-2` (since the maximum number of triangles in a polygon with `n` sides is `n-2`).

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Gaps**: The solution correctly identifies gaps of 2 and even gaps but does not account for all possible configurations that could maximize the number of triangles. For example, if there are multiple even gaps, the solution might not optimally use the `y` additional vertices to form the maximum number of triangles.
2. **Sorting and Using Additional Vertices**: The sorting and usage of additional vertices to form triangles seems correct, but the logic might not cover all edge cases, especially when `y` is large and can be used to fill multiple gaps optimally.
3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not explicitly handle edge cases like when `x` is very small or when `y` is zero.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem's complexity and the need for optimal placement of additional vertices to maximize triangles, the provided solution might not handle all cases optimally. While it captures some key aspects, it may not be fully correct for all possible inputs within the problem constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
