To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube at a time. The goal is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Points:
1. **Adding and Removing Cubes:** Since Nikita can add or remove one cube at a time, the net effect of `n` moves can be any integer between `-n` (if he removes a cube every time) and `+n` (if he adds a cube every time).
2. **Parity Consideration:** The difference `n - m` must be non-negative and even for it to be possible to reach exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move changes the count of cubes by 1, and thus the total change after `n` moves must be an integer that can be achieved by a combination of additions and subtractions of 1.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the logic described in the problem:
- It reads the number of test cases `kreker`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
