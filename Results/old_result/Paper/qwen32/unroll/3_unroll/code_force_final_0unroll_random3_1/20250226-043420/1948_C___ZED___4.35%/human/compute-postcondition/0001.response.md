To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the code for each test case and how it affects the output.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n` is the length of the strings `a` and `b`.
     - `a` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>'.
     - The code checks if the second last character of `b` is not '>', and if so, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it checks if all characters at even indices in `b` are '>'.
     - If not, it then checks if all characters at odd indices (except the last one) in `a` are '>'.
     - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

2. **Output State:**
   - The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions mentioned above.
   - The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are modified during each iteration of the loop, but the final output state is determined by the printed results for each test case.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case.

Output State: **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the code.**
