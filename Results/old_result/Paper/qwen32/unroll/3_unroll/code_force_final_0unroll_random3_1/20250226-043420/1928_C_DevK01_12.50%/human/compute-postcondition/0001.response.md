The code snippet calculates the square root of `q` and assigns it to the variable `w`. No other variables are modified by this code. The initial state specifies that `q` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `M` is an empty list. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases such that 1 <= q <= 100, `w` is the square root of `q`, and `M` is an empty list.**
