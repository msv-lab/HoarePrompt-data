Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that might cause it to not work correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Handling of Cycles**: The program correctly identifies cycles in the permutation for both Bodya and Sasha. However, it does not handle the situation where the number of turns \( k \) is very large compared to the length of the cycle. Specifically, if \( k \) is large, the players might stay in a cycle for a long time, and the program should account for the sum of the cycle values multiplied by the number of complete cycles they can make within \( k \) turns, plus the sum of the values for the remaining turns.

2. **Maximizing Score Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum score by iterating through the path and considering the score for staying in the same position for each turn. However, it does not consider the possibility of moving to the next position in the permutation and then staying there for the remaining turns. This means that the program might not be correctly calculating the maximum score for each player.

3. **Cycle Handling**: Although the program identifies cycles, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the player might enter a cycle and then stay within that cycle for the remaining turns. The program should calculate the sum of the cycle values and multiply it by the number of complete cycles within \( k \) turns, and then add the sum of the values for the remaining turns.

To fix these issues, the program should be updated to correctly handle cycles and maximize the score for each player by considering both staying in the same position and moving to the next position in the permutation.

Here is a potential corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, pb, ps = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (pathb, paths) = ([], [])
        vis = [0] * n
        vis[pb - 1] = 1
        while True:
            pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
            if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
                break
        vis = [0] * n
        vis[ps - 1] = 1
        while True:
            paths.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
            if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
                break
        (resb, ress) = (0, 0)
        (preb, pres) = (0, 0)
        (cycle_start_b, cycle_start_s) = (pathb.index(a[pb - 1]), paths.index(a[ps - 1]))
        (cycle_b, cycle_s) = (pathb[cycle_start_b:], paths[cycle_start_s:])
        (cycle_len_b, cycle_len_s) = (len(cycle_b), len(cycle_s))
        (cycle_sum_b, cycle_sum_s) = (sum(cycle_b), sum(cycle_s))
        for i in range(len(pathb)):
            if k < i + 1:
                break
            curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
            preb += pathb[i]
            resb = max(resb, curr)
        for i in range(len(paths)):
            if k < i + 1:
                break
            curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
            pres += paths[i]
            ress = max(ress, curr)
        if k >= len(pathb):
            resb += (k - len(pathb)) // cycle_len_b * cycle_sum_b + sum(cycle_b[:(k - len(pathb)) % cycle_len_b])
        if k >= len(paths):
            ress += (k - len(paths)) // cycle_len_s * cycle_sum_s + sum(cycle_s[:(k - len(paths)) % cycle_len_s])
        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

This corrected version addresses the issues of handling cycles and maximizing the score for each player.
