Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k`, `x`, and `a` are each test case consisting of three integers where 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. There are t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is now an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain as described in the initial state, with no changes to their constraints or values.
