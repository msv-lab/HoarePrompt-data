Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program only checks for the number of squares that can be formed (i.e., polygons with 4 equal sides). However, the problem description asks for the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons of any number of sides, not just squares. The code does not consider polygons with 3, 5, 6, or any other number of sides.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
We can form a regular hexagon with side length 2 using all six sticks. However, the given program will output `0` because it only checks for squares and there are not enough sticks to form a square (which requires 4 sticks).

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the general case of forming polygons with any number of sides.
