Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic `m // a + m // b + 2` does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods or the periodic launches of fireworks from both installations.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the launch intervals `a` and `b`, and then determine how many fireworks from each installation can be in the sky at the same time during one LCM period. The correct approach involves iterating over the LCM period and counting the overlapping fireworks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        
        for t in range(lcm):
            count = 0
            if t % a <= m:
                count += (m - t % a) // a + 1
            if t % b <= m:
                count += (m - t % b) // b + 1
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by iterating through one LCM period and counting the number of fireworks from both installations that are visible at each time `t` within that period.
