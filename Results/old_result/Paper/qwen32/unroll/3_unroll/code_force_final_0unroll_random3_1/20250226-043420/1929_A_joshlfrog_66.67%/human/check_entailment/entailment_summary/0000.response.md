Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in an optimal way. To maximize the beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the sum of all consecutive differences after optimal rearrangement. The correct approach should involve sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, in the first test case of the problem description, the array [2, 1, 3] can be rearranged to [1, 2, 3], and the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 2. The program, however, would output 3 - 1 = 2, which is coincidentally correct for this specific test case but does not generalize to other cases.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
