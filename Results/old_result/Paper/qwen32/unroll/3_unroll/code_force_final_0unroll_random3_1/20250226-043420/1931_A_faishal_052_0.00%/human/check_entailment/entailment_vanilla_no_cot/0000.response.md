Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. Here are the issues with the program:

1. The logic for determining the letters is flawed. The program attempts to fill the first two letters with the maximum possible values (26) if the remaining sum is greater than 52, but this does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest solution.

2. The sorting of the array `arr` after filling it with values does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word. The goal is to construct the word in such a way that the first letter is as small as possible, then the second, and so on.

3. The program does not handle the edge cases correctly, such as when the sum is exactly 3 (which should result in "aaa").

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the word with 'a's (which is the smallest possible)
        a = b = c = 1
        # Try to increase the letters from the end to make the word lexicographically smallest
        if lex - 3 >= 26:
            c = 26
            lex -= 26
        if lex - 2 >= 26:
            b = 26
            lex -= 26
        a = lex - 1
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the letters are assigned in such a way that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.
