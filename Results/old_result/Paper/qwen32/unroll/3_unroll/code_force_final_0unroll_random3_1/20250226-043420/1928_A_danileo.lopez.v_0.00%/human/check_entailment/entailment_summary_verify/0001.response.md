### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the logic needed to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut. The key insight is that if at least one of the dimensions (a or b) is even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting along that dimension and rearranging the resulting pieces. If both dimensions are odd, he cannot form a new rectangle because the resulting pieces will not allow for a rearrangement into a different rectangle with integer sides.

The provided function summary aligns with this reasoning. It states that the function checks if at least one of the dimensions is even and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This matches the logic described in the problem and the original assessment.

Let's verify the function with a few test cases to ensure it behaves as expected:

1. **Test Case: a = 1, b = 1**
   - Both dimensions are odd.
   - Expected output: "No"
   - Function output: "No" (correct)

2. **Test Case: a = 2, b = 1**
   - One dimension is even.
   - Expected output: "Yes"
   - Function output: "Yes" (correct)

3. **Test Case: a = 2, b = 6**
   - One dimension is even.
   - Expected output: "Yes"
   - Function output: "Yes" (correct)

4. **Test Case: a = 3, b = 2**
   - One dimension is even.
   - Expected output: "Yes"
   - Function output: "Yes" (correct)

5. **Test Case: a = 2, b = 2**
   - Both dimensions are even.
   - Expected output: "Yes"
   - Function output: "Yes" (correct)

6. **Test Case: a = 2, b = 4**
   - Both dimensions are even.
   - Expected output: "Yes"
   - Function output: "Yes" (correct)

7. **Test Case: a = 6, b = 3**
   - One dimension is even.
   - Expected output: "Yes"
   - Function output: "Yes" (correct)

All test cases match the expected outputs, confirming that the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem and the original assessment.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
