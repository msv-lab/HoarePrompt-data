The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations needed to ensure that the smallest element in the list is greater than the median of the list. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for the corresponding test case.
