### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to understand whether the original assessment is correct or not.

#### Problem Recap:
- An array is "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= |a| - 1`), such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`, and replace `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.
- We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. If it's impossible, we return `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Check if all elements are the same:**
   ```python
   aa = set(a)
   if len(aa) == 1:
       print(-1)
   ```
   - This part is correct. If all elements are the same, the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements.

2. **Count consecutive elements:**
   ```python
   cnt = 0
   ans = n
   for i in range(n):
       if a[i] == tmp:
           cnt += 1
       else:
           ans = min(ans, cnt)
           cnt = 0
   ans = min(ans, cnt)
   print(ans)
   ```
   - The program tries to find the smallest contiguous subarray of elements that are the same as the first element (`tmp`).
   - It then prints the size of this smallest subarray as the answer.

#### Evaluation:
- The program's logic is flawed because it only considers contiguous subarrays of the first element and does not account for the general case of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
- The program does not consider the possibility of removing elements that are not necessarily contiguous or not necessarily the first element.
- The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

#### Counterexamples:
1. **Test Case:**
   ```
   3
   5
   1 2 3 2 1
   ```
   - Correct output: `2` (remove `3` and one of the `2`s).
   - Program output: `1` (incorrect).

2. **Test Case:**
   ```
   5
   5
   1 3 3 3 1
   ```
   - Correct output: `2` (remove `3`s).
   - Program output: `1` (incorrect).

Given these counterexamples and the flawed logic in the program, the original assessment appears to be correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect based on the problem requirements and the provided counterexamples.
