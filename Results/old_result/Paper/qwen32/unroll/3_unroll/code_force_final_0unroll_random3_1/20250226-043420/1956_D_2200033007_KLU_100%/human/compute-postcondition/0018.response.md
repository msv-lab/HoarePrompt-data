Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, indicating that not all elements in the subarray from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` satisfy `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. The element `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`. The list `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` and any changes made by the recursive call `make_stairs(i - 1)` to `res`.**

In simpler terms, the function `make_stairs` has been called recursively with `i - 1`, and the list `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`. The values of `i`, `start_index`, `is_already_stairs`, and the condition that `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` remain unchanged. Any further modifications to `res` would be due to the recursive call `make_stairs(i - 1)`.
