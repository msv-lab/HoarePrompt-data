### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step, using the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Key Observations:
- Each move changes the number of cubes by Â±1.
- Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes can only be an integer that is `n` moves away from the initial state (0 cubes), i.e., the number of cubes can be any integer `k` such that `|k| <= n`.
- To have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, `m` must be reachable from 0 in `n` moves. This means `m` must be within the range `[-n, n]`.
- Additionally, since each move changes the number of cubes by 1, the parity (oddness or evenness) of the number of cubes must match the parity of `n`. Specifically, `m` and `n` must have the same parity (both odd or both even) because an even number of moves can only change the parity of the number of cubes an even number of times, and an odd number of moves can only change the parity an odd number of times.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `kreker` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`.

- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity.
- The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n` (since `m` cannot be greater than `n` moves away from 0).

#### Annotations and Validation:
The annotations provide a detailed state of the program before and after the function call. The annotations state that the program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` and prints "Yes" if true and "No" otherwise. This aligns with the program's logic.

However, let's validate the conditions:
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that `n` and `m` have the same parity.
- `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n`.

The condition `n - m >= 0` can be interpreted as `m <= n`, which is correct because `m` cannot be greater than `n` moves away from 0. The original assessment correctly notes that `m` is guaranteed to be non-negative, so `n - m >= 0` effectively ensures `m <= n` in this context.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct. It checks both necessary conditions: the parity of `n` and `m` must be the same, and `m` must be within the range of possible moves (`m <= n`).

### Final: **True**
