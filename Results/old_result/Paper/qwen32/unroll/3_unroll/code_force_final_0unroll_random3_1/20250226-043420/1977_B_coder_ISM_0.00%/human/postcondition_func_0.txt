The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x`, processes its binary representation, and outputs the modified binary representation along with its length. The modification involves replacing consecutive '1's with a '-1' and '1', and adjusting the binary string based on specific rules to ensure no consecutive '1's remain, except for the special case of a trailing '1' after a '-1'.
