You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
Polycarp encodes a string `s` by:
1. Creating a sorted string `r` of all distinct characters in `s`.
2. Replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

Decoding involves reversing this process:
1. Given the encoded string `b`, we need to determine the original string `s`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that attempts to decode the string `b`:
1. It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the mapping from characters in `r` to characters in `b`.
2. It iterates over each character in `b`.
3. If the character is already in `mapping`, it appends the corresponding original character to `decoded`.
4. If the character is not in `mapping`, it finds the next unused character in the alphabet and maps it to the current character in `b`.
5. It appends the found character to `decoded`.
6. Finally, it joins the list `decoded` into a string and returns it.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly determine the symmetric character from `r` for each character in `b`. Instead, it attempts to map characters from `b` to the next unused character in the alphabet, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should be:
1. Determine the set of distinct characters in `b`.
2. Sort these characters to form `r`.
3. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
4. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

### Correct Approach:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Determine the set of distinct characters in `encoded`
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from each character in `distinct_chars` to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {}
    n = len(distinct_chars)
    for i in range(n):
        mapping[distinct_chars[i]] = distinct_chars[n - i - 1]
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string `encoded` using the mapping
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly decode the string `b` because it does not create the correct mapping from characters in `b` to their symmetric counterparts in `r`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
