Output State: **After executing the loop for all test cases, the output will consist of 't' lines, each containing either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on whether the dimensions of the rectangle in the corresponding test case have at least one even number. The state of variables 'a' and 'b' will reflect the last test case's dimensions processed by the loop, and 't' will remain unchanged.**
