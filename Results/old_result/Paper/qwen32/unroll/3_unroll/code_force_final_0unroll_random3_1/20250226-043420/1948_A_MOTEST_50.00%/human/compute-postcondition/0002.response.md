`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**.
