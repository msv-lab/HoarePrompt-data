You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        low = 0
        high = n
        ans = -1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if func_1(mid, a, b, n):
                ans = mid
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        print(ans)

def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)



- Function Summary: 
The function takes four integer parameters `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, with the constraints that 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. It calculates a value based on these parameters and returns True if this calculated value is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The function `func_1` does not properly compute the profit for a given `k`, and the binary search logic is not correctly implemented for this problem.

The function `func_1(k, a, b, n)` calculates the total revenue for a given `k` but does not compare it against the revenue for other values of `k`. Instead, it checks if the total revenue is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition to determine the maximum profit.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to compute the profit for each possible value of `k` (from 0 to n) and choose the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. Here's the corrected approach:

1. For each `k` from 0 to n, calculate the total revenue:
   - Revenue from selling the first `k` buns at modified prices: `sum(b - i for i in range(k))`
   - Revenue from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price: `(n - k) * a`
   - Total revenue for this `k`: `sum(b - i for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a`

2. Track the maximum revenue obtained from all possible values of `k`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum profit by evaluating all possible values of `k` and selecting the one that yields the highest profit. The original provided code does not do this and hence is incorrect.
