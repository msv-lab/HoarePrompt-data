#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where the first two characters (hh) represent the hour from 00 to 23 and the last two characters (mm) represent the minute from 00 to 59.

    #State: For each of the t test cases, the time is printed in a 12-hour format with AM or PM, where the hour is adjusted accordingly and minutes remain the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string in 24-hour format, converts it to a 12-hour format with AM or PM, and prints the converted time. The minutes remain unchanged, and the hour is adjusted accordingly.
