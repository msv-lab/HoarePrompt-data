You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Kirill aims to be among the first `m` people in a queue of `n` people by bribing others. Each person `i` in the queue has two costs: `a_i` (cost to directly swap with Kirill) and `b_i` (cost to pass through person `i` to swap with someone else). Kirill can perform swaps multiple times and wants to minimize the total cost.

### Key Points

1. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people.
2. **Constraints**: Kirill can bribe people by paying `a_i` to swap directly or `b_i` to pass through.
3. **Strategy**: The program should calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position `j` such that `j < m`.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**: The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

3. **Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The program initializes `total` to 0 and `best` to a very large value.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue (`na_frente` to 0) towards the front.
   - For each person `v`:
     - If `v` is within the first `m` positions (`v <= pos_final`), it checks if the cost of swapping directly with Kirill (`total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost (`best`). If so, it updates `best`.
     - It then adds the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If `v` is not within the first `m` positions, it still adds the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the best cost found for each test case.

### Issues with the Program

The main issue with this program is the logic for calculating the minimum cost. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Kirill needs to pass through multiple people to reach a position within the first `m` positions. The current logic does not account for the optimal sequence of swaps and passes that would minimize the total cost.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers the optimal sequence of swaps and passes to minimize the total cost while ensuring Kirill reaches a position within the first `m` positions.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the program's logic, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
