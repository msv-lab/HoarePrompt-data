Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a typo in the output string for the "STAIR" condition. The program prints 'STAIRS' instead of 'STAIR'. This means that even though the logic for determining if the digits form a stair, peak, or neither is correct, the output for the stair condition is incorrect.

To fix the code, the line:
```python
if a < b < c:
    print('STAIRS')
```
should be changed to:
```python
if a < b < c:
    print('STAIR')
```

This change ensures that the program outputs the correct string for the stair condition as specified in the problem description.
