You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. However, there are several issues that make the program incorrect:

1. The program uses `map(str, input().split(':'))` to split the input time into hours and minutes. This is correct, but it then proceeds to handle each hour individually using a series of if-elif statements. This is inefficient and error-prone.

2. The program does not handle leading zeros correctly for the hours between 1 and 9 in the 12-hour format. For example, when converting 01:00, it should output "01:00 AM" but the logic provided will output "1:00 AM" (without the leading zero).

3. The logic for converting hours from 13 to 23 is correct, but the way it is implemented is repetitive and could be simplified using arithmetic operations.

4. The program does not correctly handle the conversion of 00:00 to 12:00 AM, which is a special case.

5. The program uses `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')` to format the output. This will add a space before the 'AM' or 'PM' which is not required according to the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not handle all cases properly and does not format the output correctly.
