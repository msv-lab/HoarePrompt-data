To determine the output state, we need to understand how the loop executes for each test case. The loop reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then prints specific pairs of numbers based on the value of `n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the integer `n` is read.
3. The first two lines printed are always `1, 1` and `1, 2`.
4. The inner loop runs from `3` to `n` (inclusive), printing `i, i` for each `i` in this range.

Let's consider the output for a few test cases to understand the pattern:

- **Test Case 1: n = 3**
  - Output: 
    ```
    1, 1
    1, 2
    3, 3
    ```

- **Test Case 2: n = 4**
  - Output:
    ```
    1, 1
    1, 2
    3, 3
    4, 4
    ```

- **Test Case 3: n = 5**
  - Output:
    ```
    1, 1
    1, 2
    3, 3
    4, 4
    5, 5
    ```

From the above examples, we can see that for each test case, the output consists of:
- The first two lines are always `1, 1` and `1, 2`.
- Followed by lines `i, i` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n`.

The output state after all test cases have been processed is simply the concatenation of the outputs of each individual test case.

Output State: **For each test case with input integer `n`, the output will be `1, 1`, `1, 2`, and then `i, i` for each `i` from `3` to `n`.**
