Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is flawed.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
        print(2)
        return
print(3)
```

The intention is to check if there is a triplet of friends (i, v[i], v[v[i]]) that forms a cycle, which would allow Monocarp to invite just 2 friends to have at least 2 of them come to the party. However, this logic is too simplistic and does not cover all scenarios where fewer than 3 invitations are necessary.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In this case, the friendships form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1. By inviting friends 1 and 2, both 1 and 2 will come to the party because 1's best friend (2) and 2's best friend (3) are invited. However, the program will incorrectly print 3 because it does not detect this cycle correctly.

The program only checks for a specific type of cycle (i, v[i], v[v[i]] == i), which is not sufficient to cover all cases where fewer than 3 invitations are needed. For example, in the counterexample above, the program would not recognize that inviting friends 1 and 2 is sufficient.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for some inputs, and the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
