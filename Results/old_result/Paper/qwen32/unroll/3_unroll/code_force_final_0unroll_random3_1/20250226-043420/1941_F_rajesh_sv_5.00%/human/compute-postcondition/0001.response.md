In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `testcases`, which is the value returned by the function `func_3()`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `testcases`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, the only variable we need to consider adjusting is `testcases`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `testcases` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `testcases` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `testcases` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than or equal to 1**
