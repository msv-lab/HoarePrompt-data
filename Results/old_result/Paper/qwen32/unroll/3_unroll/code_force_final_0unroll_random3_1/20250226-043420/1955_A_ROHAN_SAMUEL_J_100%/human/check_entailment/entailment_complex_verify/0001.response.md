Let's analyze the program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Program Breakdown and Annotations

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given the prices `a` (for one yogurt) and `b` (for two yogurts under promotion). Here's the logic broken down:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Odd `n`**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2` is not zero):
     - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying each yogurt individually).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying `n // 2` pairs at `b` and one yogurt individually at `a`).

3. **Logic for Even `n`**:
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2` is zero):
     - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying each yogurt individually).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying `n // 2` pairs at `b`).

### Annotations

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and summarize the logic correctly. The annotations confirm the steps outlined above.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `n` is even.
   - Since `2 * a = 10` and `b = 9`, buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper.
   - Cost = `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `n` is odd.
   - Since `2 * a = 10` and `b = 9`, buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper.
   - Cost = `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `n` is odd.
   - Since `2 * a = 10` and `b = 11`, buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
   - Cost = `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `n` is even.
   - Since `2 * a = 10` and `b = 11`, buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
   - Cost = `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. The annotations align with the logic and the program produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
