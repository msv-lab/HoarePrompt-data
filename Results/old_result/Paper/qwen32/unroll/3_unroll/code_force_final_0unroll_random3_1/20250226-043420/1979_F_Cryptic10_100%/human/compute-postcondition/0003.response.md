Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any input arguments. It interacts through standard input to read an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the number of vertices in a graph. The function performs no more than `n` queries of the form "? d" to determine a Hamiltonian path in the graph. It does not return any value directly but outputs the Hamiltonian path through standard output.**
