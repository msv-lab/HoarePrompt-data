You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    #State: For each test case with given `n` and `k`, the `answer` list will be constructed by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the initial array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` will remain unchanged except for `answer` being updated for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the initial list `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` and prints the resulting list. The function does not return any value; it outputs the result directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation for every test case as described in the problem statement.

### Program Analysis:
The program constructs a permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers. Specifically:
1. It initializes the permutation with the smallest number (1).
2. It then alternates between adding the next smallest and the next largest number from the remaining numbers.

Here is the provided code for reference:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)
```

### Example Analysis:
Let's examine the example cases provided in the problem statement.

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** `2 2`
- **Output:** `2 1`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 2 are `[2+1] = [3]`. The difference is `0`, which satisfies the condition.

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** `3 2`
- **Output:** `1 3 2`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 2 are `[1+3] = [4]` and `[3+2] = [5]`. The difference is `1`, which satisfies the condition.

#### Example 3:
- **Input:** `10 4`
- **Output:** `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 4 are `[1+8+4+10] = [23]`, `[8+4+10+2] = [24]`, `[4+10+2+7] = [23]`, `[10+2+7+5] = [24]`, `[2+7+5+9] = [23]`, `[7+5+9+3] = [24]`, `[5+9+3+6] = [23]`. The difference is `1`, which satisfies the condition.

#### Example 4:
- **Input:** `13 4`
- **Output:** `4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 4 are `[4+10+1+13] = [28]`, `[10+1+13+5] = [29]`, `[1+13+5+9] = [28]`, `[13+5+9+2] = [29]`, `[5+9+2+12] = [28]`, `[9+2+12+6] = [29]`, `[2+12+6+8] = [28]`, `[12+6+8+3] = [29]`, `[6+8+3+11] = [28]`, `[8+3+11+7] = [29]`. The difference is `1`, which satisfies the condition.

#### Example 5:
- **Input:** `7 4`
- **Output:** `1 6 3 7 2 5 4`
- **Explanation:** The sums of the segments of length 4 are `[1+6+3+7] = [17]`, `[6+3+7+2] = [18]`, `[3+7+2+5] = [17]`, `[7+2+5+4] = [18]`. The difference is `1`, which satisfies the condition.

### General Case Analysis:
The program constructs a permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers. This approach ensures that the sums of the segments of length `k` are as balanced as possible. Since `k` is even, the alternating pattern helps to distribute the sums evenly, ensuring that the maximum and minimum sums differ by no more than 1.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the example cases and the general approach of the program, it appears that the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for every test case as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly handle the construction of k-level permutations for all test cases, ensuring that the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
