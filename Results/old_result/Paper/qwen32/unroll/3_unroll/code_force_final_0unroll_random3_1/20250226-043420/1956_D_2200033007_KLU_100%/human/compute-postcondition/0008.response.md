Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `arr[start_index]` is `1`.**

This means that the element at `arr[start_index]` has been set to `1`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
