To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the loop's behavior:

1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. In each iteration:
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from the `data` list at index `idx` and converted to integers.
   - `arr` is extracted from the `data` list at index `idx + 1` and converted to a list of integers.
   - A tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is appended to the `test_cases` list.
   - The index `idx` is incremented by 2 to move to the next test case's data.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are initially defined with specific values, but these values are overwritten in each iteration of the loop.
- `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is initially an empty list.
- `idx` starts at 1.

After the loop completes:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` will contain `t` tuples, each representing a test case with its respective `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- `idx` will be `1 + 2*t` because it was incremented by 2 in each of the `t` iterations.

The output state will be:
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will hold the values from the last test case processed by the loop, but these are not preserved outside the loop.
- `test_cases` will hold all the test cases processed.
- `idx` will be `1 + 2*t`.

Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the last test case processed, `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing all test cases, and `idx` is `1 + 2*t`.**
