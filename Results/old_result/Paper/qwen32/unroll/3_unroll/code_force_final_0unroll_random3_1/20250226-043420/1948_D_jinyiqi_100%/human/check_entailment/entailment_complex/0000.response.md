### Reasoning:

The program is designed to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing each question mark in the string with a lowercase Latin letter. The function `func_1` processes each test case by iterating over possible lengths of the tandem repeat (from the maximum possible half-length down to 1) and checking if a valid tandem repeat can be formed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **String Processing**: For each test case, the string `s` is converted into a list of characters.
3. **Tandem Repeat Check**: The program iterates over possible half-lengths of the tandem repeat (from `n // 2` down to 1). For each half-length `j`, it checks if there is a substring of length `2*j` that can be a tandem repeat.
4. **Character Matching**: For each possible starting position `k` of the substring, it checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k+j` are either the same or one of them is a question mark. If this condition holds for `j` consecutive pairs, it means a valid tandem repeat of length `2*j` can be formed.
5. **Output**: If a valid tandem repeat is found, the program prints its length (`2*j`) and exits the function. If no valid tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, it prints `0`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**: The logic seems correct given the problem constraints. The program efficiently checks for the longest possible tandem repeat by starting from the maximum possible half-length and working downwards. It correctly handles the replacement of question marks by considering them as potential matches.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as strings consisting entirely of question marks, strings without any question marks, and strings that cannot form any tandem repeats.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
