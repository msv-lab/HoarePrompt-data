Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly but then processes it incorrectly.
2. The line `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the array.
3. The line `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first chip from the right (which is the last chip in the original array).
4. The line `z = arr[x:n - y]` is intended to extract a substring containing the chips and free cells between the first and last chip. However, the slicing is incorrect. `n - y` is not the correct endpoint for the slice.
5. The line `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells within the incorrectly sliced substring, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of moves required to form a contiguous block.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Identify the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips.
- Count the number of free cells within the range defined by the leftmost and rightmost chips.
- The result is the number of free cells within this range, as each free cell will require one move to be filled with a chip.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input('').split()))
        left = arr.index(1)  # Find the first chip
        right = len(arr) - 1 - arr[::-1].index(1)  # Find the last chip
        free_cells_between = arr[left:right + 1].count(0)  # Count free cells between the first and last chip
        print(free_cells_between)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version should produce the correct output for the given problem.
