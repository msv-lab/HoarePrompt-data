You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score for the described problem. The logic for calculating the answer when `k < n * m` is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the counts of the cards and calculates the score.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
else:
    k -= n * m
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
    ans = a[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
```

The issue lies in the way the program updates the counts of the cards and calculates the score. The program attempts to distribute the remaining `k` cards to maximize the score, but the logic for doing this is incorrect. The calculation `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` and the subsequent multiplication to compute `ans` are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the distribution of the `k` new cards results in the counts of the cards being as equal as possible, which maximizes the number of permutations of length `n` that can be formed. The correct approach involves using a greedy strategy to distribute the `k` cards and then calculating the score based on the resulting counts.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        m = min(a)
        ans = 0
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            a = [x - m for x in a]  # Normalize the counts
            for i in range(n):
                if k > 0:
                    add = min(k, n - a[i])
                    a[i] += add
                    k -= add
            ans = 1
            for count in a:
                ans *= count + 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

In this corrected version, we first normalize the counts by subtracting the minimum count `m` from each count. We then distribute the remaining `k` cards to maximize the counts. Finally, we calculate the score based on the resulting counts. This ensures that the program correctly calculates the maximum score for every potential case.
