Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, then it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This part is correct.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, then it's optimal to sell all buns at the modified price, starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`. The formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` correctly computes the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`. This part is also correct.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, then it's optimal to sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where `k = b - a`, and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`. The program calculates the profit from the first `k` buns as `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` and adds `a * n` for the remaining buns. However, this approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the first `k` buns are sold at prices from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, not from `b - a` down to `1`.

To fix the program, we need to compute the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series correctly and add the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = b - a
            if k >= n:
                # Sell all buns at modified price
                print((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)
            else:
                # Sell first k buns at modified price, remaining at usual price
                modified_profit = (b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2
                usual_profit = a * (n - k)
                print(modified_profit + usual_profit)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles all cases and computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain.
