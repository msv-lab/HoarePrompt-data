Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the shortest contiguous subarray that contains all elements equal to the first element of the array `a`. If all elements in the array are the same, the program correctly outputs `-1` since it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

However, the logic in the program is flawed. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful, which means breaking the condition that allows the array to be transformed into an array of identical numbers using the specified operation. The provided program does not address this requirement correctly.

For example, in the fourth test case:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The program would output `3` because it finds the shortest contiguous subarray of `3`s at the beginning, which is of length `3`. However, to make the array not beautiful, we need to remove the `5` and two of the `3`s around it, making the correct answer `3`. But the logic of the program does not account for breaking the beauty condition by removing elements that would allow the array to still be transformed into an array of identical numbers.

The correct approach would involve checking the structure of the array and determining the minimum number of removals required to disrupt the pattern that allows the array to be transformed into an array of identical numbers.

Correctness: **False**
