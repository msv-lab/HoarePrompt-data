To understand the output state of the given loop, we need to analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Loop Execution**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers.
3. **Initialization**: Variables `same`, `num`, and `minn` are initialized. `same` keeps track of the count of consecutive identical elements, `num` stores the current number being compared, and `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`).
4. **While Loop**: The inner loop iterates through the list `ar` starting from the second element:
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, `i` is incremented (to skip the next element), `num` is updated to the new element, `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.
   - `i` is incremented again to move to the next element.
5. **Final Update**: After the while loop, `minn` is updated one last time to ensure the minimum count of consecutive identical elements is captured.
6. **Output**: If `minn` is still infinity (which means the list was empty or improperly processed), `-1` is printed. Otherwise, `minn` (the minimum count of consecutive identical elements) is printed.

**Output State**: After all iterations of the loop, the output state will be a series of integers, each representing the minimum count of consecutive identical elements for each test case.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the minimum count of consecutive identical elements for each test case.**
