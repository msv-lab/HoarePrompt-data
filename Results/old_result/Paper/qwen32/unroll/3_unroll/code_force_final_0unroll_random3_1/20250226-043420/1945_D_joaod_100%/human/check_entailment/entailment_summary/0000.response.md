### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the queue from the end to the beginning and calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position among the first `m` people in line. However, the logic in the program does not correctly account for the requirement to minimize the total cost by considering all possible swaps and passes.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the total cost when swapping positions. The cost should be updated only when a swap actually happens, and the cost of passing through people should be added only when Kirill moves past them without swapping.

2. **Logic for Best Cost**: The variable `best` is supposed to hold the minimum cost to reach a position among the first `m` people. However, the logic to update `best` is flawed. The program incorrectly adds `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` even when Kirill does not need to pass through that person.

3. **Handling of Positions**: The program decrements `na_frente` and `pos_final` by 1, which is correct if the positions are 1-based. However, the logic for handling positions and costs needs to correctly reflect the requirement to minimize the total cost by choosing the optimal swaps.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position among the first `m` people. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
