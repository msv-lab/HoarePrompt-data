The `print(0)` statement in the given code snippet will print the integer `0` regardless of the values of `x` and `y`. The initial state provides conditions on the values of `x` and `y`, but these conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement, which is explicitly printing the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
