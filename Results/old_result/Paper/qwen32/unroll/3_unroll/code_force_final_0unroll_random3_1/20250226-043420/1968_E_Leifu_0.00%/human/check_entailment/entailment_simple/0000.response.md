Let's analyze the given program and its correctness based on the problem description and the provided comments.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of `n` cells in an `n x n` grid. The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `n`. It then prints specific points based on the value of `n`:
- For `n = 2`, it prints the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
- For `n = 3`, it prints the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
- For `n >= 4`, it prints the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for each `j` from `4` to `n`.

### Evaluation:
Let's evaluate the correctness of the program for each given case:

1. **For `n = 2`**:
   - Points: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - Distances: `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0`, `|1-1| + |2-2| = 0`, `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`.
   - Distinct distances: `{0, 1}`.
   - Size of `H`: 2.
   - **Correct**: The size of `H` is maximized.

2. **For `n = 3`**:
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
   - Distances: `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0`, `|1-1| + |2-2| = 0`, `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`, `|1-1| + |2-3| = 2`, `|1-2| + |2-3| = 2`, `|2-2| + |3-3| = 0`.
   - Distinct distances: `{0, 1, 2}`.
   - Size of `H`: 3.
   - **Correct**: The size of `H` is maximized.

3. **For `n >= 4`**:
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for each `j` from `4` to `n`.
   - The points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` create distances `0` and `1`.
   - The points `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)` create a distance of `4`.
   - The points `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)` create a distance of `3`.
   - The points `(2, 4)` and `(j, j)` create distances that increase as `j` increases, contributing to a larger set of distinct distances.
   - The points `(j, j)` for `j >= 4` are on the diagonal, and their pairwise distances are `2(j-k)` for `j > k`, contributing to a larger set of distinct distances.
   - **Correct**: The pattern ensures a large set of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly prints points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates and prints the points that maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for each test case.
Correctness: **True**
