Given the initial state, we have the following variables:

- `mex`: a list of `n` integers.
- `minn`: the final value after all increments.
- `maxx`: the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered during the loop.

However, the provided Python code snippet contains an empty `print()` statement:

```python
print()
```

An empty `print()` statement in Python outputs a newline character. Therefore, it does not print any of the variables `mex`, `minn`, or `maxx`.

Output: **(newline)**
