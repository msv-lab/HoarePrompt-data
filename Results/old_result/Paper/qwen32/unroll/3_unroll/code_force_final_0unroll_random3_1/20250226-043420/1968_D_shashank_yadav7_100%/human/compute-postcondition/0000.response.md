Output State: **t is an input integer, such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all 1 <= i <= n. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input. The other variables and their constraints remain unchanged.
