You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: t is the integer input provided such that 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are the integers from the last iteration of the loop such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIRS' if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, prints 'PEAK' if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, and prints 'NONE' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if the digits form a stair by verifying the condition `a < b < c`. If true, it prints "STAIRS".
4. It checks if the digits form a peak by verifying the condition `a < b > c`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
5. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

However, there is a mistake in the program. The output string for the stair condition is "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR". According to the problem description, the correct output should be "STAIR" when `a < b < c`.

Correctness: **False**
