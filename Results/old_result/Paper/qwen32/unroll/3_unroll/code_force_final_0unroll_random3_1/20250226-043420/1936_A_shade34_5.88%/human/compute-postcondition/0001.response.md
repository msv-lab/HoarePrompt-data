To understand the output state, let's break down the provided code and its behavior.

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the following steps are performed.

2. **Inner Loop (Finding `mak`)**: The first inner loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. It compares the current `mak` with each `i` using the query `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`. Based on the response (`<`), it updates `mak` to `i` if `mak < i`.

   - After this loop, `mak` holds the index of the largest element in the permutation `p`.

3. **Second Inner Loop (Finding `mak2` and `pans`)**: The second inner loop runs `n` times. It compares the current `mak` with each `i` using the query `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.

   - If the response is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and resets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the response is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`.

   - After this loop, `mak` holds the index of the largest element in the permutation `p` again, and `pans` contains all indices of elements that are equal to the largest element.

4. **Third Inner Loop (Finding the smallest among `pans`)**: The third inner loop runs from `1` to `len(pans)-1`. It compares the current `mak` in `pans` with each `i` in `pans` using the query `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`.

   - If the response is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

   - After this loop, `mak` holds the index of the smallest element among those that are equal to the largest element.

5. **Final Output**: The final output is `print('!', mak2, mak)`, where `mak2` is the index of the largest element in the permutation `p`, and `mak` is the index of the smallest among the largest elements.

Given the above explanation, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **mak2 is the index of the largest element in the permutation p, and mak is the index of the smallest among the largest elements.**
