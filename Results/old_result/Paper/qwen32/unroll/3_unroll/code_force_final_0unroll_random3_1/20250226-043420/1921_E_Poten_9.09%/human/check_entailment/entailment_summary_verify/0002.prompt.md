You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads a number of test cases and for each test case, it processes six integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle and the coordinates of two points within that rectangle. It then determines and prints whether a player named Alice or Bob wins or if the game is a Draw based on the positions of the points and the rules defined in the code.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the provided problem description. Let's break down the logic and compare it with the expected behavior.

### Key Points of the Game:
1. **Alice's Moves**: Down, Down-Right, Down-Left.
2. **Bob's Moves**: Up, Up-Right, Up-Left.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they place their chip on the same cell as the other player's chip.
4. **Draw Condition**: If either player cannot make a move (Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row).

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one to determine the game's outcome. Let's examine the logic in the program:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `x_a > x_b` (Alice's row is greater than Bob's row) or `h == 1` (only one row), the program outputs "Draw". This is generally correct because if Alice starts below Bob or there's only one row, Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, leading to a draw.
   
2. **Row Parity Check**:
   - The program checks if both `x_a` and `x_b` are either even or both are odd. If so, it further checks the column positions (`y_a` and `y_b`):
     - If `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins. This is correct because Alice and Bob are on the same column, and Bob can always move up to meet Alice.
     - If `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b`, it checks the distance between the columns and the number of rows between them to determine if either player can force a win or if it will be a draw. The logic here is complex and needs careful verification.
   
3. **Column Parity Check**:
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities, the program checks the column positions (`y_a` and `y_b`):
     - If `y_a == y_b`, Alice wins. This is correct because Alice can always move down to meet Bob.
     - If `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b`, it checks the distance between the columns and the number of rows between them to determine if either player can force a win or if it will be a draw. The logic here is also complex and needs careful verification.

### Issues and Corrections:
The provided program seems to have logical errors in the conditions and calculations for determining the winner when `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity or different parities. Specifically:

- The conditions for determining the winner based on the distance between columns and rows are not correctly implemented. The logic for checking if Alice or Bob can force a win or if it will be a draw is flawed.
- The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when the distance between the chips is small or when the chips are in specific positions that allow one player to force a win.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the game and the intricate conditions required to determine the winner, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic for all scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
