Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but interacts with a system to query the bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. It outputs a pair of indices (i, j) that maximize the bitwise XOR (âŠ•) of the elements at these indices in the permutation.**
