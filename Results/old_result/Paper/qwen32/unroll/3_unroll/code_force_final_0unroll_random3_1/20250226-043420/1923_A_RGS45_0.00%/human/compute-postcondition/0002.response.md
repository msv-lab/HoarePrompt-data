To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the code and understand what it does:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - `n` is read as the number of integers in the list.
   - `arr` is read as a string of `n` characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`. Since `y` is the index in the reversed string, the corresponding index in the original string is `n - 1 - y`.
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from `x` up to `n - y - 1` (inclusive). This is because `n - y` is the index of the last '1' in the original string, and we want to include this in the substring.
   - The code then counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` and prints this count.

The output for each test case is the count of '0's in the substring of `arr` that starts from the first '1' and ends at the last '1'.

Since the code executes for `t` test cases, the output state will be a series of counts of '0's for each test case.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the count of '0's in the substring of '1's for each test case.**
