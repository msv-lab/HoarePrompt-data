The code snippet defines a lambda function `q` that takes an integer `d` as input, prints a query in the format "? d", and then reads and returns a map object containing integers from the standard input. This map object is not further processed or converted to a list or any other data structure within the provided code snippet.

Since the function does not take any input arguments and the interaction is handled through standard input and output, the variable `n` (which represents the number of vertices in the graph) is not directly affected by this code snippet. However, the function `q` is now defined and can be used to perform queries as described.

Output State: **The function `func()` does not take any input arguments. The interaction is handled through standard input and output as described in the problem statement. For each test case, an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) is provided, representing the number of vertices in the graph. The function `q` is defined to take an integer `d`, print a query "? d", and return a map object of integers from the standard input.**
