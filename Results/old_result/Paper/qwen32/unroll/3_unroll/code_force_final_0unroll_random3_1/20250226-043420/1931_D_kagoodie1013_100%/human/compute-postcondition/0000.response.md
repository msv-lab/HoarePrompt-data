The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This means that the variable `results` is now an empty list, while all other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, etc.) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of integers a; `results` is an empty list.**
