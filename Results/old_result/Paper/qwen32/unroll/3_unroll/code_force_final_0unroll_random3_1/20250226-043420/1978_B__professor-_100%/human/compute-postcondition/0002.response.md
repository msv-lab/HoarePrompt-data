To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop reads `t` times from the input, where each input consists of three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each set of these integers, the loop performs a calculation based on the relationship between `a` and `b` and prints a result.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the loop's behavior based on the given conditions:

1. If `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`.
2. If `b - a >= n`, the output is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
3. Otherwise (if `b > a` and `b - a < n`), the output is `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are modified within the loop, but `t` is only used to control the number of iterations and is not modified within the loop body. After the loop finishes, `t` will still be the same value it was initially set to because it is not altered within the loop.

The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are redefined in each iteration of the loop, so after the loop finishes, they will hold the values from the last iteration. However, the main focus is on the outputs printed by the loop, not the final values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Since the loop prints a result for each iteration, and `t` iterations occur, the output state will be a series of `t` printed results based on the input values for each iteration.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The loop will print `t` lines, each representing the result of the calculation based on the input values `n`, `a`, and `b` for that iteration.**
