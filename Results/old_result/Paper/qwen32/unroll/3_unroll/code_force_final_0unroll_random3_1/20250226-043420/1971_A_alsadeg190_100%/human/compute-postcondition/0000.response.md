The code snippet `x = int(input())` will change the value of `x` to whatever integer is input by the user. The values of `t` and `y` remain unchanged. Since `x` is reassigned, its previous value is no longer relevant. The precondition for `t` remains the same, and the precondition for `y` also remains the same as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the integer input by the user, and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.**
