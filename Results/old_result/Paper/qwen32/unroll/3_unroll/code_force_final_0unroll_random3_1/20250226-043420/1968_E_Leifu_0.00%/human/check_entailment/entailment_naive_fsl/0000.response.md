Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells for all values of \(n\).

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **For \(n = 2\):**
   - The program outputs: `1 1`, `1 2`
   - This is correct as \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is optimal for \(n = 2\).

2. **For \(n = 3\):**
   - The program outputs: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 3`
   - This is correct as \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which is optimal for \(n = 3\).

3. **For \(n = 4\):**
   - The program outputs: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`
   - This is incorrect. The optimal arrangement for \(n = 4\) should maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. The provided points do not achieve this.

4. **For \(n = 5\):**
   - The program outputs: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `5 5`
   - This is incorrect. The optimal arrangement for \(n = 5\) should maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. The provided points do not achieve this.

5. **For \(n = 6\):**
   - The program outputs: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, `4 4`, `5 5`, `6 6`
   - This is incorrect. The optimal arrangement for \(n = 6\) should maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. The provided points do not achieve this.

The program has a fixed pattern for \(n > 3\) which does not maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. For \(n > 3\), the program outputs a pattern that does not explore all possible distinct Manhattan distances.

To summarize, the program does not correctly handle the cases for \(n > 3\) and does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) in these cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
