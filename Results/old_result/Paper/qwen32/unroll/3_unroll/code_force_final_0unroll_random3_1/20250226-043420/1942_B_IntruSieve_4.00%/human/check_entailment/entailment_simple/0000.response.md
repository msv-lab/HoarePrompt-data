### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute the `p_i` values. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The program attempts to track `minn` (the smallest unused non-negative integer) and `maxx` (the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered).
   - However, the logic for calculating `mex` (which should be the `p_i` values) is flawed. The `mex` list is supposed to be the permutation `p` that satisfies the given `a` array, but the current implementation does not correctly compute these values.

2. **Handling Positive and Negative Values**:
   - When `arr[i]` is positive, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This part seems correct as it tries to assign the smallest unused non-negative integer to `p_i`.
   - However, when `arr[i]` is negative, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is incorrect because `p_i` should be such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The correct value for `p_i` should be derived based on the MEX of the current permutation, not simply `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

3. **Updating `minn` and `maxx`**:
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is also flawed. `minn` should always point to the smallest unused non-negative integer, and `maxx` should track the maximum value of `p_i` encountered so far, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is not correctly constructing the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one needs to maintain a set of unused non-negative integers and compute `p_i` based on the MEX of the current permutation. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    unused = set(range(n))
    p = []
    
    for a_i in arr:
        mex = min(unused)
        p_i = mex - a_i
        p.append(p_i)
        unused.remove(mex)
    
    print(*p)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version maintains a set of unused non-negative integers and computes `p_i` based on the MEX of the current permutation, ensuring that the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the given array `a`.
