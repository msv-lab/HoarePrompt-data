Output State: **`N` is the integer input representing the length of the array `a`; `q` and the query boundaries `l` and `r` remain unchanged; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional `-1` appended at the end; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change is that the list `nums` now has an additional element `-1` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
