The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it prints '2' if there exists an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, otherwise it prints '3'. The function does not modify the input values `n` or `p` and outputs a series of '2's and '3's corresponding to each test case.
