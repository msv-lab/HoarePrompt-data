You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are equal.

### Key Observations

1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: If an array is beautiful, it means that any element `a[i]` can be replaced by `a[i-1]` or `a[i+1]` if they are equal, and this operation can be repeated until all elements are the same.

2. **Stopping Condition**: To stop the array from being beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no way to make all elements the same by the given operation. This implies that we need to break the pattern of equal adjacent elements.

3. **Minimum Removal**: The minimum number of elements to remove corresponds to the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements in the array. Removing all but one element from this segment will prevent the array from being beautiful.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove by identifying the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements. Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same`: Keeps track of the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - `num`: Stores the current number being counted.
   - `minn`: Stores the minimum length of any segment of identical elements found so far, initialized to infinity.

2. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one.
   - If the current element is the same as the previous one, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update to `minn` to account for the last segment.

3. **Output**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there was only one segment (the entire array was the same), and it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern.

### Correctness

The solution correctly identifies the smallest segment of identical elements and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern. However, there is a subtle issue: the condition `if minn == inf` is incorrect. This condition will only be true if the array is empty, which is not a valid input scenario. Instead, the condition should check if the array consists of a single element or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array, indicating that the entire array is the same.

### Corrected Condition

The correct condition should be:
- If `minn` is equal to `n` (the length of the array), it means the entire array is the same, and it should print `-1`.

### Conclusion

Given the provided solution, it does not handle the case where the entire array is the same correctly. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
