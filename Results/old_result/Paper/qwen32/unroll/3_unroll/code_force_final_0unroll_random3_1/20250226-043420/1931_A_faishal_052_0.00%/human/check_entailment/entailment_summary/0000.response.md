### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters for a given encoded integer `n`.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value of a 3-letter word.

2. **Constructing the Letters:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - It then enters a loop that iterates twice, where it tries to assign the maximum possible value (26) to the first two positions of the word, unless `lex` is less than or equal to 26.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it assigns 1 to the position and reduces `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 52, it assigns 26 to the position and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is greater than 52, it also assigns 26 to the position and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, `lex` is assigned to the third position in `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted, ensuring that the smallest possible values are assigned to the first positions, which is crucial for obtaining the lexicographically smallest word.
   - Finally, the program converts the values in `arr` to their corresponding letters by adding 96 (since `chr(97)` is 'a') and prints them.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of the values in `arr` equals `lex`.
   - By sorting `arr`, it guarantees that the smallest possible letters are assigned to the earliest positions, which is the requirement for the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The handling of `lex` values ensures that all possible sums between 3 and 78 are correctly mapped to valid 3-letter words.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for a given encoded integer `lex`. The sorting step is particularly important as it ensures the smallest possible word is chosen.

**Correctness: True**
