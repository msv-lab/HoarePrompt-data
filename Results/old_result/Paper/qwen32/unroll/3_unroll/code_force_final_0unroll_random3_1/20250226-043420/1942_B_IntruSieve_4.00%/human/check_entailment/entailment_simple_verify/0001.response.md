### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap
We need to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \) where each element \( a_i \) is defined as:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

#### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array \( a \) and constructing the permutation \( p \) based on the given formula.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the current minimum non-negative integer not yet used in \( p \).
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, representing the maximum value encountered in the `mex` list so far.

2. **Iteration through \( a \):**
   - For each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i \) is positive:
       - The program appends `minn` to `mex`.
       - Increments `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` by 1 again.
     - If \( a_i \) is non-positive:
       - The program appends \( |\text{arr}[i] - \text{minn}| \) to `mex`.
       - If \( |\text{arr}[i] - \text{minn}| \) is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `mex` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Non-Positive \( a_i \):** The program incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` when \( a_i \) is non-positive. It should be solving for \( p_i \) such that:
  \[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
  This implies:
  \[ p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \]
  The current implementation does not correctly handle this relationship.
  
- **Updating `maxx`:** The variable `maxx` is not being used correctly. It should track the maximum value in `mex`, but the current logic does not ensure this.

### Detailed Analysis with Annotations

Let's look at the annotated version of the code and the annotations provided:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: `mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is the final value after all increments, and `maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered during the loop.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: mex is a list of n integers, minn is the final value after all increments, and maxx is the maximum value of abs(arr[i] - minn) encountered during the loop.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
```

Annotations:
- Before the function call, the program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
- In `func_1`, `n` and `arr` are read.
- `mex` is initialized as an empty list.
- `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0.
- The loop iterates through each element in `arr`.
  - If `arr[i]` is positive, `minn` is appended to `mex`, and `minn` is incremented.
  - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is appended to `mex`, and `maxx` is updated if necessary.
- Finally, the constructed `mex` list is printed.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Positive \( a_i \):** The logic for positive \( a_i \) seems correct. It appends the current `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
- **Non-Positive \( a_i \):** The logic for non-positive \( a_i \) is incorrect. The program should calculate \( p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \). Instead, it appends \( |\text{arr}[i] - \text{minn}| \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \). The handling of non-positive values in \( a \) and the logic to maintain the MEX value are incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
