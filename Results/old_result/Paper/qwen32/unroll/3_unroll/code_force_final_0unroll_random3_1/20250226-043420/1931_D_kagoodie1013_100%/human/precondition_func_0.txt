test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of integers a. Specifically, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The total number of elements in all lists a across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
