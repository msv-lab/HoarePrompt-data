Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks visible from each installation independently and adding a constant value. Specifically, it calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation (`m // a`) and the second installation (`m // b`), and then adds 2 to this sum. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap in visibility times between fireworks launched from the two installations. The constant value of 2 added does not correctly represent the overlap or the maximum simultaneous visibility of fireworks.

To solve the problem correctly, one needs to consider the combined visibility intervals of fireworks from both installations. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when fireworks from both installations might overlap in visibility and then calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

Given the incorrect logic in the provided program, the execution summary does not reflect the correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
