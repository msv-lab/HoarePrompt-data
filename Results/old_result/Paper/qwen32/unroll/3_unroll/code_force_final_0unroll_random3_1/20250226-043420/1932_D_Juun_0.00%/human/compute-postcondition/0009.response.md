Output State: **trumps is an empty list, answers is a list of sorted pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit and appended strings of unpaired non-trump cards with trump cards, suits is a dictionary with suits having either None or the rank of an unpaired non-trump card.**

Explanation: Since `trumps` is initially an empty list, sorting it does not change its state. Therefore, `trumps` remains an empty list. The other variables (`answers` and `suits`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
