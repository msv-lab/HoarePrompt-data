The loop in the given code iterates over the range of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to `t-1`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t`.

Given that the state before the loop starts includes `t` as an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `t` to ensure that the loop executes at least once. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`) are defined within each iteration of the loop and do not affect whether the loop starts executing.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute, provided that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
