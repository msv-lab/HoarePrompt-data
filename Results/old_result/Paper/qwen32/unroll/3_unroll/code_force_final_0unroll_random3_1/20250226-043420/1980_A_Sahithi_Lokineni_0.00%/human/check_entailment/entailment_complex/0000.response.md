Reasoning:  
The provided annotated program does not correctly solve the problem described. The function `func_1` is mentioned but is not part of the main logic of the program. The main logic is supposed to calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case, but there are issues with the current implementation.

The main issues are:
1. The `default_value` function is not defined, which would cause a `NameError` when trying to initialize the `defaultdict`.
2. The logic for calculating the number of additional problems is incorrect. The current implementation adds `m - d[val]` to `ans` for every difficulty level `val` that has `d[val] <= m`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that each round needs one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. The current logic would overcount the number of additional problems needed.
3. The program should calculate the number of each difficulty level needed (`m` for each of 'A' to 'G') and compare it with the number of problems available in the bank. The difference for each level should be summed to get the total number of additional problems needed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of additional problems needed.

Correctness: **False**
