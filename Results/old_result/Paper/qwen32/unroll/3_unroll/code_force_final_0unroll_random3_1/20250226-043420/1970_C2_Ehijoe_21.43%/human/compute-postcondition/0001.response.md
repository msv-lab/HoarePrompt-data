Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of the node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer read from the input, and `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list.**

The `edges` list has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables remain unchanged.
