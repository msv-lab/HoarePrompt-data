t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second element is a list of n integers a_i where each a_i is either 0 or 1. Additionally, in each test case, there is at least one a_i that equals 1.
