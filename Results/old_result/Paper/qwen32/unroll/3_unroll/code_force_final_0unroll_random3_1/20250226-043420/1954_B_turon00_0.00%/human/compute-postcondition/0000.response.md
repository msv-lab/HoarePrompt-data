Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be the integer input by the user, while the conditions and constraints for `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are part of the problem's definition and not directly affected by the execution of the given code snippet.
