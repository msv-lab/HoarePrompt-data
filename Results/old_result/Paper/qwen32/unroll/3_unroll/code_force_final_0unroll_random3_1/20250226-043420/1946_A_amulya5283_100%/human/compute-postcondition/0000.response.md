`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**
