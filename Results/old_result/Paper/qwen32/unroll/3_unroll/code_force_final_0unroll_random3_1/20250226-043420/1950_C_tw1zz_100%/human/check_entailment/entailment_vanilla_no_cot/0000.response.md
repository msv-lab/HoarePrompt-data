Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It handles all the edge cases such as midnight ('00:00' -> '12:00 AM') and noon ('12:00' -> '12:00 PM'). The program iterates through each test case, splits the input string into hours and minutes, and then uses a series of if-elif statements to map the 24-hour time to the corresponding 12-hour time with the correct AM/PM suffix. The output format matches the problem's requirements, and the leading zeroes in the minutes are preserved.
