You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. This is followed by a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The number of test cases, t, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:

- Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- Vlad has a bank of `n` problems, each with a specific difficulty level.
- Vlad wants to minimize the number of additional problems he needs to create.

### Key Points:

- There are 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G').
- For `m` rounds, Vlad needs `m` problems of each difficulty level.
- Vlad needs to find the minimum number of additional problems to create to meet the requirement for `m` rounds.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Problems by Difficulty:**
   - A `defaultdict` is used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the bank.
   - The loop `for i in range(n): d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1` increments the count for each difficulty level found in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes `ans` (the answer) to 0.
   - It iterates over the keys (difficulty levels) in the dictionary `d`.
   - For each difficulty level, it checks if the count `d[val]` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - If `d[val] <= m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. This logic seems incorrect because it would overcount the problems needed if `d[val]` is already greater than `m`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:

- The logic `if d[val] <= m: ans = ans + m - d[val]` is flawed. It should only add the difference `m - d[val]` if `d[val]` is less than `m`. If `d[val]` is already `m` or more, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.
- The function `func_1()` is defined but never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
