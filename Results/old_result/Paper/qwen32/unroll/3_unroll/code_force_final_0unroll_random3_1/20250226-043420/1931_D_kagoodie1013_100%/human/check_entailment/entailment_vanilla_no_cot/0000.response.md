To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it step-by-step based on the problem description.

The program is supposed to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The given program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the number of elements that have specific remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\). The key for the dictionary is a tuple of the form \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\). For each element in the array, the program calculates the required remainders and checks if there are any previously seen elements that would form a beautiful pair with the current element.

Let's break down the logic:
1. For each element `num` in the array, it calculates `r_x` and `r_y` which are the remainders needed to form a beautiful pair with `num`. Specifically:
   - `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`, which is equivalent to the remainder that, when added to `num % x`, results in a multiple of `x`.
   - `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`, which is the remainder that, when subtracted from `num % y`, results in a multiple of `y`.

2. The program then checks if there are any elements in the `residue_map` that have the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If there are, it means there are elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element, and the count is incremented by the number of such elements.

3. The program then updates the `residue_map` with the current element's remainders.

The logic seems correct based on the problem description. The program efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of remainders and using a dictionary to keep track of the counts of specific remainders.

Thus, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
