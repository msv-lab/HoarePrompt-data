The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four integers: `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`. It also accepts two lists: `p` of length `n` and `a` of length `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case based on the given constraints. Specifically:

- If `t` is the number of test cases, for each test case:
  - `n` is the length of the lists `p` and `a`.
  - `k` is an integer.
  - `P_B` and `P_S` are integers representing some positions or identifiers.
  - `p` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and `n`.
  - `a` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^9\).

The function returns a value (which is not specified in detail here) for each of the `t` test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and for each of the `t` test cases, it accepts integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, a list `p` of `n` integers, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a value for each test case based on these inputs.**
