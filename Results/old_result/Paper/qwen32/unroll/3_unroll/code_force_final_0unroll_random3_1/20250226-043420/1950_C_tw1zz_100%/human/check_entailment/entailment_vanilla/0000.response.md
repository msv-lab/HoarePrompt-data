Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. However, there are several issues that make the program incorrect:

1. The program uses `map(str, input().split(':'))` to split the input time into hours and minutes. This is correct, but it then proceeds to handle each hour individually using a series of if-elif statements. This is inefficient and error-prone.

2. The program does not handle leading zeros correctly for the hours between 1 and 9 in the 12-hour format. For example, when converting 01:00, it should output "01:00 AM" but the logic provided will output "1:00 AM" (without the leading zero).

3. The logic for converting hours from 13 to 23 is correct, but the way it is implemented is repetitive and could be simplified using arithmetic operations.

4. The program does not correctly handle the conversion of 00:00 to 12:00 AM, which is a special case.

5. The program uses `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')` to format the output. This will add a space before the 'AM' or 'PM' which is not required according to the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not handle all cases properly and does not format the output correctly.

Correctness: **False**
