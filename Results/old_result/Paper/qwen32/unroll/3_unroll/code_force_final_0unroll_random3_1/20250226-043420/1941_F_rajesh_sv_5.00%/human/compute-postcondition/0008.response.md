The code assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. None of the other variables are modified by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the introduction of `ans`.

Output State: **`A` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second-largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair with the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`.**
