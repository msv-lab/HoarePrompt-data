Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - It initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - For each number in the array, it calculates `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It then checks how many times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before (using `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`) and adds this count to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current number's residues.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic used in the program is correct because:
- It correctly identifies pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic.
- It efficiently counts these pairs in a single pass through the array for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints.

The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program, and no edge cases were found where the program fails to produce the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
