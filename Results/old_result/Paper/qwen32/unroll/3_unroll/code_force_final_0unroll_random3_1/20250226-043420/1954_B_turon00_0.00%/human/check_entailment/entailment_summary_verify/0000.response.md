### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) (where \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\)).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program has the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because the array cannot stop being beautiful.
4. If not all elements are the same, it iterates through the array to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains all elements equal to the first element of the array.
5. It then prints the length of this shortest subarray.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary mentions that the program determines the length of the shortest contiguous subarray in the list `a` that contains all elements equal to the first element of the list. If all elements in the list are the same, it outputs `-1`.

#### Evaluation Against Problem Requirements:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here's why:

1. **Handling All Elements the Same:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by outputting `-1`.
   
2. **Finding Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - The program's logic of finding the shortest contiguous subarray that contains all elements equal to the first element is flawed.
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to disrupt the "beautiful" property, which involves more complex logic than just finding the shortest contiguous subarray of the first element.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
5
1 3 3 3 1
```
- The correct output should be `2` because we can remove the `3`s, resulting in the array `[1, 1]`, which is not beautiful.
- The program will output `1` because it finds the shortest sequence of consecutive elements, which is `1` (length 2), and incorrectly returns `1`.

Another test case:
```
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
- The correct output should be `2` because we can remove the `3` and one of the `2`s, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.
- The program will output `1` because it finds the shortest sequence of consecutive elements, which in this case is `2` or `1` (both of length 2), and will incorrectly return `1`.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly address the problem requirements. It fails to account for the necessary logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
