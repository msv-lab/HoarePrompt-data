You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Cost**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total cost when Kirill swaps positions. It should only add the cost of swapping and passing through people up to the point where Kirill reaches his desired position `m`. However, the current code adds costs in a way that may not lead to the minimum total cost.

2. **Logic for Updating Best Cost**:
   - The variable `best` is intended to keep track of the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people. However, the logic for updating `best` is flawed. The code updates `best` by comparing `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` with `best`, but it does not consider the cost of passing through people correctly.

3. **Handling of Costs**:
   - The code incorrectly adds `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost even if Kirill has already passed the position `m`. This can lead to an overestimation of the total cost.

Here is a potential counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Kirill can swap with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then pay 4 to pass the person at position 1. This totals to 7, but he can also swap directly with the person at position 1 (cost 7) and then pay 3 to pass the person at position 2. This totals to 10, but the optimal solution is to swap with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then pay 4 to pass the person at position 1, resulting in a total cost of 7 + 7 = 14.

**Actual Output from the Provided Code:**
- The provided code may not correctly compute this and could result in an incorrect total cost.

Therefore, the code does not handle all cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
