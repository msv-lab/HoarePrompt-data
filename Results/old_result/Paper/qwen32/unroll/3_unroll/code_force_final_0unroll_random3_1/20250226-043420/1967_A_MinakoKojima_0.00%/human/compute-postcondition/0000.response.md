The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates over the range of the integer value obtained from `input()`, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that the integer value obtained from `input()` is greater than 0. This integer value corresponds to the number of test cases `t`.

Given the problem statement, we want to adjust the state such that the loop will execute at least once, which means `t` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value (number of test cases `t`) is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0**
