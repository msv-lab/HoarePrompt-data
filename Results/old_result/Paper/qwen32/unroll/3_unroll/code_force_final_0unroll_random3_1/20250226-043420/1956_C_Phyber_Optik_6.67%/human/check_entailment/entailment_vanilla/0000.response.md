Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The sum of the numbers in a permutation of 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - To maximize the sum of the matrix, we should aim to have the highest possible numbers in as many cells as possible.

2. **Operations:**
   - Type 1: Fill a row with a permutation.
   - Type 2: Fill a column with a permutation.

3. **Strategy:**
   - It's beneficial to fill as many rows as possible with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) because it contains the highest possible sum of \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - If there are still remaining cells to fill, we can use Type 2 operations to fill columns with the same permutation.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to construct the operations as follows:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - For each row, it calculates the sum contribution by checking if the row number \( i \) is less than \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - If true, it adds the sum of the permutation \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) to the total sum.
   - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to the total sum.

2. **Operation Construction:**
   - It prints \( n + r \) operations, where \( r \) is determined during the sum calculation.
   - For the first \( n \) operations, it fills rows with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - For the remaining \( r \) operations, it fills columns with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

### Issues in the Program

1. **Sum Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum is incorrect. The sum of a permutation is always \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and it should be added for each row filled.
   - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:` does not make sense in this context.

2. **Operation Counting:**
   - The variable \( r \) is not correctly calculated to determine the number of operations.
   - The program does not ensure that the total number of operations is at most \( 2n \).

3. **Output:**
   - The output format and logic for constructing operations are incorrect.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix or ensure that the number of operations is at most \( 2n \).

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
