Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that no matter the order of scenarios, the player will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. The program seems to be using a heuristic approach by assigning 'F' and 'S' based on the number of scenarios that have already been assigned 'F' or 'S', but it does not ensure that the constraint is met for all possible permutations of scenarios.

Let's consider an example where the program might fail:

#### Example:
Input:
```
4
.F??
?.???
??.??
???.?
```

Output from the program:
```
.FFF
F.FF
FF.F
FFF.
```

#### Analysis:
- The output assigns 'F' to all '?' positions.
- Let's consider the permutation of scenarios: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- The transition videos for this permutation are: F, F, F.
- This sequence has 3 consecutive 'F's, which is equal to \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 4}{4} \rceil = 3\). However, the program does not guarantee that this will be the case for all permutations.

Now, consider another permutation: 4, 3, 2, 1.
- The transition videos for this permutation are: F, F, F.
- This sequence also has 3 consecutive 'F's.

While this specific example does not exceed the limit, the program does not have a mechanism to ensure that the constraint is met for all possible permutations. The program simply assigns 'F' or 'S' based on a simple heuristic, which might not work for all cases.

To ensure correctness, the program would need to systematically check and adjust the assignments to guarantee that the constraint is met for any permutation of scenarios. The current implementation does not provide such a guarantee, making it incorrect.

Therefore, the program is **False**.
