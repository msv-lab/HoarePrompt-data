The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). After executing the code, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input, but it will still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
