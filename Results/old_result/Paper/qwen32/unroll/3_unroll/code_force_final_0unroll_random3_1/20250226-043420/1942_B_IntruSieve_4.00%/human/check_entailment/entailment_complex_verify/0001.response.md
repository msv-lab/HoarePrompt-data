### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \).

#### Problem Recap:
We need to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \) where each element \( a_i \) is defined as:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

This can be rearranged to solve for \( p_i \):
\[ p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \]

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array \( a \) and constructing the permutation \( p \) based on the given formula. Let's break down the key steps and identify any issues.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the current minimum non-negative integer not yet used in \( p \).

2. **Iteration through \( a \):**
   - For each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i \) is positive:
       - The program appends `minn` to `mex`.
       - Increments `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` by 1 again.
     - If \( a_i \) is non-positive:
       - The program appends \( |\text{arr}[i] - \text{minn}| \) to `mex`.
       - If \( |\text{arr}[i] - \text{minn}| \) is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `mex` for each test case.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Positive \( a_i \):**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` when \( a_i \) is non-positive. It should be solving for \( p_i \) such that:
     \[ p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \]
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle this relationship.

2. **Updating `maxx`:**
   - The variable `maxx` is not being used correctly. It should track the maximum value in `mex`, but the current logic does not ensure this.

3. **Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The program does not correctly maintain the MEX value. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the current prefix of `mex`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and compute the MEX value dynamically. Here's a corrected version of the approach:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `used` is a set to keep track of numbers already used in `mex`.

2. **Iteration through \( a \):**
   - For each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \):
     - Compute the MEX value by finding the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
     - Compute \( p_i \) as \( \texttt{MEX} - a_i \).
     - Append \( p_i \) to `mex`.
     - Add \( p_i \) to the `used` set.

3. **Output:**
   - Print the constructed permutation `mex`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \). The handling of non-positive values in \( a \) and the logic to maintain the MEX value are incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
