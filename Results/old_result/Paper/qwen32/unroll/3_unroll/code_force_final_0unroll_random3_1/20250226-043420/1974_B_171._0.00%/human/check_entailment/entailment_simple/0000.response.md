Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. The decoding process requires identifying the unique characters in the encoded string, sorting them alphabetically, and then mapping each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in this sorted list. The current implementation of `func_1` does not follow this procedure.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Unique Character Identification and Sorting**: The code does not first identify the unique characters in the encoded string and sort them alphabetically. Instead, it tries to map each character in the encoded string to the next available character in the alphabet that hasn't been used yet. This approach does not align with the encoding process described.

2. **Symmetric Mapping**: The code does not create a symmetric mapping based on the sorted list of unique characters. Instead, it maps each character to the next available character in the alphabet without considering the symmetric property.

3. **Mapping Logic**: The current mapping logic is flawed. It assigns a new character from the alphabet to each unique character in the encoded string without considering the symmetric property required by the problem.

To correct the implementation, the following steps should be followed:

- Identify the unique characters in the encoded string.
- Sort these unique characters alphabetically.
- Create a symmetric mapping from these sorted characters.
- Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Correctness: **False**
