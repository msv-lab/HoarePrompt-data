Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum score. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Logic for `if k >= n * m`**: The program correctly identifies that if we can buy enough cards to make all counts equal to `m + 1`, then the maximum score is `n!` (n factorial). However, this part is fine.

2. **Logic for `else` block**: 
    - The program tries to distribute the remaining `k` cards among the `n` types of cards. However, the way it does this is incorrect. It calculates a new count for each type of card and then tries to compute the score based on the differences between consecutive counts. This is not the correct approach to maximize the number of valid permutations of length `n`.

The correct approach should be to:
- Calculate the minimum count `m` of any card type.
- Determine how many cards need to be bought so that all card counts are at least `m + 1`.
- If `k` is sufficient to achieve this, then the score is `n!`.
- If not, distribute the remaining `k` cards in a way that maximizes the counts of the card types that are closest to `m + 1`.

The current implementation incorrectly calculates the score by multiplying differences between consecutive card counts, which does not align with the problem's requirement of counting permutations of length `n`.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
