You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads the number of sticks and their lengths for a single test case, counts how many sets of four sticks of the same length can be formed, and prints the total number of such sets.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be used in more than one polygon. Regular polygons have all sides of equal length, and the smallest regular polygon is a triangle (3 sides), but the problem does not specify a minimum number of sides, so we can assume the smallest polygon is a triangle.

However, the program seems to assume that the smallest polygon is a square (4 sides) because it divides the count of each stick length by 4 to determine how many squares can be formed.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0.
   - For each unique stick length, it calculates how many squares can be formed from the sticks of that length by integer division of the count by 4 (`x // 4`).
   - It adds this number to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the total number of squares that can be formed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Polygon Assumption:** The program assumes that the smallest polygon is a square (4 sides), which is not necessarily true based on the problem statement. The problem does not specify a minimum number of sides, so it could be interpreted as finding the maximum number of polygons of any size (3 or more sides).
- **Generalization:** The program should be generalized to find the maximum number of polygons of any size, not just squares. For instance, it should check for the possibility of forming triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it only considers squares (polygons with 4 sides) and does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with fewer sides (3 or more).

### Correctness:
**Correctness: False**
