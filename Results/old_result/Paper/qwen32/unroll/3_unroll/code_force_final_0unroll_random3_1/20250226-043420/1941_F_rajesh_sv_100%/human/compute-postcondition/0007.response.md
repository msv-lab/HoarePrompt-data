The code assigns the value of `A[index - 1]` to `left` and the value of `A[index]` to `right`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`.**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged. The variable `left` is assigned the value of the element at the position `index - 1` in the list `A`, and the variable `right` is assigned the value of the element at the position `index` in the list `A`.
