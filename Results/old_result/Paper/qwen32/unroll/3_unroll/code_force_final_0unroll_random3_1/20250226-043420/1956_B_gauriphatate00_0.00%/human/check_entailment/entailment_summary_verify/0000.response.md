### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided code to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- You and Nene play a card game with 2n cards, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- Each player starts with n cards.
- Players take turns placing cards on the table. You score a point if a card with the same number is already on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Code Analysis:
- **`func_1(n, a)`**: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get.
  - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
  - It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
  - It returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.

- **`func_2()`**: This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary for `func_2` is incorrect. It states that the function computes the number of unique integers that appear exactly once in the list, which is not the case. Instead, it computes the maximum number of points you can get based on the pairs of numbers in your hand.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `4\n1 1 2 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: You can get at most 1 point by placing the second `1` when there's already a `1` on the table.
   - `func_1(4, [1, 1, 2, 3])` calculates `pairs = 1` (only one pair of `1`s) and returns `min(1, 2) = 1`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `8\n7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: You can get at most 2 points by placing the second `8` and the second `5` when there are already cards of the same number on the table.
   - `func_1(8, [7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5])` calculates `pairs = 2` (pairs of `8`s and `5`s) and returns `min(2, 4) = 2`.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `8\n7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: You can get at most 1 point by placing the second `4` when there's already a `4` on the table.
   - `func_1(8, [7, 1, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6])` calculates `pairs = 1` (only one pair of `4`s) and returns `min(1, 4) = 1`.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `3\n1 2 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: You cannot get any points since each number appears only once in your hand.
   - `func_1(3, [1, 2, 3])` calculates `pairs = 0` (no pairs) and returns `min(0, 1) = 0`.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `1\n1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: You cannot get any points since there's only one card and no pair.
   - `func_1(1, [1])` calculates `pairs = 0` (no pairs) and returns `min(0, 0) = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by considering the pairs of numbers in your hand and the optimal play by Nene. It handles all the provided examples correctly and adheres to the constraints given in the problem description.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
