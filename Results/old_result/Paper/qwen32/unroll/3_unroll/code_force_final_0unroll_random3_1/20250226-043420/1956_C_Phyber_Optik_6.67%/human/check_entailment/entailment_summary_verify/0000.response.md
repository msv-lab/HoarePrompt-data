Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment in detail.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using two types of operations:
1. **Type 1 Operation**: Assign a permutation to a row.
2. **Type 2 Operation**: Assign a permutation to a column.

The maximum sum can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\). This results in each row and each column summing to \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). Therefore, the total sum of the matrix is:
\[ \text{Total Sum} = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \]

### Program Analysis
The provided program calculates the sum and operations as follows:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum based on a conditional logic involving `r` and `i`.
   - The logic does not correctly compute \(\frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\).
2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints operations based on `n + r`, which does not ensure that each row and column is filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior:
- It processes multiple test cases.
- It calculates a sum based on a conditional logic.
- It prints a sequence of operations involving indices and ranges up to `n + r`.

### Original Assessment Analysis
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program's logic for sum calculation is incorrect.
   - The correct sum should be \(\frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\).
2. **Operations**:
   - The operations do not ensure that each row and column is filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
   - The operations are not correctly formatted.

### Corrected Program
The corrected program should:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Calculate the sum as \(\frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\).
2. **Operations**:
   - Perform `n` type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
   - Perform `n` type 2 operations to fill each column with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum and the required operations. The corrected version of the program ensures that the maximum sum is achieved and the operations are correctly formatted.

**Final: False**
