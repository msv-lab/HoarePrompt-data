Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which attempts to map characters from the encoded string to the original string. However, it does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The program tries to map each character in the encoded string to a character from 'a' to 'z' in order, skipping characters that are already used as values in the mapping. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the symmetric relationship between characters in the auxiliary string `r`.

2. The mapping should be based on the symmetric relationship defined in the problem statement: the first character of `r` maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.

3. The program does not construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string, which is necessary to determine the correct symmetric mapping.

To fix the program, you need to follow these steps:

1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` by finding all distinct characters in the encoded string and sorting them alphabetically.

2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.

3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

def decode(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
    r = sorted(set(encoded))
    # Step 2: Create the symmetric mapping
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    # Step 3: Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = decode(encoded)
        print(decoded)
```

This corrected program constructs the auxiliary string `r`, creates the symmetric mapping, and then decodes the encoded string correctly.
