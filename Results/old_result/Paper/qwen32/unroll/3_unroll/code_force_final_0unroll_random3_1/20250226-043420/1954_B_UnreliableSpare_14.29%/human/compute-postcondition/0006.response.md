The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `val` and initializes `cnt` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'); `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 0.**
