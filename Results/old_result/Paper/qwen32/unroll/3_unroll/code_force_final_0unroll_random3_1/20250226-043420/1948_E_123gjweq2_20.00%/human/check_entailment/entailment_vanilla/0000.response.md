Let's analyze the provided Python program to see if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Assign each vertex \(i\) an integer \(a_i\) such that all \(a_i\) are distinct integers from 1 to \(n\).
   - Add an edge between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq k\).

2. **Partitioning**:
   - Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two lists `arr` and `cliquess` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to populate `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - It prints the values in `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values in `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - It assigns values to the `arr` list from `left` to `right` indices.
   - It assigns the same `clique` number to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`.
   - The assignment logic is not entirely clear, but it seems to be trying to distribute the values in a specific way.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The variables `arr` and `cliquess` are used in `make_array` but are not passed as arguments or returned from `func_1`. This is a bad practice and can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in a multi-test case scenario.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**:
   - The logic in `make_array` for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The program does not ensure that the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq k\) is met for all pairs within the same clique.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the output format is correct for all test cases, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques with the given constraints. The logic for assigning values and forming cliques is flawed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
