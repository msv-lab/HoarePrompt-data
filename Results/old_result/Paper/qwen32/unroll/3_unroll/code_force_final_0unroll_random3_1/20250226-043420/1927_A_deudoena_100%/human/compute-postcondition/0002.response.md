The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`. After executing the code, the value of `s` will be updated to the new input string, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ma`, `mi`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10; `s` is a new input string consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is an input integer.**
