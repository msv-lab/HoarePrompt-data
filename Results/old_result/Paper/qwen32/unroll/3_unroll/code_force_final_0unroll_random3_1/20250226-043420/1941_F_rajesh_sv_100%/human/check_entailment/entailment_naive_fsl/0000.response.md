Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are some specific problems:

1. **Incorrect Memoization Implementation:**
   - The `func_1` and `wrapper` functions are supposed to implement memoization, but they are not used correctly in the code. The `wrapper` function is not even defined properly since `d` is a local variable inside `func_1` and cannot be accessed in `wrapper`. This part of the code is not only unused but also incorrectly implemented.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle some edge cases properly. For example, when the new problem complexity `d_i + f_j` is less than the smallest element in `A` or greater than the largest element in `A`, the code does not correctly update the imbalance. Specifically, the code does not consider the possibility of adding a new problem that could reduce the imbalance by changing the smallest or largest gap in `A`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Imbalance:**
   - The code calculates the potential new imbalance by considering only the gaps between `left` and `right` and does not consider the potential new gaps that could be created by inserting the new problem at the beginning or end of the list `A`. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the optimal solution involves adding a problem with a complexity less than `A[0]` or greater than `A[n-1]`.

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2 2
1 10 20
1 15
1 1
```
- The current imbalance is `20 - 1 = 19` and `10 - 1 = 9`, so the maximum imbalance is `19`.
- By adding a problem with complexity `1 + 1 = 2`, the new list becomes `[1, 2, 10, 20]` and the new imbalances are `2 - 1 = 1`, `10 - 2 = 8`, and `20 - 10 = 10`. The maximum imbalance is now `10`.
- By adding a problem with complexity `15 + 1 = 16`, the new list becomes `[1, 10, 16, 20]` and the new imbalances are `10 - 1 = 9`, `16 - 10 = 6`, and `20 - 16 = 4`. The maximum imbalance is now `9`.
- The correct answer should be `4`, but the code might not correctly handle this case.

Given these issues, the code is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
