The given code snippet calls a function `make_stairs(i - 1)`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `i`, `start_index`, `is_already_stairs`, or the array `arr` in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged after the function call. 

The only change is that the function `make_stairs` is executed with the argument `i - 1`. However, since the function's definition and its effects are not provided, we can only assume that it performs some operations that do not affect the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, indicating that not all elements in the subarray from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` satisfy `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. The current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**
