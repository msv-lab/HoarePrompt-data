To determine the output state after the loop completes its execution, let's analyze the given loop and the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers with an additional `-1` appended to it.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `e` is initialized to 0.
   - `num` is initialized to `nums[0]`.
   - `arr` is initialized to an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = N` (inclusive).
   - For each iteration, it checks if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.
     - If they are not equal, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`.
     - It then updates `s` to the current index `i`.
   - Regardless of the condition, it updates `num` to `nums[i]`.

### What the Loop Does:

- The loop essentially identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in the list `nums`.
- For each segment, it records the start index (1-based), the end index (0-based), and the number that forms the segment.
- The loop appends these segments to the list `arr`.

### Final State:

- After the loop completes, `arr` will contain tuples representing all segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
- The variables `s`, `e`, `num`, and `i` will have their final values based on the last iteration of the loop.

### Final Values:

- `s` will be the index of the last change in the sequence (or `N` if no change occurred at the last element).
- `e` remains unchanged as 0 (since it is not modified in the loop).
- `num` will be the last number in `nums` (which is `-1` due to the appended `-1`).
- `i` will be `N` after the loop completes.

### Output State:

The output state after the loop executes all iterations will be:

Output State: **`arr` contains tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`, `s` is the index of the last change in the sequence, `e` is 0, `num` is -1, and `i` is `N`.**
