Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding

1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we have an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`.
   
2. **Process:**
   - Perform the following operation `n` times:
     1. Select an index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ |a|).
     2. Insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S` (note that `S` only contains unique elements).
     3. Remove `a[i]` from `a`, shifting the indices of elements to the right of `a[i]` by 1.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
   
3. **Output:**
   - Construct a new array `b` which is the sorted version of `S` in decreasing order.
   - Find the lexicographically largest `b` possible.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

#### Key Steps in the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`.
   - It creates a `Counter` object to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in decreasing order.
   - It calculates the number of elements that were removed due to being duplicates (`cnt`).
   - It constructs the array `ans` by iterating through the sorted unique elements of `a`:
     - If the current element is not the first one, it appends additional elements to `ans` to account for the duplicates and to maximize the lexicographical order.
     - It appends the current element to `ans` and updates the `Counter` and `cur` (current count of duplicates).
   - After the loop, if there are still elements to be added (`cnt` > 0), it appends the last element of `ans` minus 1 for each remaining count.
   - Finally, it prints the array `ans`.

#### Correctness Check

1. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program correctly modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program correctly uses a `Counter` to handle duplicates and ensures that the final array `b` is constructed by considering the unique elements in decreasing order.

3. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique elements and appends additional elements to maximize the lexicographical order by considering the duplicates.
   - It handles the remaining duplicates after the loop by appending the last element of `ans` minus 1 for each remaining count.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case, which should be the lexicographically largest `b` possible.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the steps required to solve the problem. It handles the modification of the array, manages duplicates, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
