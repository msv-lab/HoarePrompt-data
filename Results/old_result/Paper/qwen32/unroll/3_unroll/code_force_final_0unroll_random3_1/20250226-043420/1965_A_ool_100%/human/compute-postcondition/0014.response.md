Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers where the first element represents the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function determines the winner of a game based on the uniqueness and consecutive nature of the stone counts. It returns 'Alice' if the number of unique stone counts minus one is even, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.**
