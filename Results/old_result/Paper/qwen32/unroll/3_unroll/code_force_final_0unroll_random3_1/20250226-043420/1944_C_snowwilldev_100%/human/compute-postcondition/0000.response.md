The code snippet provided reads an integer `N` from the input, which represents the size of an array `a` that will be provided in the next line. Since the array `a` is not yet read, its state remains unchanged. The only change is the assignment of the value of `N` from the input.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input.**
