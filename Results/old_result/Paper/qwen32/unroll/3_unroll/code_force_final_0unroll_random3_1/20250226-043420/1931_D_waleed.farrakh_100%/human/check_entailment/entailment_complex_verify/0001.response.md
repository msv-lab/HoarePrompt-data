### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Conditions for Beautiful Pairs:
1. \( a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x} \) which implies \( a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x} \).
2. \( a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y} \) which implies \( a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y} \).

#### Analysis of `func_1(test_cases)`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `freq` is a dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).
   - `count` is initialized to 0 to count the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through each element `a` in `arr`:**
   - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` calculates the equivalent non-negative remainder of \(-a \pmod{x}\).
   - `ry = a % y` calculates the remainder of `a` when divided by `y`.
   - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, it means there are elements previously seen that satisfy the conditions for a beautiful pair with the current element. The count is incremented by the frequency of `(rx, ry)`.
   - The frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is updated in the `freq` dictionary.

3. **Appending the result:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case is appended to the `results` list.

#### Analysis of `func_2()`:

- This function handles input parsing and calls `func_1` to process each test case.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
- It appends each test case to the `test_cases` list and calls `func_1` to get the results.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

#### Annotated Code:

- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations, indicating that the program correctly processes each test case and counts the number of beautiful pairs.

### Validation:

- The program correctly computes the equivalent non-negative remainder of \(-a \pmod{x}\) using `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`.
- It checks for the presence of the pair `(rx, ry)` in the `freq` dictionary to count beautiful pairs.
- The frequency dictionary is updated correctly to keep track of the pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The annotations confirm that the program's behavior aligns with the intended logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
