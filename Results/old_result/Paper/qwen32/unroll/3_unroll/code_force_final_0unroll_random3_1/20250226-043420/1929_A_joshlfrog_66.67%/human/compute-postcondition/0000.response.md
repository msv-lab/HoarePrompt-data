The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input read from the user, and the conditions on `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input read from the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
