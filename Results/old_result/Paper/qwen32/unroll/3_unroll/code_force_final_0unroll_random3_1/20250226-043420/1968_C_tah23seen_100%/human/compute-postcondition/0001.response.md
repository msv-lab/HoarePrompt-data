The variable `i` is assigned the value `n - 2`. Given that `n` is `len(arr) + 1`, the value of `i` becomes `len(arr) - 1`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 499 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr); `n` is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is `10`; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
