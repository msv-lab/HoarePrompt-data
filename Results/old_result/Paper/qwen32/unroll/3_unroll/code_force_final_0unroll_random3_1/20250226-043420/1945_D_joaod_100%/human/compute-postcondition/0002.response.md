To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does with the given inputs and how the variables change throughout the process. The loop runs for `cases` iterations, and in each iteration, it processes two lists of costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`) along with two positions (`na_frente` and `pos_final`). 

The loop calculates the minimum cost to reach `pos_final` from `na_frente` by either passing or swapping at each position. The variable `best` keeps track of the minimum cost found, and `total` accumulates the cost as it iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0.

After each iteration, the loop prints the `best` cost for that particular case.

Since the loop runs `cases` times, and each iteration processes a new set of inputs and updates `best` and `total` for that specific case, the final output state will be the printed `best` values for each of the `cases` iterations.

Given that the state of `t` (which is not used in the loop) and `cases` remain unchanged, and the loop does not affect any other variables outside of its scope, the output state will simply be the series of printed `best` values for each case.

Output State: **the series of printed `best` values for each of the `cases` iterations.**
