You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

    #State: a series of three lowercase letters for each test case, based on the value of `lex` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `lex` between 1 and 78. For each test case, it outputs a sequence of three lowercase letters derived from the value of `lex`. The letters are determined by converting parts of `lex` into their corresponding positions in the alphabet.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded sum. Let's analyze the program and find a case where it fails.

The program constructs the word by first determining the values of the first two letters and then setting the third letter to the remaining value. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If the encoded sum (`lex`) is less than or equal to 26, it assigns 1 to the first two letters and the remaining value to the third letter.
2. If the encoded sum is less than 52 but greater than 26, it assigns 26 to the first letter, 1 to the second letter, and the remaining value to the third letter.
3. If the encoded sum is 52 or greater, it assigns 26 to the first two letters and the remaining value to the third letter.

After determining the values, it sorts the list of values and converts them to characters.

Let's consider a test case where the encoded sum is 28. The correct lexicographically smallest word should be "aab" (1 + 1 + 26). However, the program will produce "abc" (1 + 2 + 25) because it always assigns 26 to the first letter if the sum is 52 or greater after considering the first two letters.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown for the test case with `lex = 28`:

1. The program assigns 26 to the first letter, 1 to the second letter, and the remaining value (28 - 27 = 1) to the third letter.
2. The list `[26, 1, 1]` is sorted to `[1, 1, 26]`.
3. The characters are `['a', 'a', 'z']`, resulting in the word "aaz".

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word. A correct approach should involve assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters while ensuring the sum of all three letters equals the encoded sum.
