Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not always produce a valid partition when one exists. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Palindromic Strings**: The program does not correctly identify all palindromic strings. For instance, it checks only the first and last character and assumes the string is not a palindrome if they are different. This is incorrect because a string can be a palindrome even if the first and last characters are different (e.g., "abccba").

2. **Handling of Uniform Strings**: The program correctly identifies uniform strings (strings where all characters are the same) as not having a valid partition. However, it does not handle cases where the majority of characters are the same but there are a few different characters scattered throughout the string.

3. **Partitioning Logic**: The partitioning logic is flawed. The program attempts to find a partition by checking the symmetry of the string and counting character occurrences, but it does not always produce a valid partition when one exists. For example, it does not correctly handle cases where the string can be partitioned into multiple non-palindromic substrings.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as strings of length 2 or 3 that are not palindromes but require a specific partitioning strategy.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be rewritten to correctly identify palindromic substrings and find a valid partition when one exists. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        if not is_palindrome(s):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(s)
            continue
        # Try to partition the string into two parts
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            left = s[:i]
            right = s[i:]
            if not is_palindrome(left) and not is_palindrome(right):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(left)
                print(right)
                break
        else:
            # If no valid partition found, try three parts
            for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(s)):
                    left = s[:i]
                    middle = s[i:j]
                    right = s[j:]
                    if not is_palindrome(left) and not is_palindrome(middle) and not is_palindrome(right):
                        print('YES')
                        print(3)
                        print(left)
                        print(middle)
                        print(right)
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks for palindromic substrings and attempts to partition the string into two or three parts to ensure each part is not a palindrome.
