You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing the transition video type between scenarios i and j, where '?' indicates an undecided video, 'F' indicates a funny video, 'S' indicates a scary video, and '.' indicates i=j. The input guarantees that the i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j, and that at most floor(n/2) transition videos are already decided.

Otherwise, `xx` is set to `['', 'SSFSS', 'SFFFF', 'SSFSS', 'FFFFF', 'FFFFF', 'FFFFF', 'FFFFF']`. `sa` is a list of indices where there are 'F's but no 'S's, plus any indices where both 'F' and 'S' counts are zero, and `sb` is a list of indices where there are 'S's but no 'F's.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and an `n x n` matrix of characters representing transition video types between scenarios, and returns a valid configuration of the matrix with all '?' characters replaced by 'F' or 'S' if possible, otherwise returns an error message.
