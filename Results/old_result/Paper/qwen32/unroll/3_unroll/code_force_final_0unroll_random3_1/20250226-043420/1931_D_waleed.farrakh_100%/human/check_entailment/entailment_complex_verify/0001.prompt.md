You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a`. A pair of indices `<i, j>` is considered beautiful if:
- `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
- `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

### Key Observations:
- For the condition `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, we need `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x) ≡ 0 (mod x)`.
- For the condition `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, we need `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y) ≡ 0 (mod y)` which simplifies to `(a_i % y) ≡ (a_j % y) (mod y)`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(test_cases)`: This function processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` to get results.

#### `func_1(test_cases)`:
- It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` pairs.
- For each element `a` in the array, it calculates `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
- It then checks if `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of `(rx, ry)` to the count of beautiful pairs.
- It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
- Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list.

#### `func_2()`:
- This function reads the input, parses the test cases, and calls `func_1` to compute the results.
- It prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly computes `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` to ensure that the modulo operation yields a non-negative result.
- It correctly checks the condition for beautiful pairs using the modulo properties mentioned above.
- The frequency dictionary `freq` is used efficiently to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
- The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the results correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
