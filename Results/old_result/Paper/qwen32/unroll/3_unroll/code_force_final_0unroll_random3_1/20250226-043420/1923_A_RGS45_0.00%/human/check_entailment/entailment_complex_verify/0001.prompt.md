You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. At least one a_i is 1 in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: a series of integers, each representing the count of '0's in the substring of '1's for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to move chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of operations. Each operation involves moving a chip to the nearest free cell to its left.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells, `n`, and the configuration of cells as a string of '0's and '1's, where '1' represents a chip and '0' represents a free cell.

2. **Finding the Range of Chips:**
   - The program finds the index of the first chip (`x`) using `arr.find('1')`.
   - It finds the index of the last chip from the right (`y`) by reversing the string and finding the first '1', then converting it back to the original index (`n - y - 1`).
   - The substring `z` is then taken from the first chip to the last chip.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of free cells ('0's) in the substring `z` and prints this count as the result.

### Flaw in the Program

The main flaw in the program is in the way it determines the range of chips and counts the free cells. The program only considers the free cells between the first and last chip but does not account for the fact that chips can be moved past the first chip to the leftmost free cell.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach would involve:
- Identifying the positions of all chips.
- Calculating the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a contiguous block.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the first test case from the example:

```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

- The first chip is at index 1.
- The last chip is at index 6.
- The substring `z` is `1 1 1 0 1 1`.
- The program counts 2 free cells ('0's) in `z` and outputs 2, which is incorrect.

The correct output should be 1, as moving the chip at index 6 to index 4 would result in a contiguous block of chips.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
