You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), where n is the number of moves Nikita can make and m is the desired number of cubes in the tower.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100), where `n` is the number of moves Nikita can make and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. For each test case, if the difference between `n` and `m` is non-negative and even, the current test case satisfies the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. Otherwise, either `n - m` is not divisible by 2 or `n - m` is less than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it determines if the difference between `n` and `m` is non-negative and even, printing "Yes" if true and "No" otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in a tower after `n` moves.
- **Moves**: Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- **Input**: 
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case: `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).
- **Output**: "Yes" if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, otherwise "No".

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It checks the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` and prints "Yes" if the condition is true, otherwise "No".

### Correctness Check
The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` can be analyzed as follows:
- **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, so an even difference means we can reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes by an even number of moves.
- **`n - m >= 0`**: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as many as the number of cubes we want to have. If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.

### Edge Cases
- **`n = m`**: This should return "Yes" because we can simply add one cube per move.
- **`n > m`**: This should return "Yes" if `n - m` is even, because we can add `m` cubes and then remove `(n - m)` cubes in pairs.
- **`n < m`**: This should return "No" because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.

### Verifying with Examples
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3` -> `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `3 - 3 >= 0` -> "Yes"
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4` -> `(2 - 4) % 2 != 0` -> "No"
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3` -> `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `5 - 3 >= 0` -> "Yes"

All the examples match the expected output.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all the cases based on the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs that the program fails to handle correctly.
