Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of parameters and lists, to determine the winner between Bodya and Sasha based on their maximum possible scores after a specified number of moves. For each test case, it outputs either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on the comparison of their scores. The input parameters and lists remain unchanged after processing each test case.**
