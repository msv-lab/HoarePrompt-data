Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Default Value Function**: The function `default_value` is referenced in the `defaultdict` initialization but is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Counting Additional Problems**: The logic in the program to count the additional problems needed is incorrect. The current logic adds `m - d[val]` to the answer for every difficulty level `val` that has `d[val] <= m`. However, this will overcount the problems that need to be created because it doesn't account for the fact that each round needs one problem of each difficulty level.

3. **Handling of Difficulty Levels**: The code does not explicitly check if all required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') are present and correctly counts the number of additional problems needed for each missing or underrepresented difficulty level.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
The program will likely produce an incorrect output due to the issues mentioned above.

**Correct Approach:**
For each test case, we need to count the occurrences of each difficulty level and then determine how many more problems are needed to ensure that each of the 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') has at least `m` problems.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def default_value():
    return 0

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for level in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[level] < m:
            ans += m - d[level]
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that we correctly count the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level, and it handles the default value properly.
