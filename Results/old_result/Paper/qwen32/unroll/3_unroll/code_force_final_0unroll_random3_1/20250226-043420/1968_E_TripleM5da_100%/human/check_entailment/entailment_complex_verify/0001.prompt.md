You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

        n = int(input())

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of the grid and the number of cells to choose.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)

        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: For each test case with input integer `n`, the output will be `1, 1`, `1, 2`, and then `i, i` for each `i` from `3` to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it outputs a series of coordinate pairs starting with `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, followed by `(i, i)` for each integer `i` from `3` to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem requirements step by step.

The problem requires us to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program provided outputs the following for each test case:

1. It starts by printing the cell \((1, 1)\).
2. It then prints the cell \((1, 2)\).
3. For each subsequent cell (from the 3rd cell to the \(n\)-th cell), it prints the cell \((i, i)\) where \(i\) ranges from 3 to \(n\).

Let's consider the Manhattan distances generated by this arrangement:
- The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) is 1.
- The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((i, i)\) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1)\).
- The distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((i, i)\) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-1)\) if \(i \geq 3\).
- The distance between \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) for \(i, j \geq 3\) and \(i \neq j\) is \(|i-j| + |i-j| = 2|i-j|\).

From this, we see that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will include the distances 0 (from a cell to itself), 1 (from \((1, 1)\) to \((1, 2)\)), and all even numbers from 2 up to \(2(n-1)\) (from \((1, 1)\) or \((1, 2)\) to \((i, i)\) for \(i \geq 3\)).

However, the optimal solution should aim to include as many distinct Manhattan distances as possible, including odd numbers and other combinations. The provided program does not achieve this optimality. For instance, it does not consider placing points in such a way that it generates all possible Manhattan distances between 0 and \(2(n-1)\) inclusively.

Therefore, the given program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) in all cases.

Reasoning: The program does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances by only placing points on the diagonal and the first row, thus not covering all possible distances.
