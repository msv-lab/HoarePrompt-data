The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a conventional throwaway variable in Python) and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.

Given that `t` is already stated to be an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
