You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all q across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `arr` contains tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`, `s` is the index of the last change in the sequence, `e` is 0, `num` is -1, and `i` is `N`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: - We cannot provide the exact numerical values of `nums` because they are not specified in the initial state.
        #    - Therefore, we describe the output in terms of the variable `nums`.
        #
        #Output:
    #State: `arr` contains tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`, `s` is the index of the last change in the sequence, `e` is 0, `num` is -1, `i` is `N`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` equals 23, then the conditions remain the same as described. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged as there is no else part.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: arr contains tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in nums, s is the index of the last change in the sequence, e is 0, num is -1, i is N, LA is len(arr) - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of `n` integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each integer in `a` is between 1 and 10^6. For each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` representing a range in the list `a`. The function returns the sum of the integers in the range from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
