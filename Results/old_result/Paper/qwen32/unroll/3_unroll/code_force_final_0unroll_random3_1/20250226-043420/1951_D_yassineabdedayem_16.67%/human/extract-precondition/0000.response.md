Precondition: **Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. There are multiple test cases, with the first line containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases.**
