The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `test_cases`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one integer for the loop to execute. The variable `t` is mentioned as an integer that represents the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000. Since `t` is the number of test cases, it should match the length of `test_cases`.

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must have at least one integer. The variable `x` will take on the value of each element in `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop. The `results` list being empty does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and the length of `test_cases` is at least 1, `results` is an empty list**
