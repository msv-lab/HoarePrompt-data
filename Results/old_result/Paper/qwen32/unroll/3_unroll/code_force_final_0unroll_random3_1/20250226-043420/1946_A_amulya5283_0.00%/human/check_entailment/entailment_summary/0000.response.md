### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given program and see if it correctly addresses the problem statement.

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array to easily find the current median. This is correct as the median is defined based on the sorted order of the array.

2. **Finding the Median:**
   - The median is located at the index `n // 2` in the sorted array. This is correct for both odd and even lengths of the array because Python's integer division and the problem's definition of median align here.

3. **Using a Min-Heap:**
   - The program uses a min-heap starting from the median index to keep track of the smallest elements that need to be increased. This is a clever way to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements until the median is increased.

4. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap. It keeps track of the number of operations needed to make the smallest element in the heap greater than the current median.

5. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program counts the number of operations required to increase the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. This count is the answer for each test case.

### Correctness:

The logic of the program seems correct based on the provided explanation and the problem statement. Here are some key points that support this:

- The program correctly identifies the median of the array.
- It uses a min-heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements.
- The number of operations counted is the minimum required to ensure the median increases.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
