The provided code snippet only initializes a new variable `cur` to 0. No other variables are affected or modified by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the initialization of `cur` to 0 while all other variables retain their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the sum of the original `a_i` and `i + 1`, satisfying 2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 + n; `counter` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `a`; `cur` is 0.**
