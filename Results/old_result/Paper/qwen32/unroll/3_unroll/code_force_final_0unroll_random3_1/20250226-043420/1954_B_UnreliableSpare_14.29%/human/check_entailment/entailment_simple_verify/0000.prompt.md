You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in handling the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Here's an example where the code does not work as expected:

Consider the test case:
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```
The expected output is `2`, because by removing two elements (e.g., the first and the last), the array becomes `[2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the given program will output `1`, which is incorrect.

Let's analyze the code:
1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
2. If not all elements are the same, it tries to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray that consists of the same element. It does this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive elements that are the same.
3. The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum count of such contiguous subarrays.
4. Finally, it prints `ans` as the result.

The problem with this approach is that it doesn't correctly account for the necessary removal of elements to break the "beautiful" property. It only considers contiguous subarrays of the same element but does not consider the overall structure of the array and the effect of removing elements on the "beautiful" property.

For example, in the test case `1 2 1 2 1 2`, the program will find the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of the same element, which is `1`, but removing just one element won't make the array non-beautiful. It needs to remove at least two elements to break the alternating pattern.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
