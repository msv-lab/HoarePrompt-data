### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to find the number of "beautiful pairs" (i, j) in an array `a` where `i < j` and two conditions are satisfied:
1. `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.

The given solution uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the count of pairs of residues `(num % x, num % y)` encountered so far. For each element `num` in the array, the solution calculates the required residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` and checks if there are any previously encountered pairs `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map`. If there are, it adds their count to the result. Then, it updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

Let's break down the logic:
- `r_x = -num % x` is used because we need `a[i] + a[j]` to be divisible by `x`. This can be rephrased as `a[i] % x + a[j] % x ≡ 0 (mod x)`, which implies `a[i] % x ≡ -a[j] % x (mod x)`.
- `r_y = num % y` is used because we need `a[i] - a[j]` to be divisible by `y`. This can be rephrased as `a[i] % y ≡ a[j] % y (mod y)`.

The solution iterates through the array once, and for each element, it performs dictionary lookups and updates, which are average O(1) operations. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem description. It efficiently uses a dictionary to track the necessary residues and counts, ensuring that it meets the performance requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
