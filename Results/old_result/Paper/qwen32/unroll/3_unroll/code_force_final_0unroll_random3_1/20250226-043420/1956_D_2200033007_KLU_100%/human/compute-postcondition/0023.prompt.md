You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Additionally, `length` is not equal to 1, and `max_value` is not equal to `length`. The sum of `arr[start_index]` and `func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`. The sum of `arr[end_index]` and `func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.

Additionally, `length` is not equal to 1, and `max_value` is not equal to `length`. The sum of `arr[start_index]` and `func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`.

Additionally, `length` is not equal to 1, and `max_value` is not equal to `length`. The sum of `arr[start_index]` and `func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`. The sum of `arr[end_index]` and `func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(arr). The function returns an empty list if `start_index` is greater than `end_index`. If `start_index` is within the bounds of the array and the element at `start_index` is less than or equal to 0, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. If `arr[start_index]` is greater than 0, the function recursively calls itself with `start_index + 1` and `end_index` if `start_index` is not equal to `end_index`, or with `start_index` and `end_index - 1` otherwise. If `start_index` equals `end_index` and `arr[start_index]` is greater than 0, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, end_index)`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns an empty list.

Case_2: The program returns [(start_index, start_index)] where start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < len(arr) and arr[start_index] is less than or equal to 0.

Case_3: The program returns a list containing one tuple, where the tuple consists of `start_index` and `end_index`.

Case_4: The program returns the value of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)`

Case_5: The program returns the value of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)`
