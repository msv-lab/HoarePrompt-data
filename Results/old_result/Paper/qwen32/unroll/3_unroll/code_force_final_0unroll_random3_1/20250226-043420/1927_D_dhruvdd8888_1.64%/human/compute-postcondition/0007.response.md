Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 2 * 10^5; for each test case, `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `N`; the sum of all `N` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional `-1` appended to it; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The list `nums` now has an additional `-1` appended to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
