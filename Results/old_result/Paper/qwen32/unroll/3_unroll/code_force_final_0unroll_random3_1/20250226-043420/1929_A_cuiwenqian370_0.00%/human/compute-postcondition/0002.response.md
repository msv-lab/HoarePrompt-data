The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `left`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and arr is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0.**
