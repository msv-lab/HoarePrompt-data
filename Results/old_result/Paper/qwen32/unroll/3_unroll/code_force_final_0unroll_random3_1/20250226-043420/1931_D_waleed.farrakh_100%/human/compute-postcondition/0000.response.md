The provided code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. It only reassigns the `input` variable to the function `sys.stdin.read`. This means that `input` can now be used to read from the standard input, but it does not affect the existing variables or their values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and `arr` is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`.**
