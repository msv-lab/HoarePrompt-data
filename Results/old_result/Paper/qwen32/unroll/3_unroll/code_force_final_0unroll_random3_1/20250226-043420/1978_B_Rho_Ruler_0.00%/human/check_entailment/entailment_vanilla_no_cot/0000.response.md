Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The binary search approach is not properly implemented to find the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price. The function `func_1` is also not correctly calculating the profit for a given \( k \).

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search is being used to find the maximum \( k \) such that the condition in `func_1` is met, but this condition does not directly relate to maximizing profit. Instead, the binary search should be used to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.

2. **Profit Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates a sum that does not represent the actual profit. The correct way to calculate the profit for a given \( k \) is to sum the prices of the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.

3. **Maximizing Profit**: The correct approach is to iterate over possible values of \( k \) and calculate the profit for each, then choose the maximum profit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible values of \( k \) from 0 to \(\min(n, b)\), calculates the profit for each \( k \), and keeps track of the maximum profit.
