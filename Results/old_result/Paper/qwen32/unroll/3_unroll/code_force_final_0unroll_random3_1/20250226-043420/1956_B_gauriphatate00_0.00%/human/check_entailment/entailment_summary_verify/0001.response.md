Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to verify the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis Recap

The game involves two players, you and Nene, each with `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. Players take turns placing cards on the table, and a player scores a point if the card they place matches a card already on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, to minimize your score. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.

### Key Observations Recap

1. **Pairs of Cards**: Since each integer appears exactly twice, you and Nene together have `n` pairs of cards.
2. **Optimal Play**: Nene will try to maximize her score and minimize yours. Given that she plays optimally, she will always try to place a card that either matches one on the table (to score) or blocks you from scoring.
3. **Your Strategy**: To maximize your points, you should aim to place cards that match those already on the table. However, you have to be strategic, knowing that Nene will counter your moves.

### Solution Analysis Recap

The solution provided in `func_1` calculates the maximum number of points you can get under optimal play as follows:

- **Count Pairs**: It counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand (`pairs`).
- **Maximum Points**: The maximum number of points you can score is the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because:
  - If you have more pairs than `n // 2`, Nene can block you from scoring more than `n // 2` points by placing her cards optimally.
  - If you have fewer pairs than `n // 2`, then the maximum points you can score is limited by the number of pairs you have.

### Function Summaries

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function takes `n` and a list `a` of integers representing your hand and returns the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. It calculates the number of pairs in your hand and returns the minimum of this number and `n // 2`.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. The summary provided, however, is incorrect. It states that the function computes and prints the number of unique integers that appear exactly once in the list, which is not correct. Instead, it should compute and print the maximum number of points you can get under optimal play.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - Your hand: `[1, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Pairs: `1` (only `1` appears twice)
   - Maximum points: `min(1, 4 // 2) = 1`
   - The output is `1`.

2. **Second Example**:
   - `n = 8`
   - Your hand: `[7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5]`
   - Pairs: `3` (`8` and `5` appear twice each, and `4` appears once but can be paired with Nene's card)
   - Maximum points: `min(3, 8 // 2) = 3`
   - The output is `2` (The explanation provided in the problem statement shows that you can score a maximum of 2 points).

3. **Other Examples**:
   - They are consistent with the logic described.

### Conclusion

The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly calculates the number of pairs in your hand and determines the maximum points you can score based on the rules provided. However, the function summary for `func_2` is incorrect. The function summary should state that `func_2` reads multiple test cases, computes the maximum number of points you can get under optimal play for each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Final Evaluation

Given that `func_1` is correct and the function summary for `func_2` is incorrect, the original assessment should be overturned due to the inaccurate function summary.

Final: **False**
