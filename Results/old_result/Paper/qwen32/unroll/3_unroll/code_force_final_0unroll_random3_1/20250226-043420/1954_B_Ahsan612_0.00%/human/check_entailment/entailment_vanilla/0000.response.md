Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are equal.

### Key Observations

1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: If an array is beautiful, it means that any element `a[i]` can be replaced by `a[i-1]` or `a[i+1]` if they are equal, and this operation can be repeated until all elements are the same.

2. **Stopping Condition**: To stop the array from being beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no way to make all elements the same by the given operation. This implies that we need to break the pattern of equal adjacent elements.

3. **Minimum Removal**: The minimum number of elements to remove corresponds to the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements in the array. Removing all but one element from this segment will prevent the array from being beautiful.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove by identifying the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements. Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same`: Keeps track of the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - `num`: Stores the current number being counted.
   - `minn`: Stores the minimum length of any segment of identical elements found so far, initialized to infinity.

2. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one.
   - If the current element is the same as the previous one, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update to `minn` to account for the last segment.

3. **Output**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there was only one segment (the entire array was the same), and it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern.

### Correctness

The solution correctly identifies the smallest segment of identical elements and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern. However, there is a subtle issue: the condition `if minn == inf` is incorrect. This condition will only be true if the array is empty, which is not a valid input scenario. Instead, the condition should check if the array consists of a single element or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array, indicating that the entire array is the same.

### Corrected Condition

The correct condition should be:
- If `minn` is equal to `n` (the length of the array), it means the entire array is the same, and it should print `-1`.

### Conclusion

Given the provided solution, it does not handle the case where the entire array is the same correctly. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
