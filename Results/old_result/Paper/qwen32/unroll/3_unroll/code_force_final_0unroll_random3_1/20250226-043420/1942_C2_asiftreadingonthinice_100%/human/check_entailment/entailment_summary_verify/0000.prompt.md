You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of chosen vertices on a line of `n` vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that represents the maximum number of additional vertices Bessie can choose, given the constraints of `x` (the number of initially chosen vertices), `y` (an additional parameter affecting the calculation), and the specific positions of the initially chosen vertices. The final output for each test case is the minimum of the calculated value and `n - 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and check if it covers all edge cases and meets the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of sides of the polygon.
     - `x`: Number of vertices Bessie has chosen.
     - `y`: Maximum number of additional vertices you can choose.
     - `a`: List of `x` vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

3. **Logic:**
   - The code aims to maximize the number of triangles by choosing up to `y` additional vertices.
   - It starts by sorting the list of chosen vertices.
   - It calculates the initial number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
   - It then considers gaps between chosen vertices and tries to fill them with additional vertices to form more triangles.
   
### Analysis of the Code:
- The code sorts the vertices and calculates the initial number of triangles as `x + y - 2`.
- It checks for gaps between consecutive vertices and calculates the potential number of triangles that can be formed by filling these gaps.
- It also considers the gap between the first and last chosen vertices, wrapping around the polygon.
- The code then iterates through the gaps, filling them with additional vertices to form more triangles until it runs out of additional vertices (`y`).

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Small Values:** When `n`, `x`, and `y` are small, the logic should correctly handle these cases.
   - **Large Values:** When `n` is large and `x` and `y` are small, the logic should still hold.
   - **Wrap-around Gaps:** The code correctly handles the wrap-around gap between the first and last chosen vertices.
   - **No Additional Vertices (`y = 0`):** The code should correctly handle cases where no additional vertices can be chosen.
   - **All Vertices Chosen (`x = n`):** The code should correctly handle cases where all vertices are already chosen.

2. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code seems to correctly handle the initial calculation of triangles.
   - It correctly identifies gaps and attempts to fill them to maximize triangles.
   - However, the final addition of `y` to `ans` seems suspicious. This might be an error as it doesn't consider the context of the gaps being filled.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider a few test cases to verify the correctness:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 2`
   - `a = [1, 6, 2, 5]`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Code Output: `6`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 7`, `x = 3`, `y = 1`
   - `a = [6, 4, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Code Output: `5`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 2`
   - `a = [1, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Code Output: `2`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 10`, `x = 5`, `y = 0`
   - `a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Code Output: `3`

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - `n = 10`, `x = 5`, `y = 5`
   - `a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - Code Output: `9`

### Conclusion:
The code seems to handle the provided test cases correctly. However, the final addition of `y` to `ans` without considering the context of the gaps being filled might be incorrect. This could lead to incorrect results in some edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The code might be incorrect due to the final addition of `y` to `ans` without considering the context of the gaps being filled. This could lead to incorrect results in some edge cases. For example, if `y` is greater than the number of additional vertices needed to fill the gaps, the final addition could result in an incorrect number of triangles.
