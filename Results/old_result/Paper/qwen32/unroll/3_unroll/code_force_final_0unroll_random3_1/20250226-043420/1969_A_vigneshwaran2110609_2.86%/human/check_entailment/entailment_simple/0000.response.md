### Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. Let's analyze the logic and the expectations:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Monocarp needs to invite friends such that at least 2 of them come to the party.
   - A friend `i` will come to the party only if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` of best friends.
   - The program then iterates over the list `p` and checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. This condition is incorrect and does not reflect the problem's requirement.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`.

3. **Issues**:
   - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is not meaningful in the context of the problem. It does not check if two friends can attend the party.
   - The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
- Identify pairs `(i, p_i)` where both friends can attend if both are invited.
- Determine the minimum number of invitations needed to cover at least two such pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the described problem. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
