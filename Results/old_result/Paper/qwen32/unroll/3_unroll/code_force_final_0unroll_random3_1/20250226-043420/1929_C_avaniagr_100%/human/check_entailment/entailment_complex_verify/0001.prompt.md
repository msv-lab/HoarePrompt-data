You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: A series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses corresponding to each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition involving `k`, `x`, and `a` is met and prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied or 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze the logic used to decide whether Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins given the constraints of the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
Sasha's goal is to determine if he can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n` by placing bets under the following conditions:
- If he wins, he receives `y * k` coins (his number of coins increases by `y * (k - 1)`).
- If he loses, he loses the entire bet amount (`y` coins).
- He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
- He starts with `a` coins.

### Strategy Analysis:
The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationship between the parameters `k`, `x`, and `a`.

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can afford to lose up to `x` times in a row. To ensure he can always recover and proceed, he needs at least `x + 1` coins initially. If he has fewer coins, he can't guarantee to recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can afford to lose up to `x` times in a row. To ensure he can always recover and proceed, he needs at least `x + 2` coins initially. This is because the recovery strategy requires more initial coins due to the higher risk of consecutive losses.

2. **General Case (x > k - 1):**
   - When `x` is greater than `k - 1`, the recovery strategy becomes more complex. The program calculates a threshold `z` which represents the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can recover from any sequence of losses up to `x` consecutive losses. This calculation involves iteratively adding the necessary coins to recover from each possible sequence of losses.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows the logic outlined above:
- For `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`.
- For `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`.
- For `x > k - 1`, it calculates the threshold `z` iteratively and checks if `a >= z`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the correctness of the program by comparing its logic with the problem requirements:
- The base cases are correctly implemented.
- The iterative calculation for `x > k - 1` seems to follow the logic of ensuring Sasha can recover from any sequence of losses up to `x` consecutive losses.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine whether Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n` given the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
