You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. The following line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of queries. The next q lines each contain two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of each query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: N is the integer input representing the length of the array a; q and the query boundaries l and r remain unchanged; nums is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended at the end; s is the index of the start of the last segment that was not recorded; e is 0; num is nums[N]; arr is a list of tuples representing segments of identical numbers found in nums.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: N is the integer input representing the length of the array a; q and the query boundaries l and r remain unchanged; nums is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended at the end; s is the index of the start of the last segment that was not recorded; e is 0; num is nums[N]; arr is a list of tuples representing segments of identical numbers found in nums; LA is the index of the last element in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array `a`. It also receives an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and for each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function returns the result of each query, which is not specified in the provided details but generally would involve some computation or retrieval based on the array `a` and the query boundaries `l` and `r`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
