You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of problems. This is followed by two lines: the first line contains a sorted list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and the second line contains a sorted list b of n integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: 1 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems, a sorted list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and a sorted list `b` of `n` integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9) representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether the proposed difficulties match the expected difficulties.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
