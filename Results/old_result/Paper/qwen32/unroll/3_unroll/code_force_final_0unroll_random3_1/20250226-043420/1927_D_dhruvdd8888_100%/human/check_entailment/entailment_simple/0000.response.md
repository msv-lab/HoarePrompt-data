### Reasoning:

The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by identifying segments of identical numbers in the array and then using binary search to find a suitable pair of indices for each query. However, there are several issues with the logic that make the program incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Appending a Dummy Element**:
   - The program appends `-1` to the end of the `nums` array to handle the last segment. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect segment boundaries.

2. **Segment Creation**:
   - The program creates segments of identical numbers in the `arr` list. However, the logic for handling and querying these segments is flawed.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after the query's left boundary. However, the logic for determining the correct pair of indices `(i, j)` is incorrect. Specifically, the conditions for printing `-1 -1` and the correct pairs are not correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where all elements in the queried range are the same.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Appending `-1`**:
  - By appending `-1` to `nums`, the last segment might be incorrectly identified, especially if the last element of the array is `-1` or if the array ends with a series of identical elements.

- **Segment Identification**:
  - The segments are correctly identified, but the logic for determining the correct pair of indices for each query is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for printing `-1 -1` and the correct pairs are not correctly implemented.

- **Query Logic**:
  - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after the query's left boundary. However, the logic for determining the correct pair of indices `(i, j)` is incorrect. For example, the condition `if s > l:` is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where the segment starts after `l` but the previous segment might contain a suitable pair.

### Correctness:

Given the issues outlined above, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
