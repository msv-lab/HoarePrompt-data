In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use inside the loop. The only variable in the loop head is `t`. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only one that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be a positive integer since the loop will run `t` times. Given that `t` is described as "an input integer" and the problem specifies "There are multiple test cases," we can infer that `t` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

The state of `n` and `k` are mentioned as part of each test case but are not in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{18})**
