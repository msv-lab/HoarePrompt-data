You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, x and y are the integers from the last input pair, and 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` and prints the smaller of the two followed by the larger one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The task is to read a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, read two integers `x` and `y`. The program should then output the minimum and maximum of these two integers.

Let's break down the provided program:

1. The first line `x = int(input())` reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. The `for` loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
3. Inside the loop, `(x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers for each test case.
4. The `if` statement checks if `x < y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
5. If the `if` condition is false, the `else` statement prints `y` followed by `x`.

The logic of the program correctly outputs the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` first and `y` second, which is the correct order (minimum first, maximum second). If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it prints `y` first and `x` second, which is also the correct order.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. It handles all possible cases of input values for `x` and `y` within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
