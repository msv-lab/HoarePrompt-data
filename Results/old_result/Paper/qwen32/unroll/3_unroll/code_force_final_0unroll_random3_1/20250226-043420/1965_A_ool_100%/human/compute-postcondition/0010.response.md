The code snippet `A = not A` flips the boolean value of `A`. Initially, `A` is True if the number of elements in `set_` minus 1 is odd, and False otherwise. After the code executes, `A` will be False if it was initially True, and True if it was initially False. The value of `not_c` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`A` is False if the number of elements in `set_` minus 1 is odd, otherwise `A` is True; `not_c` is True**.
