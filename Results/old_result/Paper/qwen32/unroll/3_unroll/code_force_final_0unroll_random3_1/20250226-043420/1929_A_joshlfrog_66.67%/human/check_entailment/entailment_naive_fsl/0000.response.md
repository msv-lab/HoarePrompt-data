Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty as defined in the problem statement.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The program will output `2` (which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values), but the correct maximum beauty is `2` (which is calculated as (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2). However, the program does not guarantee this for all cases.

Let's consider another test case:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program will output `89` (which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values), but the correct maximum beauty is `57` (which can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order: 100, 90, 80, 54, 43, and calculating the beauty as (90-100) + (80-90) + (54-80) + (43-54) = -10 -10 -26 -11 = 57).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum beauty for all cases.
