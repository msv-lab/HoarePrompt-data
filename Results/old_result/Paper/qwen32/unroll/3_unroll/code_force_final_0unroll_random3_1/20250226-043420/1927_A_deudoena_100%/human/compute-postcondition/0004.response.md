The code snippet initializes an empty list `l`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables, while `l` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10; `s` is a new input string consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list.**
