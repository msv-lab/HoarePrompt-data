Let's break down the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a`. A pair of indices `<i, j>` is considered beautiful if:
- `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
- `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

### Key Observations:
- For the condition `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, we need `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x) ≡ 0 (mod x)`.
- For the condition `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, we need `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y) ≡ 0 (mod y)` which simplifies to `(a_i % y) ≡ (a_j % y) (mod y)`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(test_cases)`: This function processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` to get results.

#### `func_1(test_cases)`:
- It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` pairs.
- For each element `a` in the array, it calculates `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
- It then checks if `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of `(rx, ry)` to the count of beautiful pairs.
- It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
- Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list.

#### `func_2()`:
- This function reads the input, parses the test cases, and calls `func_1` to compute the results.
- It prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly computes `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` to ensure that the modulo operation yields a non-negative result.
- It correctly checks the condition for beautiful pairs using the modulo properties mentioned above.
- The frequency dictionary `freq` is used efficiently to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
- The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the results correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
