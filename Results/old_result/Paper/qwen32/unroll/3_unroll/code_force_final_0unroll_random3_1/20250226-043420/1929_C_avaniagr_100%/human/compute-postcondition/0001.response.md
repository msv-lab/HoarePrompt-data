To determine the Output State after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code provided. The code reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case based on the conditions provided, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each case.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - If `x < k - 1`:
     - It checks if `a` is at least `x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.
   - If `x == k - 1`:
     - It checks if `a` is at least `x + 2`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.
   - If `x > k - 1`:
     - It initializes `z` to `k - 2` and iterates `x - k + 3` times, updating `z` in each iteration as `z = z + z // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - After the loop, it checks if `a` is at least `z`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the code prints either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the nature of the problem, the "Output State" is not a set of variable values but rather a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses corresponding to each test case. Since the output is determined by the input values and the logic of the code, the output state can be described as a list of these responses.

However, the problem asks for a format similar to the initial execution state. Since the output is a series of responses and not variable values, we can describe the final state as the accumulated responses.

To summarize, the Output State can be described as the list of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each test case.

Output State: **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses corresponding to each test case.**
