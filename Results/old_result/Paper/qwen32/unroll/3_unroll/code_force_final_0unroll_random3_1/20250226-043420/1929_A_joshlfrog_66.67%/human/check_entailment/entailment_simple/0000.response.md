Reasoning:  
The program is intended to determine the maximum beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the optimal arrangement of the array would be to sort it in ascending or descending order. In both cases, the beauty of the array is equivalent to the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array.

The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum values in the array using a simple loop and then calculates the difference between these two values. This approach is valid because the maximum beauty can be achieved by placing the smallest number at the start and the largest number at the end in any arrangement, and all other numbers in between do not affect the overall beauty in terms of maximizing the sum of differences.

The provided program executes this logic correctly for each test case and prints the result, which matches the requirement.

Correctness: **True**
