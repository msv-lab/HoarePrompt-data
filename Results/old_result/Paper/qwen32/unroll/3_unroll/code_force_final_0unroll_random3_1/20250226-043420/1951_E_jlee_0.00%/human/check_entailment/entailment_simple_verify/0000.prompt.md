You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines of results, each corresponding to one of the `t` test cases. For each test case, the output is either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by additional information if 'YES'. The 'NO' output indicates that it's not possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the first character of the first part is not equal to the last character of the second part, and the string cannot be split into two parts with a character that appears only once in the middle. The 'YES' output is followed by the number of splits needed (either 1 or 2) and the split strings if applicable. The state of the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` are not preserved between iterations and are reset for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to produce a valid partition when the string can indeed be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
abacaba

Expected Output:
YES
3
aba cab a
```

### Why the Program Fails:
The program checks for some specific patterns in the string and attempts to partition it based on those patterns. However, it does not handle all possible cases where a valid partition exists. For the string `abacaba`, the program will incorrectly output `NO` instead of finding a valid partition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should attempt to find a partition where each substring is not a palindrome. A simple strategy is to split the string into substrings of length 2 or more, ensuring that each substring is not a palindrome. This approach works because any substring of length 2 or more can be made non-palindromic by ensuring it has at least two different characters.

### Correct Example:
For the string `abacaba`, a valid partition could be `aba cab a`. Each of these substrings is not a palindrome.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to handle all potential cases and does not produce a valid partition for some inputs, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
