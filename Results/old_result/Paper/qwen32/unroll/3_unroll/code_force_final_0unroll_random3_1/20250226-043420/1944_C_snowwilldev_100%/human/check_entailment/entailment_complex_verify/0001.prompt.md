You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

- Annotated Code:

    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: - After the loop finishes, `cnt` will contain the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. Each key in `cnt` corresponds to a unique integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list.
    #
    #Given this understanding, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: the loop returns `N`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it returns the smallest integer from `0` to `n` that either appears exactly once in the list or does not appear at all.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a game played by Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Alice appends an element from `a` to array `c` and removes it from `a`, while Bob simply removes an element from `a` without adding it to `c`. The game ends when `a` is empty. The score of the game is the MEX of `c`, and Alice wants to maximize it while Bob wants to minimize it. We need to determine the final score if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
    - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
    - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **Game Dynamics**:
    - Alice can force the MEX to be at least `k` if she can ensure that the first `k` non-negative integers are present in `c`.
    - Bob can prevent the MEX from being `k` if he can ensure that not all the first `k` non-negative integers are present in `c`.

### Strategy
- **Count Occurrences**: Count the occurrences of each number in `a`.
- **Determine MEX**:
    - If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once in `a`, Alice can ensure that these numbers are in `c`, maximizing the MEX.
    - Otherwise, Bob can force the MEX to be lower by strategically removing elements.

### Code Analysis
Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly implements the above strategy.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The code correctly counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a `defaultdict`.
2. **Determining MEX**:
    - The variable `t` counts the number of unique numbers that appear exactly once.
    - The loop iterates through numbers from `0` to `N` and checks the count of each number.
    - If a number appears exactly once, `t` is incremented.
    - If `t` reaches `2`, it means there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, and the MEX is the current number `i`.
    - If a number does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), the MEX is the current number `i`.

### Correctness
The logic in the code correctly determines the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here's the reasoning:
- If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, Alice can ensure that these numbers are in `c`, maximizing the MEX.
- If no such numbers exist, Bob can force the MEX to be lower by removing elements that would otherwise be unique.

Thus, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
