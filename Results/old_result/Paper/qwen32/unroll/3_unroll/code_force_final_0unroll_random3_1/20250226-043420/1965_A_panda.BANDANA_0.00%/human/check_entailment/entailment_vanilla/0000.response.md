Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where players remove a positive integer number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the constraint that the number of stones removed from each pile must be the same. The player who cannot make a move loses. The key to solving this problem lies in the observation that the game state can be analyzed using the concept of the Nim-sum (XOR-sum of the pile sizes).

However, the problem can be simplified by observing the following:
- If there is at least one pile with exactly 1 stone, Alice will always lose if both play optimally. This is because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves until Alice is forced to take the last stone from the pile of 1.
- If there are no piles with exactly 1 stone, Alice will always win. This is because she can always make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine the winner based on the above observations:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        e = set(l)
        m = len(l)
        if 1 in l:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of piles `n`.
   - It reads the list of stones in each pile `l`.
   - It creates a set `e` from the list `l`. This set is not used anywhere in the program, so it is redundant.
   - It checks if `1` is in the list `l`.
   - If `1` is in `l`, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the winner based on the presence of a pile with exactly 1 stone. If there is at least one pile with 1 stone, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This matches the simplified winning condition derived from the problem analysis.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
