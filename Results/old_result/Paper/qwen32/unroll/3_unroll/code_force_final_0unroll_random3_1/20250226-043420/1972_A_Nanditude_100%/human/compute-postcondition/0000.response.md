Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of problems. This is followed by two lines: the first line contains a sorted list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and the second line contains a sorted list b of n integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 100. `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases.**

In simpler terms, the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, and all other conditions and lists remain as described in the initial state.
