Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to decode an encoded string based on the described algorithm. However, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding process. The function seems to be trying to map each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' and then decoding based on this mapping, which is not what the problem requires.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**: The function `func_1` is constructing a mapping from characters in the encoded string to unique characters from 'a' to 'z'. This is not the correct approach for decoding. The problem requires mapping each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters from the original string.

2. **Incorrect Decoding Logic**: The function `func_1` is appending characters to the decoded list based on the constructed mapping. This mapping does not reflect the symmetric relationship described in the problem statement.

3. **Lack of Symmetric Mapping**: The function does not create an auxiliary string `r` of unique characters from the encoded string and then map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in `r`.

To correctly implement the decoding process, the function should:
- Create a set of unique characters from the encoded string.
- Sort these unique characters to form the auxiliary string `r`.
- Map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in `r`.
- Construct the decoded string based on this mapping.

Given the above reasons, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
