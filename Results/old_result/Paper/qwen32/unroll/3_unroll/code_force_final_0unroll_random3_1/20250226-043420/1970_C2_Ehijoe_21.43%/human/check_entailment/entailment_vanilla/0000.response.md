To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Game Setup**: The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes. There are `t` rounds, but in this version, `t=1`. Each round starts with a stone on a specific node.
- **Game Rules**: Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighboring node. The player who cannot make a move loses.
- **Objective**: Determine the winner if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- **Leaf Nodes**: In a tree, leaf nodes are nodes with only one connection. If the stone starts on a leaf, the player who starts (Ron) will lose because there is only one move possible, and it will leave the opponent with no moves.
- **Odd vs Even Distances**: The game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even) of the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes. If there is at least one odd distance, Ron wins because he can force a move that leaves an even number of moves for Hermione, ensuring he can always make a move until Hermione is left with no moves. If all distances are even, Hermione wins because Ron will be left with no moves after an optimal play.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the distances from a given starting node to all leaf nodes in the tree.
   - It recursively explores the tree, calculating distances by adding 1 for each step taken from the parent node.
   - It returns a list of distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the starting node.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
   - It checks if there is any odd distance in the list of distances. If there is, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

### Verification:
- The logic in the code correctly implements the strategy based on the parity of distances to leaf nodes.
- The code handles the tree structure and correctly identifies leaf nodes.
- The input parsing and output generation are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
