The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n_cases`. If `n_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state `n_cases` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4), which ensures that the loop will execute if it is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function.

Thus, the only requirement is that `n_cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variables `t` and `n` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is not set (will be initialized by the loop)**

However, to be more precise and in line with the provided examples, we can specify that `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins:

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
