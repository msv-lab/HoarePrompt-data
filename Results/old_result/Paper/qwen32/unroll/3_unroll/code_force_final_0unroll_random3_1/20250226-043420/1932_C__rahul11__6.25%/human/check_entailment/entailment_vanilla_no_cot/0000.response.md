Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program contains a logical error in how it updates the product of the array elements as commands are processed. Specifically, the line `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD` are incorrect because they assume integer division (`//`) will correctly reverse multiplication, which is not the case in modular arithmetic. Instead, you need to use modular multiplicative inverses to correctly handle division in modular arithmetic.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mod_inverse(a, m):
    m0, x0, x1 = m, 0, 1
    if m == 1:
        return 0
    while a > 1:
        # q is quotient
        q = a // m
        m, a = a % m, m
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    # Make x1 positive
    if x1 < 0:
        x1 += m0
    return x1

def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[l], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[r], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the `mod_inverse` function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number, which is used to correctly "divide" by an element in the array when updating the product. This ensures that the product is correctly maintained under modular arithmetic as elements are removed from the array according to the commands.
