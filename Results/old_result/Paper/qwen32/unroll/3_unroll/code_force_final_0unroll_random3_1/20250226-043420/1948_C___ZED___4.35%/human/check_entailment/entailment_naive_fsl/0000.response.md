Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Handling of the last column in the second row:**
   ```python
   if b[-2] != '>':
       print('NO')
   ```
   The code checks if the second-to-last arrow in the second row is not pointing to the right (`>`). If it's not, the robot cannot reach the final cell (2, n). However, this check is insufficient because the robot can potentially reach the final cell even if the second-to-last arrow in the second row is not pointing to the right, depending on the arrows in the first row and the overall grid configuration.

2. **Handling of the first column:**
   ```python
   elif n == 1:
       print('YES')
   ```
   This condition is incorrect because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2 (as per the problem statement). Hence, this condition will never be true.

3. **Checking alternating columns in the second row:**
   ```python
   no_path = True
   for k in range(0, n, 2):
       if b[k] != '>':
           no_path = False
   ```
   This loop checks if all even-indexed columns in the second row have arrows pointing to the right. If not, `no_path` is set to `False`. However, this check is not sufficient because the robot can move up or down between rows, and the arrows in the first row can affect the robot's ability to reach the final cell.

4. **Checking alternating columns in the first row:**
   ```python
   if not no_path:
       no_path = True
       for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
           print(k)
           if a[k] != '>':
               no_path = False
   ```
   This loop checks if all odd-indexed columns in the first row have arrows pointing to the right. If not, `no_path` is set to `False`. Similar to the previous check, this is not sufficient because the robot can move up or down between rows, and the arrows in the second row can affect the robot's ability to reach the final cell.

5. **Printing the result:**
   ```python
   if no_path:
       print('YES')
   else:
       print('NO')
   ```
   The final result is printed based on the `no_path` flag. However, the logic leading to the setting of `no_path` is incorrect, as discussed above.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement based on the arrows in both rows and ensure that it can reach the final cell (2, n). The current logic does not account for all possible paths and configurations, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><<>
><<>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this example, the robot can start at (1, 1), move to (2, 1), then to (2, 2), then to (1, 2), then to (1, 3), then to (2, 3), and finally to (2, 4). However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement.
