### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, using the annotations to validate the behavior of the program.

**Problem Recap:**
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful.
- An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are equal.
- If the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, we should return -1.

**Key Observations:**
- To stop the array from being beautiful, we need to break the pattern of equal adjacent elements.
- The minimum number of elements to remove corresponds to the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements in the array.

**Code Analysis:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - `same`: Keeps track of the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - `num`: Stores the current number being counted.
   - `minn`: Stores the minimum length of any segment of identical elements found so far, initialized to infinity.

2. **Loop Through Array:**
   - The loop iterates through the array, comparing each element to the previous one.
   - If the current element is the same as the previous one, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update to `minn` to account for the last segment.

3. **Output:**
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there was only one segment (the entire array was the same), and it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern.

**Annotations:**
- The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, showing how `same`, `num`, and `minn` are updated during the loop.

**Correctness:**
- The annotations and the code logic correctly identify the smallest segment of identical elements.
- The condition `if minn == inf` is incorrect because it will never be true given the problem constraints (the array is guaranteed to be beautiful and contain at least one element).
- The correct condition should be: if `minn` is equal to `n` (the length of the array), it means the entire array is the same, and it should print `-1`.

**Verification:**
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the condition `if minn == inf`.
- The code needs to be adjusted to check if `minn` is equal to `n` to correctly handle the case where the entire array is the same.

**Conclusion:**
- Given the provided solution, it does not handle the case where the entire array is the same correctly. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
