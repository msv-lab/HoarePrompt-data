Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The code seems to be trying to find the smallest group of consecutive identical elements in the array, but this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

Let's analyze the code and the problem statement:
- The code iterates through the array and counts consecutive identical elements.
- It keeps track of the minimum size of such consecutive sequences.
- If the minimum size is found, it prints that size as the result.
- If the array consists of all identical elements, it prints `-1`.

However, this approach is incorrect for several reasons:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. This means we need to break the pattern of the array where `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` for any `i` such that `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`.
2. Simply finding the smallest group of consecutive identical elements does not guarantee that removing those elements will make the array stop being beautiful.
3. There could be cases where removing a different set of elements is required to break the beautiful property.

Let's consider a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 2 1

Output:
1
Expected Output:
2
```

Explanation of the counterexample:
- The array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` is beautiful because we can perform the operation on index 2 (replacing `3` with `2`), resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, and further operations can make it `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- However, the code will output `1` because the smallest group of consecutive identical elements is of size `1` (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, `2`, `1`).
- To make the array stop being beautiful, we need to remove at least two elements, for example, removing the first and last elements, resulting in `[2, 3, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct answer is `False`.
