You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and x is the integer value from the last test case (2 <= x <= 1000).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem based on the given description.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. If there are multiple values of \( y \) that achieve this maximum, any one of them is acceptable.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \). It then calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) and prints it.

### Reasoning:
1. **Intuition Behind \( y = x // 2 \)**:
   - The intuition behind choosing \( y = x // 2 \) is that it is often a good candidate for maximizing \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) because it is the largest possible value of \( y \) that is less than \( x \) and it shares many factors with \( x \).
   - However, this does not guarantee that \( y = x // 2 \) will always yield the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

2. **Checking Specific Cases**:
   - Let's check the provided example cases to see if the program's output is correct.
     - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \). Here, \(\gcd(10, 5) = 5\), so \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\). This is indeed the maximum possible value.
     - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 7 // 2 = 3 \). Here, \(\gcd(7, 3) = 1\), so \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 4\). The maximum possible value is actually with \( y = 6 \) (since \(\gcd(7, 6) = 1\), so \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7\)).
     - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \). Here, \(\gcd(21, 10) = 1\), so \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 11\). The maximum possible value is actually with \( y = 18 \) (since \(\gcd(21, 18) = 3\), so \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 21\)).
     - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 100 // 2 = 50 \). Here, \(\gcd(100, 50) = 50\), so \(\gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 100\). This is indeed the maximum possible value.
     - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 2 // 2 = 1 \). Here, \(\gcd(2, 1) = 1\), so \(\gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2\). This is indeed the maximum possible value.
     - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 1000 // 2 = 500 \). Here, \(\gcd(1000, 500) = 500\), so \(\gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 1000\). This is indeed the maximum possible value.
     - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 6 // 2 = 3 \). Here, \(\gcd(6, 3) = 3\), so \(\gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6\). The maximum possible value is actually with \( y = 5 \) (since \(\gcd(6, 5) = 1\), so \(\gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 6\)).

From the above analysis, we can see that while the program works for some cases, it does not always yield the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee to find the integer \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is not correct.
