Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array where all elements are the same through a series of operations where an element can be replaced by its neighbor if the neighbor on both sides is the same.

### Key Points

1. **Beautiful Array**: An array where, through a series of operations, all elements can be made the same.
2. **Operation**: Choose an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and replace `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.
3. **Objective**: Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. If it's impossible, return -1.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution follows these steps:

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, read the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
2. **Check Single Element Arrays**: If the array has only one element, it is already non-beautiful, so the answer is `-1`.
3. **Check Uniform Arrays**: If all elements in the array are the same (`len(set(a)) == 1`), it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, so the answer is `-1`.
4. **Count Consecutive Elements**: For arrays with more than one unique element, the solution counts the maximum length of consecutive identical elements. The minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is the length of the longest sequence of identical elements minus one. This is because removing all but one element from the longest sequence will make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness Analysis

The solution provided does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here are the issues:

- **Handling Uniform Arrays**: The solution correctly identifies uniform arrays as impossible to make non-beautiful and returns `-1`, which is correct.
- **Handling Non-Uniform Arrays**: The solution incorrectly assumes that removing all but one element from the longest sequence of identical elements will make the array non-beautiful. This is not necessarily true. The problem requires the array to be non-beautiful after operations, not just by removing elements from a sequence.

### Counterexample

Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`:
- The longest sequence of identical elements is `1` and `2`, each of length 3.
- According to the solution, the answer would be `2` (removing 2 elements from the longest sequence).
- However, removing any one element from this array (e.g., the middle `2`), results in `[1, 2, 1, 1]`, which is still beautiful because you can perform operations to make all elements `1`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It fails to account for the operations allowed and only considers the longest sequence of identical elements.

**Correctness: False**
