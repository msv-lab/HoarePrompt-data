Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, the function receives three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) where a and b are the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m is the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky after launch.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, representing the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints for the test cases (including the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
