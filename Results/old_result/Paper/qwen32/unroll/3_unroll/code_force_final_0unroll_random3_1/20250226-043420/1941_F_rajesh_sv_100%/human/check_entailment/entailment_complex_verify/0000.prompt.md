You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are some specific problems:

1. **Incorrect Memoization Implementation:**
   - The `func_1` and `wrapper` functions are supposed to implement memoization, but they are not used correctly in the code. The `wrapper` function is not even defined properly since `d` is a local variable inside `func_1` and cannot be accessed in `wrapper`. This part of the code is not only unused but also incorrectly implemented.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle some edge cases properly. For example, when the new problem complexity `d_i + f_j` is less than the smallest element in `A` or greater than the largest element in `A`, the code does not correctly update the imbalance. Specifically, the code does not consider the possibility of adding a new problem that could reduce the imbalance by changing the smallest or largest gap in `A`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Imbalance:**
   - The code calculates the potential new imbalance by considering only the gaps between `left` and `right` and does not consider the potential new gaps that could be created by inserting the new problem at the beginning or end of the list `A`. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the optimal solution involves adding a problem with a complexity less than `A[0]` or greater than `A[n-1]`.

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2 2
1 10 20
1 15
1 1
```
- The current imbalance is `20 - 1 = 19` and `10 - 1 = 9`, so the maximum imbalance is `19`.
- By adding a problem with complexity `1 + 1 = 2`, the new list becomes `[1, 2, 10, 20]` and the new imbalances are `2 - 1 = 1`, `10 - 2 = 8`, and `20 - 10 = 10`. The maximum imbalance is now `10`.
- By adding a problem with complexity `15 + 1 = 16`, the new list becomes `[1, 10, 16, 20]` and the new imbalances are `10 - 1 = 9`, `16 - 10 = 6`, and `20 - 16 = 4`. The maximum imbalance is now `9`.
- The correct answer should be `4`, but the code might not correctly handle this case.

Given these issues, the code is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
