Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. The program has several issues:

1. **Logic for Choosing Remaining Videos**: The program attempts to balance the number of 'F' and 'S' videos based on the initial count of 'F' and 'S' videos for each scenario. However, it does not consider the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) videos of the same type should appear consecutively for any permutation.

2. **Handling of Undecided Videos**: The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to undecided videos based on whether the scenario is in the first \(\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor - 1\) scenarios of the 'sa' or 'sb' lists. This logic is not sufficient to ensure the required constraint is met.

3. **General Strategy**: The program does not employ a strategy that ensures the constraint is met for all permutations. It simply tries to balance the number of 'F' and 'S' videos, which is not sufficient.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible approach is to use a backtracking algorithm or a similar method to assign 'F' and 'S' to the undecided videos while ensuring that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is satisfied for all permutations. This would involve checking each possible sequence of scenarios and ensuring the constraint is not violated.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct.
