You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and arr is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the last test case processed, `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing all test cases, and `idx` is `1 + 2*t`.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from the initial state, `test_cases` remains the same list of tuples, `idx` remains `1 + 2*t`, and `results` is the output of `func_1(test_cases)`. The loop has printed each element of `results` to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), two integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and a list of integers `arr` of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided output description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
