t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10⁵ and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10⁴. The array a consists of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10⁴. The string s consists of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10⁵.
