Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze why:

1. For \(n = 2\), the program outputs:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   ```
   The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct.

2. For \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   2 3
   ```
   The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), which is correct.

3. For \(n \geq 4\), the program starts with:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   2 4
   ```
   and then continues with \((j, j)\) for each \(j\) from 4 to \(n\). This does not maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\) because it does not consider all possible distinct Manhattan distances efficiently.

   For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   2 4
   4 4
   ```
   The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), but a better arrangement could be:
   ```
   1 1
   1 3
   4 3
   4 4
   ```
   which gives the Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).

The given program does not provide an optimal solution for \(n \geq 4\) as it does not explore all possible configurations that could maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
