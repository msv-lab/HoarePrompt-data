You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

    #State: a series of three lowercase letters for each test case, based on the value of `lex` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `lex` between 1 and 78. For each test case, it outputs a sequence of three lowercase letters derived from the value of `lex`. The letters are determined by converting parts of `lex` into their corresponding positions in the alphabet.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that corresponds to a given encoded sum. The encoded sum is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. For example, the word "cat" encodes to 24 (3 + 1 + 20). The goal is to find the smallest possible word (in lexicographical order) that could result in this sum.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer (`lex`), which represents the encoded sum.

2. **Generating the Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to fill the first two positions of the word:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` (representing 'a') and reduces `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` (representing 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
     - Otherwise, it also appends 26 to `arr` (representing 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr` (representing the third letter).

3. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The program sorts the list `arr` to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.
   - It then converts each number in `arr` to its corresponding letter (by adding 96 to the number and converting it to a character) and prints them.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Values:**
  - The program's logic for handling values of `lex` is flawed. For example, if `lex` is 78, the correct word should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26), but the program will incorrectly handle the values and may not produce the correct result.
- **Logic for Lexicographical Order:**
  - The sorting step is not needed if the program correctly generates the letters in the first place. The goal is to generate the smallest possible letters first, which is not guaranteed by this approach.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle the smallest possible sum (3, corresponding to "aaa") correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
