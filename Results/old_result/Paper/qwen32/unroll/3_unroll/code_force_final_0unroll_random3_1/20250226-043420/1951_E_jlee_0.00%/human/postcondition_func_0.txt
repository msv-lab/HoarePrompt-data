The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it can be split into two non-empty parts such that the first character of the first part is not equal to the last character of the second part, or if it can be split into two parts with a character that appears only once in the middle. It outputs 'YES' followed by the number of splits needed and the split strings if possible, or 'NO' if such a split is not possible.
