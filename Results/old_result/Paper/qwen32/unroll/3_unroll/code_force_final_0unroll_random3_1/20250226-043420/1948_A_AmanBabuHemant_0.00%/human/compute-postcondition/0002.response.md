To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the code given the initial state and the loop's logic.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value provided by the user input, and `1 <= t <= 50`. In each iteration:
- A new integer `n` is read from the input.
- If `n` is odd, the program prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` consisting of the substring '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
  - If the length of `s` is less than 200, the program prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The loop does not modify the value of `t` or any other variable outside the loop's scope. It only processes each `n` independently in each iteration.

After all iterations, the output state will be determined by the outputs generated during each iteration. Since the output is printed during each iteration and not stored, the final "output state" in terms of variable values remains the same as the initial state except for the outputs that have been printed.

Thus, the output state can be described as the state after all iterations have completed, with the only changes being the printed outputs.

Output State: **the program will have printed 'NO' or 'YES' followed by a string of '110's for each input `n` depending on whether `n` is odd or even and if the constructed string's length is less than 200. The value of `t` remains unchanged.**
