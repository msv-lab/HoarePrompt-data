Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The code attempts to count combinations but does not correctly apply the triangle inequality theorem, which is essential for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

For three sticks with lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \le b \le c\)), they can form a non-degenerate triangle if and only if \(a + b > c\). The code does not check this condition and instead incorrectly assumes that any three sticks of the same length or different lengths can form a triangle, which is not the case.

Here is a corrected version of the code that properly checks the triangle inequality:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [2**x for x in a]
        a.sort()
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            k = i + 2
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                while k < n and a[i] + a[j] > a[k]:
                    k += 1
                count += k - j - 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This version of the code first converts the exponents to stick lengths, sorts them, and then uses a nested loop with a two-pointer technique to count the number of valid combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality.
