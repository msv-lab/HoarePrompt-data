You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it can be split into two non-empty parts such that the first character of the first part is not equal to the last character of the second part, or if it can be split into two parts with a character that appears only once in the middle. It outputs 'YES' followed by the number of splits needed and the split strings if possible, or 'NO' if such a split is not possible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to determine if a given string can be partitioned into substrings such that no substring is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, the program should output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the partition itself. If no such partition exists, it should output "NO".

### Key Points
1. **Single Character Strings**: A single character string is always a palindrome, so the output should be "NO".
2. **Non-Palindrome Strings**: If the string is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into one part (the string itself) and the answer is "YES".
3. **All Characters Same**: If all characters in the string are the same, no partition can avoid having palindromic parts, so the answer should be "NO".
4. **Handling Palindromes**: If the string is a palindrome, the program must find a way to partition it into non-palindromic parts.

### Program Analysis
The program starts by reading the number of test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. **Single Character Check**: If the string length is 1, it immediately prints "NO".
2. **First and Last Character Check**: If the first and last characters are different, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single part.
3. **All Characters Same Check**: If all characters are the same, it prints "NO".
4. **Single Character Different Check**: If all but one character are the same, it checks if the middle character (if the string length is odd) is different. If it is, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single part.
5. **General Case**: For other cases, it checks for the first position where the characters from the start and end do not match. If found, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single part. If not, it tries to find a valid partition by checking for changes in the sequence of characters.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Handling of Palindromes**: The program does not correctly handle all cases of palindromes. For example, it might incorrectly identify a string as non-palindromic when it is actually a palindrome.
2. **Partitioning Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic parts is flawed. It does not guarantee that the resulting parts are non-palindromic.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle some edge cases correctly, such as strings with repeating patterns but not being entirely the same character.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified in the program's logic and handling of edge cases, the program is not guaranteed to correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
