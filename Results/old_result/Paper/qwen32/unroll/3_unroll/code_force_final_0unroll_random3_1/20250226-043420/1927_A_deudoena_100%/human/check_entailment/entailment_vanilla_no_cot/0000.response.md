Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The program's logic is flawed, as it only considers the first and last black cells and calculates the distance between them plus two, which does not necessarily give the correct answer.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the minimum length of a segment that, when painted white, will cover all black cells. This can be done by simply counting the length of the longest sequence of consecutive black cells in the string. Here's the correct approach:

1. For each test case, read the length of the strip and the strip itself.
2. Find the longest sequence of consecutive 'B' characters in the strip.
3. The length of this sequence is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_black_streak = 0
    current_black_streak = 0
    for j in s:
        if j == 'B':
            current_black_streak += 1
            if current_black_streak > max_black_streak:
                max_black_streak = current_black_streak
        else:
            current_black_streak = 0
    print(max_black_streak)
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white for each test case.
