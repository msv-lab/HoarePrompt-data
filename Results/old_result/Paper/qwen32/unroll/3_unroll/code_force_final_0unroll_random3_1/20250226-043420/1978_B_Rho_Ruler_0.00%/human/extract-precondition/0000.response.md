Precondition: **k, a, b, and n are integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**

Note: The problem description indicates that `k` is chosen by Bob and should be within the range `0` to `min(n, b)`, while `n`, `a`, and `b` are given as part of each test case and should be within the range `1` to `10^9`. However, the function definition provided (`def func_1(k, a, b, n):`) suggests that `k` is an input parameter, which is not the case as per the problem description. Typically, `k` would be determined within the function based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Assuming the intention is to define a function that takes `n`, `a`, and `b` as inputs and calculates the maximum profit, the correct function signature would be `def func_1(n, a, b):`.
