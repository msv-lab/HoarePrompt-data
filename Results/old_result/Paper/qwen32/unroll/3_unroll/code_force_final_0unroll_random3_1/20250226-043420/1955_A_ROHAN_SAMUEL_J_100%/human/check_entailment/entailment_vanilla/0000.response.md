To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the prices `a` (for one yogurt) and `b` (for two yogurts under promotion).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the provided program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It then checks if `n` is odd or even.
4. If `n` is odd:
   - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price `b` is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price `2 * a`.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt separately is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as the cost for `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b` plus the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price `a`.
5. If `n` is even:
   - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price `b` is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price `2 * a`.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt separately is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as the cost for `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b`.

This logic correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and compares the costs of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs under promotion to determine the minimum cost.

The provided program correctly implements the above logic. Therefore, it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
