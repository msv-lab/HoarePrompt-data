The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. It determines whether Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins, and for each test case, it outputs "YES" along with the number of transactions and the details of each transaction if possible, or "NO" if it is not possible to buy exactly `k` jewels.
