t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive. a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
