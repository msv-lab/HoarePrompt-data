Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Problem Recap
A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(1 \le i < j \le n\)) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and processes each test case as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\).
2. It initializes a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where:
   - \(r_x = -num \% x\)
   - \(r_y = num \% y\)
3. For each number in the array, it calculates `r_x` and `r_y` and checks how many times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before. It adds this count to the total count of beautiful pairs.
4. It updates the `residue_map` with the current number's residues.

### Correctness of the Approach

To determine if the program is correct, let's verify the logic:

#### Condition Analysis
1. **Condition 1**: \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
   - This implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\), or equivalently, \(a_i \% x \equiv -a_j \% x \pmod{x}\).
   - The program calculates `r_x = -num % x` for each number, which is equivalent to finding the residue of \(-num\) modulo \(x\).

2. **Condition 2**: \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)
   - This implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).
   - The program calculates `r_y = num % y` for each number.

#### Logic Verification
- The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of pairs `(r_x, r_y)`.
- For each number in the array, it checks how many times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before and adds this count to the total count of beautiful pairs.
- It then updates the dictionary with the current number's residues.

### Annotations and Code Flow
- **State Before Function Call**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array `arr`.
- **State After Processing Each Test Case**:
  - `residue_map` keeps track of the residues `(r_x, r_y)`.
  - `count` accumulates the number of beautiful pairs.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the first example:
- Input: `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `arr = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
- Beautiful pairs:
  - \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\): \(1 + 9 = 10\) (divisible by 5) and \(1 - 9 = -8\) (divisible by 2).
  - \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\): \(4 + 6 = 10\) (divisible by 5) and \(4 - 6 = -2\) (divisible by 2).

The program should correctly identify these pairs.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging modular arithmetic and efficiently counts these pairs using a dictionary. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
