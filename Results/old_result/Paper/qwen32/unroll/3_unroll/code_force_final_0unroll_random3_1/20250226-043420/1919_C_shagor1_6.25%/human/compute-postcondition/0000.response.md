In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer `t`, which is obtained from the input. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `n` and `a` are defined inside the loop body, so they do not affect the loop's execution from the perspective of the loop head. Therefore, we need to focus on the variable `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer read from the input.
2. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(0)` would result in no iterations.
3. The variable `t` is already defined in the problem statement as an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, which means it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once.

Given this, no adjustments are needed for the variable `t` itself because it is guaranteed to be within the valid range for the loop to execute. The state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
