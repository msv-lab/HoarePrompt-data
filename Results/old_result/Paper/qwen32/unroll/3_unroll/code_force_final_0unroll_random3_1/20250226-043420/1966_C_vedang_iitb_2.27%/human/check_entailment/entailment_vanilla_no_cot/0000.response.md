Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` does not properly simulate the game or determine the winning strategy.

Here's a brief analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to try to create a new list `a_new` based on the differences between the unique sorted elements of the input list `a`. However, this transformation does not have any clear relation to the game rules or the winning strategy.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine the winner recursively. The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` are not correctly handled according to the game rules. For example, when `n == 2`, the winner depends on the parity of the difference between the two piles, not just the parity of one of them. The recursive case also does not correctly simulate the game moves and the resulting game state.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. The game described is a variant of Nim, and the winner can be determined by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

Here's a correct implementation based on this approach:

```python
def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, piles in test_cases:
        xor_sum = 0
        for stones in piles:
            xor_sum ^= stones
        if xor_sum == 0:
            results.append("Bob")
        else:
            results.append("Alice")
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]),
    (2, [1, 7]),
    (7, [1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]),
    (3, [1, 2, 3]),
    (6, [2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4]),
    (8, [5, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 3, 2]),
    (1, [1000000000])
]

results = determine_winner(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This implementation correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the XOR-sum of the pile sizes.
