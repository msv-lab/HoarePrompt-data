To determine the output state of the given loop, we need to analyze the code and understand how it modifies the `answer` list for each test case.

Here's the provided Python code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    array = list(range(1, n + 1))
    answer = [1]
    a = [1, -1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if (-1) ** i == -1:
            answer.append(array[a[-1]])
            a[-1] -= 1
        else:
            answer.append(array[a[0]])
            a[0] += 1
    print(*answer)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `array` is initialized to `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - `answer` is initialized to `[1]`.
   - `a` is initialized to `[1, -1]`.

2. **Loop through `i` from 1 to `n-1`**:
   - If `i` is odd (`(-1) ** i == -1`), the code appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
   - If `i` is even, the code appends `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

### Behavior:

- For each test case, the loop constructs the `answer` list by alternating between taking elements from the start and end of the `array`.
- When `i` is odd, it takes the element from the current end of `array` (pointed by `a[-1]`) and decrements `a[-1]`.
- When `i` is even, it takes the element from the current start of `array` (pointed by `a[0]`) and increments `a[0]`.

### Example:

Let's consider a test case with `n = 6`:

- Initial `array`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
- Initial `answer`: `[1]`
- Initial `a`: `[1, -1]`

Iteration by iteration:
- `i = 1` (odd): `answer` becomes `[1, 6]`, `a` becomes `[1, -2]`
- `i = 2` (even): `answer` becomes `[1, 6, 2]`, `a` becomes `[2, -2]`
- `i = 3` (odd): `answer` becomes `[1, 6, 2, 5]`, `a` becomes `[2, -3]`
- `i = 4` (even): `answer` becomes `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3]`, `a` becomes `[3, -3]`
- `i = 5` (odd): `answer` becomes `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`, `a` becomes `[3, -4]`

The final `answer` for `n = 6` is `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.

### General Output State:

For any given `n`, the `answer` list will be constructed by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the initial array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

### Output State:

Output State: **For each test case with given `n` and `k`, the `answer` list will be constructed by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the initial array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` will remain unchanged except for `answer` being updated for each test case.**
