You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: a series of w integers, each representing the number of shapes that can be formed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers, and for each test case, it calculates and prints the number of shapes that can be formed, where each shape requires at least three identical integers.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the requirement that a polygon must have at least 3 sides. The code currently counts any group of 3 or more sticks of the same length as forming a polygon, which is correct, but it does not ensure that the maximum number of polygons is formed. Specifically, the code does not handle cases where forming smaller polygons with fewer sticks could allow for more polygons to be formed overall.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The correct output should be `2` because you can form two equilateral triangles (polygons with 3 sides) using all six sticks. However, the provided code will output `1` because it divides the count of sticks of length 2 by 3, resulting in `2 // 3 = 0` and then adds 1 because `2 % 3 != 0`, but this is not the optimal solution.

Another example:
```
1
8
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```
The correct output should be `2` because you can form two equilateral triangles (polygons with 3 sides) using all eight sticks. The provided code will output `2` in this case, but it does not guarantee this for all cases.

The code needs to be modified to ensure that it always forms the maximum number of polygons by considering all possible polygon sizes (3 sides and above) and choosing the optimal combination. The current implementation does not handle this optimally.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses this issue:
```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) is None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for j in d:
            count = d[j]
            # Try to form polygons with the maximum number of sides first
            for sides in range(3, count + 1):
                polygons = count // sides
                if polygons > 0:
                    shapes += polygons
                    count -= polygons * sides
                    break
        print(shapes)

func()
```
This corrected code ensures that it always forms the maximum number of polygons by considering all possible polygon sizes and choosing the optimal combination.
