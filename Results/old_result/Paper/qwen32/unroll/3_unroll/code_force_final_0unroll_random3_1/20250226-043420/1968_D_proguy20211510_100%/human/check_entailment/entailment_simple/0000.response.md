### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by simulating the game for both players, Bodya and Sasha, and determining the winner based on their scores after `k` turns. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the permutation), `k` (number of turns), `pb` (Bodya's starting position), and `ps` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Tracking Paths:**
   - The program uses two lists, `pathb` and `paths`, to store the sequence of scores Bodya and Sasha collect as they move according to the permutation.
   - It also uses a `vis` list (visited) to avoid infinite loops by marking positions that have already been visited.

3. **Simulating Moves:**
   - For Bodya, it starts from `pb`, collects the score from `a[pb-1]`, and moves to `p[pb-1]`, repeating this process until a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited).
   - The same process is repeated for Sasha starting from `ps`.

4. **Calculating Scores:**
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve after `k` turns by considering all possible stopping points in their path.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the path, updating the cumulative score and the maximum score that can be achieved by stopping at each position.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the program compares them and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on who has the higher score.

### Correctness:

The program correctly simulates the game by following the rules and correctly calculates the maximum scores for both players. It handles the input constraints efficiently and provides the correct output for the given examples.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
