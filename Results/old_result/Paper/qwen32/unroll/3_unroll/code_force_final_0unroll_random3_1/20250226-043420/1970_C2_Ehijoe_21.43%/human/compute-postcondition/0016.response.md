Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `nodes`, which is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of the node. It also accepts a parameter `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree. The function returns a list of integers representing the nodes in the order they are visited in a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the `start` node.**
