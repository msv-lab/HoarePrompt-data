You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), which is the length of the array a.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The output state will consist of `n_cases` lines, each containing the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the `n` value provided for that test case. The variables `n_cases` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `n` changes with each iteration as it is read from the input for each test case. The variable `power` is a temporary variable used within each iteration and does not persist after the loop.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`. For each test case, it outputs the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the specified swap operations for every test case. Let's analyze why the code is incorrect.

### Issues in the code:
1. **Incorrect calculation of the largest divisor**: The code calculates `power` based on the logarithm of `n`, which is not the correct approach to find the largest divisor of `n` other than `n` itself. The largest divisor of `n` other than `n` itself can be found by iterating from `n//2` down to `1` and checking if the number is a divisor.
2. **Incorrect handling of the power of 2**: The code incorrectly uses `power` to calculate the position of 1, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The position of 1 after all the swaps is related to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, but the code does not correctly compute this.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. This is because the position of 1 in the array after all the swaps is `2^k` where `k` is the largest integer such that `2^k <= n`.

### Correct Code:
```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 0
            while (1 << power) <= n:
                power += 1
            print(1 << (power - 1))

func()
```

### Explanation of Correct Code:
- For each test case, if `n` is 1, the position of 1 remains 1.
- For `n > 1`, we find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` by using bitwise left shift (`1 << power`).
- The position of 1 in the resulting array is `2^k` where `k` is the largest integer such that `2^k <= n`.

### Example:
For `n = 120240229`, the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `120240229` is `2^26 = 67108864`. Hence, the position of 1 in the resulting array is `67108864`, which matches the expected output.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
