The code snippet reads a single line of input which contains two integers, `n` and `m`, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state includes multiple test cases, but the code provided only processes one line of input at a time. Therefore, the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input, but the number of test cases `t` remains unchanged and is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100), where `n` is the number of moves Nikita can make and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the current test case input.**
