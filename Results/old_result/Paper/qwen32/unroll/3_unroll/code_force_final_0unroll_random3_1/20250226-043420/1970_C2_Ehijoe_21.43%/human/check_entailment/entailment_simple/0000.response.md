### Reasoning:

The problem involves a game played on a tree where players take turns moving a stone from one node to an adjacent node until no valid moves remain. The player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine who wins the game given the starting node of the stone and the structure of the tree.

The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Building the Tree:**
   - The tree is built using a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.
   - The tree is constructed by reading the edges from the input.

2. **Finding the Distances:**
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the distances from a starting node to all leaf nodes.
   - If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor and it's the parent), it returns `[0]`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances for all children (neighbors that are not the parent) and adds 1 to each distance.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The starting node for the stone is read from the input.
   - `func_1` is called to get the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
   - If any of these distances are odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins. This is because if there is at least one odd-length path from the starting node to a leaf, Ron can force a win by ensuring that he always leaves Hermione with an even-length path.

### Analysis:

- **Tree Structure Handling:** The tree is correctly built using adjacency lists.
- **Distance Calculation:** `func_1` correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes, which is crucial for determining the winner.
- **Winning Condition:** The code correctly checks if there is any odd distance in the list of distances. If there is, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given tree structure and starting node. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:

Reasoning: The program correctly builds the tree, calculates distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes, and determines the winner based on whether any of these distances are odd.
Correctness: **True**
