Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether a given `k` maximizes the profit. The function `func_1` seems to be checking whether the total revenue from selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`, which is not the correct condition to maximize profit.

The goal is to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit, which is the total revenue from selling the buns. The correct approach would be to calculate the total revenue for different values of `k` and choose the one that gives the maximum revenue. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def calculate_profit(k, a, b, n):
    # Calculate the profit for a given k
    profit = (b + b - k + 1) * k // 2 + a * (n - k)
    return profit

def find_max_profit(n, a, b):
    # Binary search to find the maximum profit
    low = 0
    high = min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = calculate_profit(mid, a, b, n)
        profit_next = calculate_profit(mid + 1, a, b, n)
        if profit_mid < profit_next:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
    return max_profit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(find_max_profit(n, a, b))
```

In this corrected version, `calculate_profit` computes the profit for a given `k`, and `find_max_profit` uses binary search to find the `k` that maximizes the profit.

Correctness: **False**
