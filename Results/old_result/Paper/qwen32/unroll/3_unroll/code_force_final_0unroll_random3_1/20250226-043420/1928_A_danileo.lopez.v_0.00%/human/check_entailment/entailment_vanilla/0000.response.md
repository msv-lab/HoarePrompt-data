### Reasoning:
To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut, we need to analyze the conditions under which this is possible.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - Bob can make a cut parallel to either the length (a) or the width (b) of the rectangle.
   - If Bob cuts parallel to the length (a), he will get two rectangles of size (a/2) x b (if a is even) or two rectangles of size (a-1)/2 x b and 1 x b (if a is odd).
   - If Bob cuts parallel to the width (b), he will get two rectangles of size a x (b/2) (if b is even) or two rectangles of size a x (b-1)/2 and a x 1 (if b is odd).

2. **Forming Another Rectangle:**
   - From the two resulting rectangles, Bob can form another rectangle if the total area of the two rectangles can be rearranged into a new rectangle with different dimensions.
   - If either a or b is even, Bob can always form another rectangle because he can cut the rectangle into two equal parts along the even dimension, and these parts can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - If both a and b are odd, Bob will get two rectangles of different sizes (e.g., (a-1)/2 x b and 1 x b or a x (b-1)/2 and a x 1), and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions (since the only possible rearrangement would be back to the original dimensions).

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly checks if either dimension (a or b) is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes" because Bob can form another rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, it prints "No" because Bob cannot form another rectangle.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic described above.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
