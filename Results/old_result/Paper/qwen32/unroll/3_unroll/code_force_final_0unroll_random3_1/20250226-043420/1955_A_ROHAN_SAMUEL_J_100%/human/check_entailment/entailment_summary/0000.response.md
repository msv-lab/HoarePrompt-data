Reasoning:
The program correctly handles the logic for determining the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b`.

1. The program iterates through `t` test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It then checks if `n` is odd or even.
4. If `n` is odd, the program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`). If true, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price). Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price, and one yogurt at the regular price).
5. If `n` is even, the program performs a similar check. If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price is less than the promotion price, it calculates the cost as `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price).

The logic correctly considers both the odd and even cases and makes the optimal choice based on the given prices. The execution summary aligns with this reasoning and the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
