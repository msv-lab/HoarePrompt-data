To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set in a way that allows the loop to execute.

Given that `t` is already described as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute at least once (since `t` is positive). The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it is initialized by the `range` function.

The variables `n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and the `results` list are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing. However, they are part of the context in which the loop will operate.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute, given the constraints on `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list**
