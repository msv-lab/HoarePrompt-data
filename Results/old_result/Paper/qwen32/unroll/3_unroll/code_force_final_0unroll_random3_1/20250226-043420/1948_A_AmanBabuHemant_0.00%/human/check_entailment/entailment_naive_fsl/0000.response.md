Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a string of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem description. Instead, it generates a string consisting of the digits '1' and '0'. Additionally, the program incorrectly determines the feasibility of constructing such a string based on whether `n` is even, which is not the correct condition.

The problem requires that there be exactly `n` special characters in the string, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters that satisfies this condition.

For example, for `n = 1`, the program incorrectly outputs "NO", but the correct output would be "YES" followed by a string like "AA" or "BB", where the middle character is special.

For `n = 2`, the program also incorrectly outputs "NO", but a correct output would be "YES" followed by a string like "AAB" or "BBA", where the middle two characters are special.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. If `n` is 1, the output should be "YES" followed by a string like "AA" or "BB".
2. If `n` is greater than 1, the output should be "YES" followed by a string where there are `n` special characters. One way to achieve this is to create a pattern where each special character is a part of a pair of the same character, except for one character that is part of a triplet. For example, for `n = 6`, the string "AAABAACC" works because there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AA')
        elif n == 2:
            print('YES')
            print('AAB')
        else:
            s = 'AA' * (n - 1) + 'AAA'
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

This corrected program generates strings of uppercase Latin letters and correctly handles the cases where `n` is 1 or greater than 1.
