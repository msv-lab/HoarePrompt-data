You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that no two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero, which is a key requirement of the problem.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Binary Representation and Adjustment**:
   - The program first converts the number `x` into its binary representation and stores it in the list `s`.
   - It then attempts to adjust this binary representation to meet the problem's constraints by replacing consecutive '1's with '-1' and '0' pairs.

2. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
   - The code tries to handle consecutive '1's by replacing the first '1' with '-1' and the next '0' with '1'. However, this approach does not guarantee that no two consecutive elements will be non-zero after all adjustments.
   - For example, consider the input `x = 7` (binary `111`). The initial binary representation would be `['1', '1', '1']`. After the first iteration of the loop, it might become `['-1', '0', '1']`, but the second iteration might not correctly handle the remaining consecutive '1's, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Appending '1' to the List**:
   - The code appends '1' to the list if the last element is '0' and `flag` is set, but this does not guarantee that the constraints are met for all cases.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the binary representation is all '1's or has a specific pattern that requires careful adjustment to meet the problem's constraints.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input**:
```
1
7
```

**Expected Output**:
```
3
-1 0 1
```
or any other valid array such as:
```
3
1 0 -1
```

**Actual Output** (based on the provided code):
The code might produce an incorrect array like `['-1', '0', '1']` without further adjustments to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not guarantee that the constraints of the problem are met for all possible inputs.
