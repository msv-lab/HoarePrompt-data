Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` as described in the problem. The program attempts to account for duplicates and missing values in the set `S` but does not correctly simulate the process of selecting indices and inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S` while maintaining the lexicographical order.

The core issue lies in the fact that the program does not simulate the process of selecting indices in a way that maximizes the resulting array `b`. It simply adds `i + 1` to each element and then sorts the unique elements in descending order. This does not guarantee the lexicographically largest `b` because it doesn't consider the optimal sequence of index selections.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to simulate the process of selecting indices and inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S` in a way that maximizes the resulting array `b`. One possible approach is to always select the largest possible `a_i + i` at each step, which can be achieved by sorting the array in a specific order and then processing it accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedSet

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Create a list of tuples (a_i + i, i) and sort it in descending order of a_i + i
    elements = [(a[i] + i, i) for i in range(n)]
    elements.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    # Use a SortedSet to maintain the unique elements in S
    S = SortedSet()
    
    # Process each element in the sorted order
    for value, index in elements:
        if value not in S:
            S.add(value)
    
    # Convert the SortedSet to a list and sort it in descending order
    b = list(S)
    b.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Print the resulting array b
    print(*b)
```

This corrected program uses a `SortedSet` to maintain the unique elements in `S` and processes the elements in the order that maximizes the resulting array `b`.
