Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all valid input cases. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a time string, splits it into hours and minutes, and then uses a series of `if-elif` statements to determine the correct hour in 12-hour format and whether it is AM or PM. The program prints the converted time in the required format, keeping the minutes unchanged and adjusting the hour and AM/PM designation appropriately.

The program accounts for all edge cases, such as:
- Midnight (00:00) which should be converted to 12:00 AM.
- Noon (12:00) which should be converted to 12:00 PM.
- Hours from 01:00 to 11:59 which should remain unchanged except for the AM designation.
- Hours from 13:00 to 23:59 which should have the hour adjusted by subtracting 12 and the PM designation.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
