You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it determines if there exists at least one position where the character in `c` does not match the character in either `a` or `b`, and prints 'YES' if such a position exists, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:

The given program has a logical flaw. Let's analyze the code and the problem description to understand why it is incorrect.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a template `t` such that:
  - Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - String `c` does not match the template `t`.
- For each position `i` in the strings:
  - If `t[i]` is lowercase, then `a[i] == t[i]` and `b[i] == t[i]`.
  - If `t[i]` is uppercase, then `a[i] != t[i]` and `b[i] != t[i]`.
- The string `c` must not match the template `t` at any position.

### Analysis of the Code:
The code iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It checks the following conditions:
1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, it checks if `c[i] != a[i]`. If true, it sets `possible = True` and breaks the loop.
2. If `a[i] != b[i]`, it checks if `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]`. If neither is true, it sets `possible = True` and breaks the loop.

### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not correctly handle the case where `a[i] == b[i]`. The template `t` should have `t[i]` as an uppercase letter in this case to ensure that `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- The code does not ensure that `t[i]` is lowercase when `a[i] == b[i] == c[i]`, which would make `c` match the template.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2
aa
aa
aa
```
- For this input, the correct template should be `AA` because `a` and `b` match the template, and `c` does not.
- However, the code will set `possible = True` because `a[0] == b[0]` and `c[0] != a[0]` is false, but `a[1] == b[1]` and `c[1] != a[1]` is also false. The code does not correctly handle this scenario.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through each character and:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, the template should have an uppercase letter at position `i` to ensure `c[i]` is different.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, the template should have a lowercase letter at position `i` to ensure both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template, and `c[i]` does not match if it is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
