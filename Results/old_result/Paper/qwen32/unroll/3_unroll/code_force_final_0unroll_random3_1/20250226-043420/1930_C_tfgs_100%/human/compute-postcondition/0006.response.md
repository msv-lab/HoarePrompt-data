The code snippet `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` into a set to remove any duplicate elements and then converts it back into a list. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `counter`, or `cur`. The only change is that `a` will no longer contain any duplicate elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` is the sum of the original `a_i` and `i + 1`, satisfying 2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 + n; `counter` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the original `a`; `cur` is 0.**
