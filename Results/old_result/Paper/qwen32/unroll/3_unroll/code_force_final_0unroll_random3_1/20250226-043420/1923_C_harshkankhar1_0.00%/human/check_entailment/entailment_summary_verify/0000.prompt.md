You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each test case, it calculates cumulative sums of the list and answers queries about sublists, printing "YES" or "NO" based on specific conditions. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with constraints on the total number of elements and queries across all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization and Accumulation**:
   - The program initializes `a` with a prefix sum including an extra `0` at the start, which is fine for prefix sum calculations.
   - The program initializes `b` with `0`s and then sets each `b[i]` to `b[i-1] + x`, where `x` is `1` if `a[i] > 1` else `2`. This seems to be an attempt to create a `b` array with the required properties, but it doesn't guarantee that `a_i != b_i` for every index `i`.

2. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - The program checks if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y` to determine if the subarray is "good". However, this logic is flawed.
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b`. This is not sufficient to ensure that `a_i != b_i` for every index `i`.
   - The condition `x == y` is incorrect because even if `x == y`, the subarray can still be "good" if `a[x] != b[x]`.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     3 1
     2 2 2
     1 3
     ```
     - Here, `n = 3`, `q = 1`, and the array `c = [2, 2, 2]`.
     - The subarray `c[1:3]` is `[2, 2, 2]`.
     - The program will set `b` as `[0, 1, 2, 3]` because each element in `a` is greater than `1`.
     - The prefix sums for `a` will be `[0, 2, 4, 6]`.
     - For the query `1 3`, `a[3] - a[0] = 6` and `b[3] - b[0] = 3`.
     - The condition `a[3] - a[0] < b[3] - b[0]` is `6 < 3`, which is false.
     - The condition `x == y` is false because `1 != 3`.
     - Therefore, the program will print `YES`, but the subarray `[2, 2, 2]` cannot be "good" because there is no array `b` such that `a_i != b_i` for every index `i` and `b_i > 0`.

Given this counterexample, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
