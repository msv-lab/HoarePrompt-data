In the provided for loop, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 automatically by the `range(t)` function, so we don't need to adjust its initial state. The only variable we need to ensure is properly set is `t` to make sure the loop can execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), we need to ensure `t` is within this range for the loop to execute correctly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
