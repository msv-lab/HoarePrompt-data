Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `lex` between 1 and 78. For each test case, it outputs a sequence of three lowercase letters derived from the value of `lex`. The letters are determined by converting parts of `lex` into their corresponding positions in the alphabet.**
