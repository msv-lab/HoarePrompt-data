The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within the ranges 1 to 26. After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values provided by the input, and `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and `n` and `k` have been updated to the values provided by the input.**
