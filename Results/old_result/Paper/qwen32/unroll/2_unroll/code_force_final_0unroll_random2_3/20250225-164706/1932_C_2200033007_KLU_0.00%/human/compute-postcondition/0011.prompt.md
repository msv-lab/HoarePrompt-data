You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `b` is a permutation of `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is equal to `n` or more, and `r` is less than 0 or equal to -1, indicating that all elements of `a` have been processed.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` is a permutation of `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is equal to `n` or more, and `r` is less than 0 or equal to -1, indicating that all elements of `a` have been processed; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order; `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list 'ans' which contains the cumulative products of the elements in 'b' in their original order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It also accepts a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The function returns a list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements in another list `b` in their original order. The list `b` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, so it is assumed to be derived from the inputs `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` in a manner not specified here. The reversed list `ans` is then returned.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the reversed list 'ans' which contains the cumulative products of the elements in 'b' in their original order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
