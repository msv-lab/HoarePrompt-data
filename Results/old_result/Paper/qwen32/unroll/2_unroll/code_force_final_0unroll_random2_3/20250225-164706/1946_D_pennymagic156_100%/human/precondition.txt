The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and x (0 ≤ x < 2^30), where n is the length of the array a and x is the favorite number. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30), representing the array a. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
