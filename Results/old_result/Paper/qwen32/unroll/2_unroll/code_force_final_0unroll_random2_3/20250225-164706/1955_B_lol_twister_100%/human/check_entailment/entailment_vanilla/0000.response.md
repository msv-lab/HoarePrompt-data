Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
- **Progressive Square Construction**: The progressive square is constructed based on the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)c + (j-1)d \).
- **Given Values**: The initial value \( a_{1,1} \) is not directly given but is instead determined as the minimum value in the array since the problem states that the progressive square can be uniquely determined.
- **Verification**: For each test case, the program needs to check if the given array can be rearranged to form the progressive square as per the above formula.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read first.
   - For each test case, the values of \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \) are read.
   - The array \( l \) containing \( n^2 \) integers is read.

2. **Progressive Square Generation**:
   - The minimum value in the array \( l \) is considered as \( a_{1,1} \).
   - The program then constructs the progressive square by iterating over each cell \( (i, j) \) and calculating the value using the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)c + (j-1)d \).
   - These values are stored in a list \( li \).

3. **Verification**:
   - Both the generated list \( li \) and the input list \( l \) are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are, it means the array can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the initial value \( a_{1,1} \) as the minimum value in the array.
- It accurately constructs the progressive square using the provided formula.
- It correctly compares the sorted versions of the generated list and the input list to verify if the array can form the progressive square.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct as it properly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
