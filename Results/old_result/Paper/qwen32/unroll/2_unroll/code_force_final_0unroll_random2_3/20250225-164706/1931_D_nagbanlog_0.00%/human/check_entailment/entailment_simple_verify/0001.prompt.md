You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

**Problem Recap:**
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` of length `n`. A pair of indices `<i, j>` is beautiful if:
1. `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.

**Key Observations:**
1. For `a[i] + a[j]` to be divisible by `x`, `(a[i] % x) + (a[j] % x)` should be divisible by `x`.
2. For `a[i] - a[j]` to be divisible by `y`, `(a[i] % y) - (a[j] % y)` should be divisible by `y`.

**Program Analysis:**
The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(a[i] % x, a[i] % y)`.

For each number in the array `a`, the program calculates:
- `mod_x = num % x`
- `mod_y = num % y`
- `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` (This is the value that `a[j] % x` should have to satisfy the first condition with `a[i]`)
- `required_mod_y = mod_y` (This is the value that `a[j] % y` should have to satisfy the second condition with `a[i]`)

If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is already in `freq`, it means there are numbers in the array that, when paired with the current number, form a beautiful pair. The count of such numbers is added to `beautiful_count`.

The program then updates the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

**Potential Issues:**
The program seems to be correctly implementing the logic based on the observations above. However, there is a subtle issue with the logic for `required_mod_y`. The condition `a[i] - a[j]` being divisible by `y` is equivalent to `a[i] % y` being equal to `a[j] % y`, not `(x - mod_x) % x`. Therefore, `required_mod_y` should be `mod_y`, not `(x - mod_x) % x`.

**Corrected Logic:**
- `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` (This is correct for the first condition)
- `required_mod_y = mod_y` (This is correct for the second condition)

However, the program is actually correct in terms of logic because `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y`, which is the correct value to check for the second condition.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. There are no logical errors in the provided program.

Correctness: **True**
