Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`, where `a` is an empty list and `ans` holds the maximum count of elements that can be XORed to zero at any bit position.**

Since `a` is an empty list, `len(a)` is 0. Therefore, the program will return the value of `ans` if it is greater than 0, otherwise, it will return 0.
