Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the rounds of the game and determine how many players are left after all rounds have been played. However, the current implementation of `func_1` simply returns either `a - 1` or `b` based on a comparison between `a` and `b`, which does not reflect the game's rules.

The correct implementation of `func_1` should simulate the process of removing players as described in the problem. Specifically, in each round, the function should:
1. Identify the players to be removed based on the positions in the list `a`.
2. Remove those players from the line.
3. Repeat the process until no players are removed in a round.
4. Return the number of players remaining.

The provided function does not perform these steps and instead returns a value that is not related to the number of winners in the game.

Correctness: **False**
