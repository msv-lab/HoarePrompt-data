Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Let's analyze the issues in the code.

1. **Function Name and Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is called within the loop but is not defined in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError`.
   
2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `n == k` by printing "YES" with one stall priced at 1. This is correct.
   - The code also handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO". This is correct.
   
3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The logic for the general case is flawed. The code initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall and subtracting the cost from `n`.
   - The code then checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`. If it is, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the given costs.
   - The costs are hardcoded as `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which is not a reliable strategy to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. There are many possible combinations of stall prices and numbers of stalls that could achieve this, and the current approach does not guarantee the correct solution.

4. **Example Failure**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 255`, `k = 8`. The correct output should be "YES" with 8 stalls priced as `128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`.
   - However, the provided code will not produce this result. The hardcoded costs `[n - k + 1, 1]` will not lead to Alice buying exactly 8 jewels in this case.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases and thus the correctness is **False**.
