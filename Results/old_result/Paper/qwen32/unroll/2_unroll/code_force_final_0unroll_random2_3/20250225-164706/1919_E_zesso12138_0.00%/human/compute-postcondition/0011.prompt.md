You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array a.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the size of the last processed array `p`; `p` is the last processed list of integers; `input` holds the entire input provided as a string; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace; `index` is the position in `data` after processing all `t` arrays; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` for the corresponding `n` and `p`.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: n is the size of the last processed array p; p is the last processed list of integers; input holds the entire input provided as a string; data is a list of strings obtained by splitting input on whitespace; index is the position in data after processing all t arrays; t is the integer value of data[0]; results is a list of t elements, each being the result of func_1 for the corresponding n and p. The contents of results have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p`, a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`. The function returns the hidden array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
