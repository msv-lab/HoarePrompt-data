### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the program and the logic it uses to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so the maximum profit is simply selling all buns at the usual price `a`. Therefore, the profit is `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, it means the modified price can be beneficial. The program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a` because selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would not be beneficial since the price would drop below `a`.
   - The profit from selling `k` buns at the modified price is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`. This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary confirms that the function processes each test case correctly based on the logic described above.
   - It correctly handles the case where `b <= a` by printing `a * n`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `b > a` by calculating the profit using the derived formula.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
