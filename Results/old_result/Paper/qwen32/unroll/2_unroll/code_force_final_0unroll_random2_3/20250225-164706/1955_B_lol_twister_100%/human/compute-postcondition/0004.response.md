The code snippet `li.sort()` sorts the list `li` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `a` (the minimum value in the list `l`) also remains unchanged, but the list `li` is now ordered.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 25 * 10^4. `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`. `li` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is of the form a + k * c + d * h for k, h in the range [0, n-1], and `li` is sorted in ascending order.**
