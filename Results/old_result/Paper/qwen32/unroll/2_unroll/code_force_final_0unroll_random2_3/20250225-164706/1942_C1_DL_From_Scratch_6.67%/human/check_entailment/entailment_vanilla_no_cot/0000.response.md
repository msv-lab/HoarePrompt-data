Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The logic seems to be based on counting gaps between chosen vertices and adding triangles based on those gaps, but it does not properly account for the formation of triangles within the polygon.

Here are some issues with the provided program:

1. **Triangle Formation**: The program does not correctly account for the formation of triangles. It only checks for gaps between vertices and adds 1 to the count if the gap is exactly 1, which is not sufficient to determine the number of triangles that can be formed.

2. **Circular Nature of the Polygon**: The program does not handle the circular nature of the polygon correctly. It only checks the gap between the last and first vertex but does not connect it properly with the logic for counting triangles.

3. **General Approach**: The program's approach is not general enough to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed. It needs to consider all possible sets of three vertices that can form a triangle and ensure that the diagonals do not intersect.

To solve this problem, a more appropriate approach would involve using dynamic programming or combinatorial geometry to count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with the given vertices.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect for the problem as described.
