Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the logic for calculating the sum after Alice's and Bob's moves is flawed. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Handling of Alice's Moves**: The program assumes that Alice will remove the largest elements first, which is not always optimal. Alice should aim to maximize the sum after her removals, considering Bob's subsequent moves.

2. **Handling of Bob's Moves**: The program incorrectly calculates the sum after Bob's moves. After Alice removes elements, Bob should aim to minimize the sum by flipping the sign of the smallest elements. The current logic does not correctly account for this.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when Alice can remove all elements or when Bob can flip all remaining elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes k elements to maximize the sum
        if k >= n:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Remove k elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips x elements to minimize the sum
        # We need to flip the smallest x elements
        if x >= len(a):
            print(-sum(a))
            continue
        
        # Flip the smallest x elements
        for i in range(x):
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        print(sum(a))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice removes the k smallest elements to maximize the remaining sum, and then Bob flips the x smallest remaining elements to minimize the sum.
