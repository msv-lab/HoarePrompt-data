Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Percentage Calculation Error**: The program calculates the percentage of 0s and 1s incorrectly. Instead of checking if the number of 0s (or 1s) is at least the ceiling of half the number of houses on that side, it calculates percentages and checks if they are at least 50. This is incorrect.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the cases where the road could be placed before the first house or after the last house correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining if placing the road at position 0 or n is valid is flawed.

3. **Optimization**: The program unnecessarily sorts the list of valid positions. Since it already finds the minimum distance, it can directly find and print the smallest valid position without sorting.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        pk = (n + 1) // 2  # This is the middle position for comparison
        zero, one = 0, 0
        best_i = -1
        min_dist = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            # Check if the left side condition is satisfied
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2):
                # Check if the right side condition is satisfied
                if one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                    current_dist = abs(pk - (i + 1))
                    if current_dist < min_dist or (current_dist == min_dist and i + 1 < best_i):
                        min_dist = current_dist
                        best_i = i + 1
        
        # Check if placing the road before the first house is valid
        if one >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            if min_dist > pk or (min_dist == pk and best_i > 0):
                best_i = 0
        
        # Check if placing the road after the last house is valid
        if zero >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            if min_dist > abs(pk - n) or (min_dist == abs(pk - n) and best_i > n):
                best_i = n
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the conditions for placing the road and handles the edge cases correctly.
