In the provided for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute based on the value provided by the input. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, and the number of iterations is determined by the integer value returned by `int(input())`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input value (which determines the number of iterations) is at least 1. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and the loop will iterate `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

The state of `n` and `a` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, as they are used within the loop body, not in the loop head. Therefore, we do not need to adjust them to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
