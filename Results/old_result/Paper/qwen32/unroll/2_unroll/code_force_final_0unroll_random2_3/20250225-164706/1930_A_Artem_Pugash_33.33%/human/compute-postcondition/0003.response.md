Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided integers.**
