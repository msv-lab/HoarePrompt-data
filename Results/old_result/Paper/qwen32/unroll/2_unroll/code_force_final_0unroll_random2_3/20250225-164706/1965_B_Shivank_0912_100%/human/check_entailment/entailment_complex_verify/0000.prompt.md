You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        
        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: t is 0, n and k are the values from the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a list of integers based on the value of `k` and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list is constructed such that it includes specific values derived from `k` and powers of 2, excluding the power of 2 that is closest to `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to ensure it meets the problem description. The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers with the following properties:

1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

The provided program constructs such a sequence as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)
```

### Analysis

1. **Finding the largest power of 2 less than `k`**:
   - The variable `i` is used to find the largest power of 2 less than `k`. This is done by the loop `while 1 << i + 1 <= k: i = i + 1`.

2. **Constructing the sequence**:
   - The initial sequence `ans` is constructed with three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
   - The rest of the sequence is constructed by appending powers of 2 up to `2^19` except for `2^i`.

### Verification

Let's verify whether the sequence meets the problem requirements:

1. **No subsequence should sum to `k`**:
   - The element `k - (1 << i)` is less than `k` by a power of 2.
   - The elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are greater than `k`.
   - The remaining elements are powers of 2 up to `2^19` except `2^i`.

2. **Every sum from 1 to `n` (except `k`) should be achievable**:
   - The sequence includes powers of 2, which can form any sum through binary representation.
   - The element `k - (1 << i)` helps in forming sums that are less than `k` by a power of 2.
   - The elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` help in forming sums greater than `k`.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's test the provided program with the given example cases:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `2 2`
   - Output: `1 1`
   - Explanation: The sequence `[1]` can form sums `1` but not `2`.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `6 1`
   - Output: `5 2 3 4 5 6`
   - Explanation: All sums from `2` to `6` can be formed using the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `8 8`
   - Output: `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Explanation: All sums from `1` to `7` can be formed using the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `9 3`
   - Output: `4 7 1 4 1`
   - Explanation: All sums from `1` to `9` except `3` can be formed using the sequence `[7, 1, 4, 1]`.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `10 7`
   - Output: `4 1 2 8 3`
   - Explanation: All sums from `1` to `10` except `7` can be formed using the sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]`.

### Conclusion

The program seems to correctly construct a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for the provided example cases. However, to conclusively determine the correctness, we need to consider edge cases and the constraints.

### Edge Cases to Consider

1. **`k` is a power of 2**:
   - For `n = 8` and `k = 4`, the sequence should not sum to `4` and should be able to form all other sums from `1` to `8`.

2. **`k` is close to `n`**:
   - For `n = 10^6` and `k = 10^6 - 1`, the sequence should not sum to `10^6 - 1` and should be able to form all other sums from `1` to `10^6`.

Given the complexity of the problem and the constraints, the provided program appears to handle the general cases correctly. However, without a rigorous mathematical proof, we cannot be absolutely certain that it handles every edge case perfectly.

### Final Answer

Based on the analysis and testing with example cases, the program seems to meet the problem description correctly. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **True**.
