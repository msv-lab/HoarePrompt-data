You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments but reads from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: After processing all test cases, the program will have printed 'Bob' if the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have is even, and 'Alice' if the difference is odd for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the last test case processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game given the rules, we need to analyze the conditions under which Alice or Bob can force a win.

1. **Initial Conditions and Moves:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - After optionally swapping, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a move (i.e., both wallets have 0 coins).

2. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The key insight is that the game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If the difference (`abs(a - b)`) is even, Bob can always force a win.
     - This is because Bob can mirror Alice's moves. If Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. Since the difference is even, Bob can always ensure that Alice is the one left with no coins.
   - If the difference (`abs(a - b)`) is odd, Alice can always force a win.
     - Alice can adjust her moves to ensure that Bob is the one left with no coins, given the odd difference.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The provided program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between the coins is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

The program correctly implements the strategy analysis described above.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the optimal strategy derived.

Correctness: **True**
