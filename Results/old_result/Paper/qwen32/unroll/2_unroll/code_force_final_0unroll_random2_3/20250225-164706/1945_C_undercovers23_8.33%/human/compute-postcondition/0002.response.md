To determine the output state after the execution of the given loop, we need to understand what the loop does for each test case. The loop processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of a string `a` of length `n` containing '0's and '1's. The goal is to find the optimal position to split the string such that the percentage of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side is at least 50%. If no such position exists, it returns either 0 or `n` based on the overall counts of '0's and '1's in the string.

Let's break down the steps for one test case:
1. **Input Parsing**: Read `n` and the string `s`.
2. **Determine Pivot**: Calculate `pk` as `n // 2` which is the midpoint of the string.
3. **Count Characters**: Count the total number of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`) in the string.
4. **Iterate and Check**:
   - Iterate through the string up to the second last character.
   - For each position `i`, count the number of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) seen so far.
   - Calculate the percentage of '0's on the left (`zero_perc`) and '1's on the right (`one_perc`).
   - If both percentages are at least 50%, store the position `i + 1` in the list `lst`.
5. **Find Minimum Distance**:
   - Determine the position in `lst` that is closest to `pk`.
   - If no such position exists, check the overall counts of '0's and '1's to decide the output.
6. **Output**: Print the optimal position.

Given the initial state and the loop, the output state after processing all test cases will be a series of integers, each representing the optimal split position for the corresponding test case.

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the optimal split position for the corresponding test case.**
