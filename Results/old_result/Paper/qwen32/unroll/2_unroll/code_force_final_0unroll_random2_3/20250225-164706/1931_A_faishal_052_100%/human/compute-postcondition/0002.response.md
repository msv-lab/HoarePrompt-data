The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `t`, `n`, and `info` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1. The value of `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust it before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list**
