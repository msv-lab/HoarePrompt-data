Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program defines a function `func_1` which reads the integers `n` and `k` for each test case, then constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' and repeating this substring `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the resulting string `s`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The program would output `aabb`, but the correct output should be `baab` or `abab` because these strings contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using 'a' and 'b' (i.e., "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb").

The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to generate a De Bruijn sequence for the given alphabet size `k` and sequence length `n`, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring. However, the provided program does not implement this approach.

Correctness: **False**
