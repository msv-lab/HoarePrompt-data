You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting of only the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be either 'A' or 'B' depending on whether the count of 'A's or 'B's is greater in the respective string. If counts are equal, it will output 'B'. The variable `t` and the strings provided as input remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a string of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it outputs 'A' if the string contains more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it outputs 'B'. The input values `t` and the strings remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. These counters are used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, respectively.
3. **Character Counting**: For each character in the input string, it increments the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B').
4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the characters in the string, it compares the two counters. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the string consists entirely of 'A's or entirely of 'B's. It also handles the case where the counts are equal by defaulting to 'B', which is consistent with the problem statement's requirement to output one of the letters when they are equally frequent.

The logic in the program correctly implements the problem requirements. The only potential issue is the behavior when the counts are equal, but since the problem statement does not specify a preference, and the provided output for equal counts defaults to 'B', this behavior is acceptable.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
