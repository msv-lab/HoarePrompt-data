### Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of facing-up ('U') and facing-down ('D') coins. The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') at the start of the game dictates the winner.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Game Mechanics**: 
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no more facing-up coins are left.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice (the first player) can always force Bob into a losing position.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is left with the last facing-up coin and thus loses.

3. **Proof by Parity**:
   - Each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by one.
   - If the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, after an odd number of moves (which would be Alice's turn), the number of facing-up coins will be zero, meaning Alice wins.
   - If the initial number of facing-up coins is even, after an even number of moves (which would be Bob's turn), the number of facing-up coins will be zero, meaning Bob wins.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
   - If the count is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count is even, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of coins.
