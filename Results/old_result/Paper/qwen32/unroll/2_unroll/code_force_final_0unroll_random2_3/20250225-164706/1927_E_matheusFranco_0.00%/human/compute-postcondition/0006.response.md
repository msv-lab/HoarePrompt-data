To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to carefully follow how the loop modifies the `permutation` list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers with `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements as `0`.
   - `idx` is `0`.
   - `idx_v` is `1`.
   - `curr_v` is `1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs `k` times, with `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`.
   - For each `i`, the inner `while` loop increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k` starting from `i`, and assigns `curr_v` to the corresponding index in `permutation`.
   - `curr_v` is incremented after each assignment.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - For `i = 0`, the indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` (where `mk < n`) are assigned `curr_v` values starting from `1`.
   - For `i = 1`, the indices `1, k+1, 2k+1, ..., mk+1` (where `mk+1 < n`) are assigned `curr_v` values starting from the next available value.
   - This process continues for all `i` up to `k-1`.

4. **Final State**:
   - The `permutation` list will be filled with values from `1` to `n` in a specific pattern based on the multiples of `k` and the offset `i`.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
- For `i = 0`, indices `0, 4, 8` are assigned `1, 2, 3` respectively.
- For `i = 1`, indices `1, 5, 9` are assigned `4, 5, 6` respectively.
- For `i = 2`, indices `2, 6` are assigned `7, 8` respectively.
- For `i = 3`, index `3, 7` are assigned `9, 10` respectively.

Thus, the `permutation` list becomes `[1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6]`.

Output State: **permutation is [1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6], idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is 11.**
