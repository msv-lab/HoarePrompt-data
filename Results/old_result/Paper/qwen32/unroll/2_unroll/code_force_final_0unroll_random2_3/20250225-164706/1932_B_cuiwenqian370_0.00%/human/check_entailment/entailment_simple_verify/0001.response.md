Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem described. Let's analyze the code and annotations in detail to confirm this:

1. **Problem Description:**
   - The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur in sequence.

2. **Program Code and Annotations:**
   - `func_1(path)`: This function appears to be designed to process a string `path` consisting of `@` and `*` characters. It calculates some dynamic programming values based on these characters, which is unrelated to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.
   - `func_2()`: This function reads input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` with each test case. It then prints the results. However, as `func_1` is not solving the correct problem, the overall program is incorrect.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations describe the state of the program at various points, showing how `func_1` processes the `path` string. However, these annotations do not reflect the logic needed to solve the given problem.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves iterating through each sign's periodicity and calculating the year of its occurrence, ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. This is demonstrated in the correct implementation provided in the original assessment.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not address the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

Final: **False**
