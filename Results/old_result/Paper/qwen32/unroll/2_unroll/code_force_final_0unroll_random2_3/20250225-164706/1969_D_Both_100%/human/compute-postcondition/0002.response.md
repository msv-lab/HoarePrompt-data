To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all the iterations, we need to analyze the loop and its effect on the variables. Here's a breakdown of what happens in each iteration of the loop:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `heap` and `remaining_items` are reset to empty lists.
   - `n` and `k` are set by calling `func_2()`.
   - `prices` is set by calling `func_2()`.
   - `neg_prices` is derived from `prices` by negating each price.
   - `bonuses` is set by calling `func_2()`.
   - `max_profit` and `current_profit` are reset to 0.
   - `combined` is created by zipping `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and then sorted based on the bonus values.

2. **Processing**:
   - The first `k` items from `combined` are pushed into the `heap`.
   - If there are any remaining items in `combined`, `current_profit` is updated by calling `func_3(combined, heap)`.
   - If `current_profit` exceeds `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated.
   - The remaining items in `combined` are processed one by one:
     - If the sum of the price (negated) and bonus of the current item is non-negative, `current_profit` is decreased by the bonus.
     - Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the negated price.
     - The item is then pushed into the `heap`, and the smallest item in the `heap` is popped out. If the popped item is not `None`, `current_profit` is decreased by the negated price of the popped item.
     - If `current_profit` exceeds `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all items, `max_profit` is printed.

Given that the loop runs `test_cases` times, and each iteration resets and reinitializes the variables, the final state of the variables outside the loop (like `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`, and `test_cases`) will be the same as their state after the last iteration of the loop.

Since `max_profit` is the only variable that accumulates the maximum profit across all iterations, the final output state will reflect the maximum profit found across all test cases.

### Output State:
**Output State: `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `k` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `neg_prices` is the list of negated prices from the last iteration, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `max_profit` is the maximum profit found across all test cases, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, `test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`.**
