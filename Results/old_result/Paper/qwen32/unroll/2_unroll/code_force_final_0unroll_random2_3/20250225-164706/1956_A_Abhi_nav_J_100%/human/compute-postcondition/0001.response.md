The given Python code attempts to return `a - 1`, but this operation is not valid for a list in Python. Lists do not support direct arithmetic operations like subtraction with an integer. Therefore, the code would result in an error if executed as is. However, based on the task requirements and the provided format, it seems we need to interpret what the intention might be.

Given the context, if we assume the intention is to subtract 1 from each element in list `a`, the output would be a new list where each element of `a` is decreased by 1.

Let's assume this is the intended operation. Here's the calculated output state:

Output State: **a list where each element of the original list `a` is decreased by 1**
