Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not align with the problem description. The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicities of the signs. The provided code, however, appears to be related to a different problem involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, and it does not handle the input and output requirements specified in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be solving a problem related to a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the given problem. It calculates some form of score based on the path, but it does not compute the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input and processes multiple test cases, but it uses `func_1` to process each test case, which is incorrect as explained above. It also reads the input in a way that assumes each test case's path is a single string, which is not the case in the problem description. The problem description specifies that the second line of each test case contains `n` integers, not a single string.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should iterate through each test case, and for each test case, it should iterate through the signs, calculating the year each sign occurs based on the previous sign's occurrence year. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(signs):
    current_year = 0
    for period in signs:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        signs = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(signs))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected code reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on the periodicities provided.
