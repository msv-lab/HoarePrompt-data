The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input, and the precondition for `t` remains valid as it still needs to be within the range 1 to 10^4.

The variable `x` and its initial state (for each of the `t` test cases) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < 2^30.**
