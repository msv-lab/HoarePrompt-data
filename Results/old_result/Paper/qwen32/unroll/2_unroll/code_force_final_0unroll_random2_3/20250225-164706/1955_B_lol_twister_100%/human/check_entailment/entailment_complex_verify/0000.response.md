### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to ensure that the program correctly implements the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
A progressive square of size \( n \times n \) is constructed based on the values \( a_{1,1} \), \( c \), and \( d \) using the formula:
\[ a_{k+1, h+1} = a_{1,1} + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \]
for \( k, h \) in the range \([0, n-1]\). Given \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and a list of \( n^2 \) integers, the task is to determine if the list can form the progressive square.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Finding \( a_{1,1} \)**:
   - The program sets \( a \) to the minimum value in the list \( l \). This is correct because \( a_{1,1} \) is indeed the smallest element in the progressive square.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The program generates the elements using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for \( k, h \) in the range \([0, n-1]\). This is correct as per the problem description.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - The program sorts both the generated list \( li \) and the input list \( l \). It then compares the sorted lists. If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'. This approach is valid because sorting ensures that we can compare the elements in a consistent order.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly identifies the smallest element \( a \), generates the progressive square elements, sorts both lists, and compares them.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Correctness of \( a_{1,1} \)**: The assumption that \( a_{1,1} \) is the minimum value in the list is correct.
- **Correctness of the Formula**: The formula used to generate the progressive square elements is correct.
- **Sorting and Comparison**: Sorting both lists and comparing them is a valid approach.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Duplicates**: The program does not explicitly handle duplicates, but since the progressive square elements are generated uniquely based on the formula, duplicates in the input list should not be a problem as long as the formula generates the same unique elements.
- **Range of Values**: The values of \( c \) and \( d \) can be up to \(10^6\), and \( n \) can be up to 500. The generated values can be large but within the range of typical integer operations in Python.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the problem description. It identifies the smallest element as \( a_{1,1} \), generates the progressive square elements using the given formula, and checks if the input list can form the progressive square by comparing sorted lists. The annotations support this conclusion.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
