To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the variables.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is read from standard input. For each iteration:
1. It reads `n` (number of vertices) and `k` (number of edges to be removed).
2. It constructs an adjacency list `adj` representing the tree.
3. It initializes `L` to 1 and `R` to 100001.
4. It performs a binary search to find the maximum number of vertices `L` such that after removing `k` edges, at least `L` vertices are left in the largest connected component.
5. It prints the value of `L` after the binary search completes.

The variables `n`, `k`, and `adj` are redefined in each iteration of the loop, so their values depend on the input for each iteration. However, the variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

Since the loop iterates `t` times and each iteration processes a new set of inputs and updates the variables accordingly, the final output state will reflect the state after the last iteration of the loop.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be defined by the last values of `n`, `k`, and the final printed value `L`.

Output State: **the values of `n` and `k` from the last iteration, and the final printed value `L` from the last iteration.**
