The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these inputs. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a` multiplied by `n`. Otherwise, it computes a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and `n` and prints the result.
