The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it outputs two arrays of integers based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the array `a`. The output arrays are constructed such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in each of the two output arrays, and the construction respects the constraints defined by `k`.
