Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements in all cases. Specifically, the code does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. The logic used to construct `l` and `r` is flawed and does not ensure the required property.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Sorting and Selection Process**:
   - The code sorts the first half (`b`) and the second half (`c`) of the array `a`.
   - It then tries to select elements to form `ans1` and `ans2` based on the sorted order, but the selection criteria do not ensure that the bitwise XOR of the selected elements in `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple pairs of the same number and how they should be distributed between `ans1` and `ans2` to ensure the XOR condition is met.
   - The logic for selecting elements from `l` and appending them to `ans1` and `ans2` is not robust and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Verification of XOR Condition**:
   - The code does not verify whether the XOR of `ans1` is equal to the XOR of `ans2` after constructing them. This is critical for ensuring the solution meets the problem requirements.

4. **Example of Failure**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4 1
     1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
     ```
     - The code might output:
       ```
       1 2
       1 2
       ```
       - Here, the XOR of `1 ^ 2` is `3`, and the XOR of `1 ^ 2` is also `3`, which seems correct. However, the code's logic is not guaranteed to work for all inputs.
     - Another input:
       ```
       1
       4 2
       1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
       ```
       - The code might output:
         ```
         1 2 1 2
         3 4 3 4
         ```
         - Here, the XOR of `1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2` is `0`, and the XOR of `3 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 4` is also `0`, which seems correct. However, the code's logic does not handle all cases correctly and might fail for other inputs.

To ensure correctness, the code needs to be revised to guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of the elements in `r` for all possible inputs. A more systematic approach, such as using a backtracking or dynamic programming method, might be necessary to ensure the XOR condition is met for all cases.
