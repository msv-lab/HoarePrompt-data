You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths in a row of the river grid, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports.
def func_1(row, d):

    #State: the first d-1 elements are incremented by 1, and each subsequent element is the sum of its original value, the minimum value in the preceding d elements, and 1.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`. This element is the sum of its original value, the minimum value in the preceding `d` elements, and 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It modifies the list by incrementing the first `d-1` elements by 1 and then each subsequent element by 1 plus the minimum value of the preceding `d` elements. Finally, it returns the last element of the modified list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of rows, m is a positive integer representing the number of columns, k is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, rows is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains m integers, and costs is a list of integers representing the cost of installing supports for each row.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]

    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list, and costs is a list of integers derived from the rows and the value of d)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values including the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), maximum distance between supports (`d`), a 2D list of integers (`rows`), and calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`. It then computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a row, and `func_2` fails to handle the problem constraints properly.

### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Support Costs**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` incorrectly calculates the cost of supports by adding 1 to each cell and then using a sliding window to determine the minimum cost, which does not align with the problem's constraints.
   - The function does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Instead, it simply adds 1 to each cell and then computes the cumulative cost, which is incorrect.

### Issues in `func_2`:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Multiple Bridges**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the cost for each row independently using `func_1` and then sums these costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.
   - This approach does not consider the constraints on the distance `d` between supports across multiple rows. It assumes that the cost for each row can be calculated independently, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. For each row, determine the minimum cost to place supports such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
2. Use dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for placing supports across `k` consecutive rows while respecting the distance constraint `d`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 5 2 2
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0
```
- The correct minimum cost for building 2 bridges with `d=2` should be `8` (as per the problem statement example).
- The provided code will not produce the correct result because it does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the distance constraint `d` across multiple rows.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
