You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program generates a sequence for each test case as follows:
1. It starts by creating a list `nums` containing powers of 2 up to `2^20` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`).
2. It then finds the largest power of 2 in this list that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it.
3. It appends three new values to the list:
   - `k - nums[idx]` (where `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).
   - `k + 1`.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
4. Finally, it prints the length of the modified list and the list itself.

### Correctness Evaluation

#### Condition 1: No subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`
- The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and adding specific values that prevent `k` from being formed as a subsequence sum.

#### Condition 2: For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`
- The sequence initially consists of powers of 2, which can form any sum from 1 to `2^21 - 1` (approximately 2 million). This ensures that all sums up to `n` (up to 1 million) can be formed by appropriate subsequences.
- By removing a specific power of 2 and adding new values, the program ensures that `k` cannot be formed, but other sums up to `n` remain possible.

### Specific Test Cases
Let's check the program against the example cases:

1. **Input:** `2 2`
   - `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`
   - Remove `2` (largest power of 2 ≤ 2)
   - Append `2 - 2 = 0`, `2 + 1 = 3`, `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`
   - Result: `[1, 4, 8, ..., 1048576, 0, 3, 5]`
   - Possible sums: `1, 3, 4, 5, 8, ...` (excluding `2`)

2. **Input:** `6 1`
   - `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`
   - Remove `1` (largest power of 2 ≤ 1)
   - Append `1 - 1 = 0`, `1 + 1 = 2`, `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
   - Result: `[2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576, 0, 2, 3]`
   - Possible sums: `2, 3, 4, 8, ...` (excluding `1`)

3. **Input:** `8 8`
   - `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`
   - Remove `8` (largest power of 2 ≤ 8)
   - Append `8 - 8 = 0`, `8 + 1 = 9`, `8 + 8 + 1 = 17`
   - Result: `[1, 2, 4, 16, ..., 1048576, 0, 9, 17]`
   - Possible sums: `1, 2, 4, 9, 16, ...` (excluding `8`)

4. **Input:** `9 3`
   - `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`
   - Remove `2` (largest power of 2 ≤ 3)
   - Append `3 - 2 = 1`, `3 + 1 = 4`, `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`
   - Result: `[1, 4, 8, ..., 1048576, 1, 4, 6]`
   - Possible sums: `1, 4, 6, 8, ...` (excluding `3`)

5. **Input:** `10 7`
   - `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`
   - Remove `4` (largest power of 2 ≤ 7)
   - Append `7 - 4 = 3`, `7 + 1 = 8`, `7 + 4 + 1 = 12`
   - Result: `[1, 2, 8, ..., 1048576, 3, 8, 12]`
   - Possible sums: `1, 2, 3, 8, 12, ...` (excluding `7`)

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly generate sequences that satisfy both conditions for the given test cases.
