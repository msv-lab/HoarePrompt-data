The code snippet initializes a `deque` named `leaves`. This does not affect the values of other variables like `nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, or `empty`. The only change is the creation of the `leaves` deque.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= `start` <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `leaves` is an empty deque.**
