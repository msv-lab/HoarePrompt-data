Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `expression`. However, the problem requires an optimal splitting of the array `a` derived from the string `s` such that the sum of penalties of the resulting subarrays is minimized.

The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The optimal strategy involves splitting the array in such a way that the sum of penalties is minimized, which is not achieved by simply calculating the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

For example, in the third test case of the problem statement, the input string is `+-+-+-`, and the optimal splitting is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])` which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`. The program, however, would return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which happens to be correct for this specific case but does not generalize to all cases.

Therefore, the program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
