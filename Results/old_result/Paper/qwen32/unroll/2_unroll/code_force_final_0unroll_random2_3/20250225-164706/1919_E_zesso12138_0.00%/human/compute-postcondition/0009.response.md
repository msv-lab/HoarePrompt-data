The provided loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. Since the loop does not modify any variables outside its body, the state of `n`, `p`, `input`, `data`, `index`, and `t` remains unchanged. The only change is that the contents of `results` will have been printed.

Output State: **n is the size of the last processed array p; p is the last processed list of integers; input holds the entire input provided as a string; data is a list of strings obtained by splitting input on whitespace; index is the position in data after processing all t arrays; t is the integer value of data[0]; results is a list of t elements, each being the result of func_1 for the corresponding n and p. The contents of results have been printed.**
