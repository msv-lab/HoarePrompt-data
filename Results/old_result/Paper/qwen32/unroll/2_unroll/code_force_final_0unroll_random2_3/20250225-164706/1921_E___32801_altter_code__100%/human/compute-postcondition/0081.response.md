Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
    - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, which is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
    - `h` and `w` are positive integers within specified ranges.
    - `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers within specified ranges, and they are not equal.
    - `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
    - `n` is the first element of `r`.
    - `m` is the second element of `r`.
    - `x1` is `r[2] + a`.
    - `y1` is either 1 or `m`.
    - `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
    - `y2` is either `r[5]` or `r[5] + (m - r[3])`.
    - `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`.
    - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
    - `a` is either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1`.
    - `b` is `x2 - x1`.
    - `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
    - `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `y1 - r[5]`.
    - If `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is 1, `a` is `y1 - 1`, and `c` is `y2 - 1`.
    - Otherwise, `y1` is `m`, `a` is `m - y1`, and `c` is `y1 - r[5]`.
    - Additional conditions: either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m` or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.

2. **Given Print Statement:**
    - `print('draw')`

### Analysis:

- The print statement `print('draw')` does not depend on any of the variables defined in the initial state. It is a simple string output.
- The value to be printed is explicitly given as `'draw'`.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the print statement will output the string `'draw'`.

### Final Output:

Output: **draw**
