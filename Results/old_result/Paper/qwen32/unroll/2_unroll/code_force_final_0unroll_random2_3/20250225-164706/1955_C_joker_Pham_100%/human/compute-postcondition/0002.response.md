To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `l <= r` is satisfied. The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones mentioned in the loop head, so we can only adjust these.

Given:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `l <= r` translates to `0 <= n - 1`. This inequality holds true for all `n` such that `n ≥ 1`. Given the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, the condition is always satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the values of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0**
