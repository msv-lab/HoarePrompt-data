Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle scenarios where the number of tickets `k` is less than the maximum number of tickets `m` that can be purchased in a single day. The program always attempts to buy `min(m, k)` tickets on each day, but it does not correctly manage the remaining tickets `k` after each purchase. This can lead to incorrect total cost calculations.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- On the first day, you can buy 2 tickets for a total cost of `1 * 2 = 2`. The prices for the remaining days become `[3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- No more tickets are needed, so the total cost is `2`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
6
```

**Explanation of Program Behavior:**
- The program buys `min(3, 2) = 2` tickets on the first day for a cost of `1 * 2 = 2`. The prices for the remaining days become `[3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- The program then attempts to buy `min(3, 0) = 0` tickets on the second day, which does not change the total cost.
- The program continues to attempt to buy tickets on the remaining days, but since `k` is already 0, it does not affect the total cost.
- The total cost remains `2`, but the program incorrectly adds the cost of buying 0 tickets on subsequent days, leading to an incorrect total cost of `6`.

The program needs to correctly handle the scenario where `k` is less than `m` and stop buying tickets once `k` reaches 0. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        t = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
        print(int(c))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program stops attempting to buy tickets once `k` reaches 0, thus avoiding incorrect cost calculations.
