Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to determine if it's possible to sort the array by repeatedly splitting numbers that are at least 10 into their individual digits. However, the logic in the program is flawed. The current implementation checks if the current number and the previous number can be rearranged to form a sorted sequence but does not correctly simulate the process of splitting numbers.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program only checks if the digits of the previous number and the current number can be rearranged to form a sorted sequence. It does not actually split the numbers and check the entire array.
2. The program does not handle the case where multiple splits are needed to sort the array. It only considers the immediate adjacent elements.
3. The program does not correctly simulate the process of splitting numbers and reinserting the digits into the array.

A correct approach would involve repeatedly checking and splitting numbers until no more splits can be performed or until the array is sorted. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
