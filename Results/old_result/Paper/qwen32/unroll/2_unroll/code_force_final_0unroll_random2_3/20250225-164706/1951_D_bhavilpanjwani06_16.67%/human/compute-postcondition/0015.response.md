Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`; otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.**
