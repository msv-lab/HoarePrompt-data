To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze its logic and verify it against the problem requirements and the given example inputs and outputs.

### Analysis of the Program Logic

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a`.

2. **Bitwise Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to -1, which will store the maximum number of segments.
   - It iterates over each bit position from 29 down to 0 (since the maximum value of `x` and `a[i]` is less than \(2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks the `i`-th bit of `x` (`u`) and the count of elements in `a` that have a 1 at the `i`-th bit (`v`).
     - If both `u` and `v` are 0, it skips to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is odd, it returns `ans` immediately because it's impossible to partition the array such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of all segments is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, it tries to form segments such that the XOR of each segment has a 0 at the `i`-th bit and updates the array `a` with these segments.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, it skips to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even, it counts the maximum number of segments that can be formed such that the XOR of each segment has a 0 at the `i`-th bit and updates `ans`.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - After processing all bits, the program returns the maximum of `ans` and `len(a)`, which handles the case where no segments can be formed and the entire array is a valid segment.

### Verification with Example Inputs and Outputs

Let's verify the correctness using the provided example inputs and outputs:

- **First Test Case:**
  - `n = 3`, `x = 1`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
  - The correct output is `2`, which matches the program's output.
  
- **Second Test Case:**
  - `n = 2`, `x = 2`, `a = [1, 1]`
  - The correct output is `2`, which matches the program's output.
  
- **Third Test Case:**
  - `n = 2`, `x = 2`, `a = [1, 3]`
  - The correct output is `1`, which matches the program's output.
  
- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - `n = 2`, `x = 3`, `a = [0, 0]`
  - The correct output is `2`, which matches the program's output.
  
- **Fifth Test Case:**
  - `n = 3`, `x = 2`, `a = [0, 0, 1]`
  - The correct output is `3`, which matches the program's output.
  
- **Sixth Test Case:**
  - `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`
  - The correct output is `-1`, which matches the program's output.
  
- **Seventh Test Case:**
  - `n = 2`, `x = 2`, `a = [2, 3]`
  - The correct output is `1`, which matches the program's output.
  
- **Eighth Test Case:**
  - `n = 5`, `x = 0`, `a = [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]`
  - The correct output is `2`, which matches the program's output.
