To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the code:

1. `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. `s1` is an empty string and will accumulate all characters from `s` as the loop iterates.
3. `s2` is an empty string and will accumulate characters only when the `alphabet` set has only one character left.
4. `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`:
- If `i` is in `alphabet`, it checks if the length of `alphabet` is not equal to 1. If it's not, it removes `i` from `alphabet`.
- If the length of `alphabet` is 1, it means `i` is the last character in `alphabet`. It adds `i` to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Regardless of the above conditions, it adds `i` to `s1`.

Given this behavior, `s1` will always be the same as `s` because every character from `s` is added to `s1`. The variable `s2` will contain characters from `s` only when the `alphabet` set has been reduced to a single character and that character is encountered. The `alphabet` set will be reset to its initial state every time it reaches a single character and that character is added to `s2`.

Thus, the final output state is:
- `s1` will be the same as the input string `s`.
- `s2` will contain characters from `s` that were the last remaining character in `alphabet` at any point during the iteration.
- `alphabet` will contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, as it gets reset whenever it reaches a single character.

Output State: **s1 is the same as the input string s, s2 contains characters from s that were the last remaining character in alphabet at any point, and alphabet is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
