You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a distinct string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it determines the majority character ('A' or 'B') in the string and prints that character. If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. According to the problem description, the program should output one of the letters (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B}) denoting the character that appears most frequently in the string. However, if the counts are equal, the program will always output 'B', which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input string "AABBB" and "BBBAA". Both strings have 3 'B's and 2 'A's, so the program should output 'B' for "AABBB" and 'B' for "BBBAA", but the program will output 'B' for both, which is correct in this case. However, for the input "AABBA", the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal (3 of each), and the program will output 'B', which is incorrect because it should output either 'A' or 'B' as per the problem statement, but consistently outputting 'B' is not specified and could be misleading.

To fix this, the program should handle the tie case explicitly, for example, by choosing one of the letters arbitrarily or by specifying a rule to follow in such cases.

Here is a corrected version of the program that handles the tie case by choosing 'A' if the counts are equal:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif h > l:
            print('B')
        else:
            print('A')  # or print('B'), depending on the desired behavior in case of a tie
```

Without handling the tie case, the original program is incorrect.
