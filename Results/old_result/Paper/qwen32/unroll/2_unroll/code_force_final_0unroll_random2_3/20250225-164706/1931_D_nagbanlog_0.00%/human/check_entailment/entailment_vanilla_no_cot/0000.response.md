Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which is not the correct approach to find a number that, when added to `num`, results in a sum divisible by `x`. 

To correctly find the number of beautiful pairs, for each number `num` in the array, the program should check pairs `(i, j)` where:
- `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` which implies `a_j % x == (-a_i % x) % x`
- `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0` which implies `a_j % y == a_i % y`

Here is the corrected approach:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (-mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This change ensures that the program correctly identifies pairs `(i, j)` that satisfy both conditions for being a beautiful pair.
