Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, it does not ensure that there exists an integer array `b` such that `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i` and `b_i > 0` for every index `i`.

Let's analyze the given code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

The main issue with this code is the condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):`. This condition checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that there exists an array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in the subarray `a` and all elements in `b` are positive.

To be "good", the subarray `a` must satisfy the following:
1. There exists an array `b` such that `sum(a) = sum(b)`.
2. For every index `i`, `a[i] ≠ b[i]`.
3. For every index `i`, `b[i] > 0`.

The current code does not ensure that such an array `b` can be constructed. It only checks if the sum of the subarray is large enough, which is not a sufficient condition.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```

The subarray is `[1, 1, 1]`. The sum of this subarray is `3`. According to the code, it will check if `3 >= 2 * 3`, which is `3 >= 6`, and this is `False`. Therefore, the code will print `NO`.

However, this subarray is actually "good". We can construct an array `b = [2, 1, 0]` but since `b_i > 0` for every index, we need to adjust it slightly, for example, `b = [2, 2, 2]` which is not valid since `a_i ≠ b_i` is not satisfied for all `i`. A valid `b` could be `[2, 2, 1]` or `[2, 1, 2]` or `[1, 2, 2]` etc. where `sum(b) = 5` and `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i`. 

Since the code does not correctly handle this case, it is incorrect.

Thus, the Correctness is **False**.
