Correctness: **False**

The given program contains a logical error in the condition checking and the way it handles the constraints.

Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization Error:**
   The variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to `1000000000.0 + 7` and `-1` respectively. However, `ax` should be initialized to a large value (like `1000000000`) and `bx` to a small value (like `0` or `-1`), but the logic to determine the range `[bx, ax]` is incorrect.

2. **Condition to Check Feasibility:**
   The condition `if bx >= ax:` is used to check if the range `[bx, ax]` is valid. However, this condition is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if bx > ax:` because `k` must be in the range `[bx, ax]` inclusive, which means `bx` should be less than or equal to `ax`.

3. **Counting Valid `k` Values:**
   The loop that counts the number of invalid `k` values (`tmp`) is correct in the sense that it checks if any of the `cx` values fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. However, the condition `if i >= bx and i <= ax:` should be `if bx <= i <= ax:` for consistency.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   The final calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is correct in terms of logic but it will only be executed if `bx > ax` due to the incorrect condition mentioned above.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = 1000000000
        bx = 0
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if bx <= i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')

func()
```

This corrected program should now correctly determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.
