Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `s`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of coins, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D". The function returns `cases`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the number of coins and the corresponding string for each test case.**
