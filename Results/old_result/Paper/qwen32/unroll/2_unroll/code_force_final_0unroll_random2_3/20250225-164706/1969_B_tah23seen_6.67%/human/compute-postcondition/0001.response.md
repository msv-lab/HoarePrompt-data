The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over `sChar`. For the loop to execute, `sChar` must contain at least one string. The state of `s` (which is an empty list) is not relevant to the execution of the loop, as `s` is not mentioned in the loop head.

Given the above, the state needs to be adjusted such that `sChar` contains at least one string that consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5, and `sChar` must have at least one string**
