The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be rearranged in a specific way to ensure that each number is not less than the previous one when digits are considered. It prints 'YES' if the list can be rearranged as per the condition, otherwise 'NO'. The input values `t` and the lists remain unchanged after the function execution.
