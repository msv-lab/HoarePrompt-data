### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its interaction with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The main function (`func_5`) reads the input values `n` and `k` using `func_3`, which reads integers from the input.
   - This matches the problem requirement where each test case starts with two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Determining the Maximum Possible Value**:
   - The function starts by querying `f(1, r)` for `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for `i` ranging from `n` down to `1`.
   - It does this by sending queries of the form `? 1 {i * n}` and checking the response `v`.
   - If `v` is equal to `n`, it means that the maximum possible value `i * n` can be achieved for the entire array, and it breaks the loop with `v = i`.
   - This is a reasonable approach to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved for the entire array.

3. **Checking for Valid Split**:
   - For each possible value `i * v` (where `v` is the maximum value found in the previous step), the function checks if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays, each having `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - It does this by sending queries of the form `? {l} {i * v}` and checking the response.
   - If it can find `k` such subarrays that cover the entire array (`l == n + 1` and `cnt == 0`), it outputs `! i * v` and returns.
   - If no such split is found after checking all possible values, it outputs `! -1`.

4. **Output and Query Limit**:
   - The function ensures that it does not exceed the query limit of `2 * n` by iterating in a structured manner.
   - The output format is correct, and it flushes the output after each query and answer to ensure timely interaction.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k = 1` correctly by checking the entire array.
   - It also handles the case where no valid split is possible by outputting `! -1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_5` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently finds the largest possible value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required properties, while adhering to the query limit.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
