Precondition: **The function takes no arguments but reads from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.**
