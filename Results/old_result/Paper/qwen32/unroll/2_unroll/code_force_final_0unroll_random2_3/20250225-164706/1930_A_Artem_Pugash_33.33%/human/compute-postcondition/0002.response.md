To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the provided code snippet.

The code processes `numCases` number of test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads an integer `numInteger` (which is actually 2n from the problem statement).
2. It reads 2n integers and stores them in the list `numbers`.
3. It sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order.
4. It initializes a variable `suma` to 0.
5. It repeatedly pops the smallest two numbers from the sorted list, adds the smaller of the two to `suma`, and continues until the list is empty.
6. It prints the final value of `suma` for each test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and modifies the variables `numInteger`, `numbers`, and `suma` within its scope, the initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the loop. The variable `numCases` is also not modified within the loop.

The output state will reflect the final printed values of `suma` for each test case, but since we are asked to describe the state of the variables as per the problem's format, we focus on the variables `t`, `n`, and `numCases` as they are the only ones that are not local to the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `numCases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
