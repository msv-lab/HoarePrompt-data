Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program appears to be incorrect and does not accurately count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition. The commented-out section seems to be an attempt at a brute-force solution, but the main part of the program uses a different and incorrect formula to calculate the number of valid pairs.

The correct approach to solve this problem would involve iterating through possible values of `b` and calculating the valid values of `a` for each `b` based on the given condition. The current implementation does not follow this approach and instead uses a formula that does not correctly account for the problem's requirements.
