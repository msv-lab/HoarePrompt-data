The given Python code snippet includes a `print` statement that outputs a specific string. The initial state describes several variables (`i`, `cnt`, `l`, `v`), but these do not directly influence the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string `'! -1'` followed by a flush operation to ensure the output is immediately written to the standard output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('! -1', flush=True)`.
2. The string `'! -1'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately flushed, but it does not affect the content of the string being printed.
4. None of the variables `i`, `cnt`, `l`, or `v` are used in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **! -1**
