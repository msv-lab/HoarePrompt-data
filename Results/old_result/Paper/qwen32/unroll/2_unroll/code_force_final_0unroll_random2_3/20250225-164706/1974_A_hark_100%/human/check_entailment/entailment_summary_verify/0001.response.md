### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on 5x3 screens.
- Each 5x3 screen has 15 cells.
- Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- We need to find the minimum number of screens required.

#### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases and calculates the minimum number of 3x5 screens required to display all applications in each test case.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code is:
```python
import math

func_1()

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells**:
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. The term `bxsfory * 15` suggests that all screens used for 2x2 icons are fully utilized, which is not always true. For example, if `y = 1`, we need 1 screen for the 2x2 icon, which leaves 11 cells, not `15 - 4 = 11`.

2. **Incorrect Adjustment of `x`**:
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because `bxsfory * 15` can be more than the actual cells used by 2x2 icons. For example, if `y = 1`, `bxsfory` is 1, and `bxsfory * 15` is 15, but only 4 cells are occupied by the 2x2 icon.

3. **Simplification Needed**:
   - The logic can be simplified by directly calculating the total number of cells required and then determining the number of screens needed.

#### Corrected Approach:
1. Calculate the total number of cells required for 2x2 icons: `4 * y`.
2. Calculate the total number of cells required for 1x1 icons: `x`.
3. Calculate the total number of cells required: `4 * y + x`.
4. Calculate the number of screens needed: `ceil((4 * y + x) / 15)`.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells_needed = 4 * y + x
        screens_needed = math.ceil(total_cells_needed / 15)
        print(screens_needed)

func_1()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
