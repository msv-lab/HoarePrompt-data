### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Children and Friendships**: We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends, each with a specific friendship value.
2. **Excursions**: The teacher chooses `k` pairs of children randomly and independently. If a chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to find the expected value of the sum of the friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Provided Solution:
The solution calculates:
- `sum_f`: The sum of all initial friendship values.
- `cn2`: The number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
- `p`: Numerator of the fraction representing the expected value.
- `q`: Denominator of the fraction representing the expected value.
- `gcd`: The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` to simplify the fraction.
- The final result is computed as \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Analysis of the Provided Solution:
The provided solution uses the following formulas:
- `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values (`sum_f`)**: This is correctly computed as the sum of all initial friendship values.
2. **Number of Possible Pairs (`cn2`)**: This is correctly computed as \(\binom{n}{2}\).
3. **Numerator (`p`)** and **Denominator (`q`)**:
   - The numerator `p` includes two parts:
     - `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f`: This term considers the expected contribution of the initial friendship values over `k` excursions.
     - `m * k * (k - 1)`: This term accounts for the additional contributions due to the friendships increasing over time.
   - The denominator `q` is `2 * cn2 ** 2`, which is related to the total number of possible pair choices.

However, the formulas used for `p` and `q` do not accurately represent the expected value calculation. The expected value should consider the probability of choosing each pair and the changes in friendship values over the excursions, which involves a more detailed probabilistic analysis.

#### Counterexample:
The original assessment provides a counterexample:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  3 2 3
  1 2 1
  2 3 2
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `10`
- **Actual Output of the Program**: `16`

The program's logic does not correctly account for the expected contributions of each friendship pair over the excursions. The correct expected value can be derived through a more detailed probabilistic analysis.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect logic and the counterexample, the provided program is not correct.

**Final: False**
