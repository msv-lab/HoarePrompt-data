Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the example outputs.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` 1x1 applications and `y` 2x2 applications.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `ap = int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads the number of 1x1 and 2x2 applications.

2. **Calculating Screens:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the `y` 2x2 applications. Since each 5x3 screen can hold up to 2 2x2 applications, `math.ceil(y / 2)` is used.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the number of 1x1 applications needed after placing the 2x2 applications. Each 2x2 application occupies 4 cells, and each screen can hold up to 15 cells. However, the logic here seems incorrect because it subtracts `bxsfory * 15` which is the maximum capacity of `bxsfory` screens, not the actual space used. It should just subtract `y * 4` and then calculate the remaining space.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 applications.
     - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)` outputs the total number of screens.
   - If `x == 0` and `y > 0`:
     - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 applications.
   - If `x > 0` and `y == 0`:
     - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 applications.
   - If `x == 0` and `y == 0`:
     - `print(0)` correctly outputs 0 screens as no applications are present.

### Issues Identified:
The problematic part of the code is the handling of `x` when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The logic `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it incorrectly subtracts the maximum capacity of the screens used for 2x2 applications instead of the actual space used. It should be adjusted to correctly calculate the remaining space for 1x1 applications.

### Correcting the Logic:
The correct logic should be:
- Subtract the actual space used by 2x2 applications from the total cells.
- Calculate the remaining cells needed for 1x1 applications.
- Determine the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 applications.

### Correct Logic Example:
```python
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - 4 * y  # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 applications
            x -= remaining_cells  # Adjust x based on remaining cells
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
```

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the remaining space for 1x1 applications when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.

**Correctness: False**
