The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that the string `s` is not empty because the loop will only execute if there are characters in `s` to iterate over.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- The string `s` must have at least one character.
- The variable `i` will take the value of each character in `s` during each iteration, but we don't need to adjust its initial state since it's defined by the loop.

The states `s1`, `s2`, and `alphabet` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` ≥ 1) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000; `s1` is an empty string; `s2` is an empty string; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**.
