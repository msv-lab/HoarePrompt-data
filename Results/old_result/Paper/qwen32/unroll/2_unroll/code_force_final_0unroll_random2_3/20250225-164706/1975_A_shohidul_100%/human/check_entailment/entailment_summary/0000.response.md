Reasoning: 

The provided program attempts to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation any number of times. The program first checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it outputs "YES". If not, it iterates through the array to find a point where the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing, the second part is non-decreasing, and the first element of the array is greater than or equal to all elements in the second part.

However, the logic in the program has a few issues:
1. After finding a point where the array is not sorted (`a[i-1] > a[i]`), the program checks if the first element of the array is greater than or equal to all elements in the second part (`a[0] >= new[i]`). This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation. The correct check should be if the last element of the first part is less than or equal to all elements in the second part.
2. The program outputs "NO" immediately after checking the first incorrect split point. It should continue checking all possible split points before concluding that the array cannot be sorted by the operation.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:
- Check if the array is already sorted.
- If not, find the first point where the array is not sorted.
- Check if the array can be split at this point such that the last element of the first part is less than or equal to all elements in the second part.
- If such a split is found, output "YES". If no such split is found after checking all possible points, output "NO".

Given the issues in the provided program, it is not correct as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
