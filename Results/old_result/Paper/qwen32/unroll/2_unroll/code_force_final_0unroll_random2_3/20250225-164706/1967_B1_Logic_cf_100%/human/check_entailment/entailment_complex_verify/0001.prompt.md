You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After processing all test cases, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the final printed values of `ans` for each test case are the outputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`, and then computes and prints a specific value `ans` based on these inputs. The value of `ans` is calculated by starting with `n` and adding the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This process is repeated for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem with the following steps:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the values of `n` and `m`.
   - Initialize `ans` to `n`.
   - Iterate `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)` (inclusive).
   - For each `b`, increment `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\).
   - Print `ans`.

### Verification
Let's verify if the logic of the program aligns with the problem's requirements.

#### Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This is correct because for `b = 1`, all `a` from 1 to `n` will satisfy the condition since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1\).

2. **Loop for `b`**: The loop iterates `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This is correct because the problem requires `1 \leq b \leq m` and the condition is symmetric in `a` and `b`.

3. **Condition Check**: The program increments `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\). This is incorrect. The condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The given formula does not correctly account for this condition.

### Correct Formula
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find pairs (a, b) such that:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
This can be simplified by considering the gcd and the range of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b). The formula used to increment `ans` is not correct for the given problem's requirement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
