You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments but reads from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: After processing all test cases, the program will have printed 'Bob' if the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have is even, and 'Alice' if the difference is odd for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. For each test case, it prints 'Bob' if the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have is even, and 'Alice' if the difference is odd.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program for the described problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob have `a` and `b` coins respectively.
- They take turns, starting with Alice.
- In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or not, then must remove one coin from the current wallet.
- The player who can't make a move loses.
- Both play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- If `a == b`, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by mirroring the second player's moves until the game reaches a state where both wallets have 1 coin. At that point, Bob will be forced to take the last coin, and Alice will win.
- If `a != b`, the player with more coins can force a win by always making the difference between the number of coins in their wallets odd after their turn. This ensures that the other player is always left with an even difference, eventually leading to a losing position.

### Given Program Analysis:
The provided program determines the winner based on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd:
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

### Correctness Verification:
- **Case 1: `a == b`**
  - The difference is 0, which is even. According to the program, Bob wins. However, as per the observations, Alice should win by mirroring Bob's moves until the end.
  - This is a contradiction.

- **Case 2: `a != b`**
  - If the difference is odd, Alice wins, which aligns with the observations.
  - If the difference is even, Bob wins, which contradicts the observations (Bob should lose if the difference is even because Alice can always force a win).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal strategies described in the problem statement.

### Example of Incorrectness:
For `a = 1` and `b = 1`:
- The program outputs "Bob".
- The correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can mirror Bob's moves until the end, ensuring her win.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
