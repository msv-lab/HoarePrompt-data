Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a distinct string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it determines the majority character ('A' or 'B') in the string and prints that character. If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it prints 'B'.**
