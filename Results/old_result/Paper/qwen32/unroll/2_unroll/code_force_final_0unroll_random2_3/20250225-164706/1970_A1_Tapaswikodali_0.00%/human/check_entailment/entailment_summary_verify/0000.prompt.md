You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a balanced parentheses string `s` and prints a new string formed by sorting the characters of `s` based on a tuple `(balance, -i, char)`, where `balance` is the net count of `'('` minus `')'` up to the character, `-i` is the negative index of the character, and `char` is the character itself.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the code to understand why it works:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program iterates through the input string `s` and calculates the prefix balance for each character. It increments the balance for an opening parenthesis '(' and decrements it for a closing parenthesis ')'. This step ensures that the balance at each position is correctly computed.

2. **Storing Details**: For each character, the program stores a tuple containing the prefix balance, the negative of the position (to handle tie-breaking by decreasing order of position), and the character itself. The negative position is used to ensure that when sorting, ties in balance are broken by the highest position first, which is equivalent to the lowest position in the original sequence.

3. **Sorting**: The list of tuples is sorted. Sorting by balance first ensures that characters with lower balances come earlier in the result, and the tie-breaking by negative position ensures that in the case of ties in balance, characters that appear later in the original sequence come first.

4. **Reconstructing the Result**: After sorting, the program extracts the characters from the sorted list of tuples and joins them to form the final balanced shuffle sequence.

The program handles all edge cases, including sequences with only opening or closing parentheses (though such sequences would not be valid balanced sequences as per the problem statement, the program will still produce a correct result for them).

Given that the program correctly implements the described algorithm and handles all potential cases as per the problem statement, it is deemed correct.

Thus, the output is:
Correctness: **True**
