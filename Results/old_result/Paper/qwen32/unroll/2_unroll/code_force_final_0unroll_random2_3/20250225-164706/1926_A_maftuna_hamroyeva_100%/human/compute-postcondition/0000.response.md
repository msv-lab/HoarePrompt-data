The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input is expected to be an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, as per the initial state description. The other part of the initial state, which mentions the strings for each test case, is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.**
