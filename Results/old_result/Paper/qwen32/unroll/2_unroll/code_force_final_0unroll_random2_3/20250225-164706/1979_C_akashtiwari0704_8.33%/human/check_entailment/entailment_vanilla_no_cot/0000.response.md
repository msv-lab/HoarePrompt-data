Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each individual multiplier to determine the bet for each outcome. This approach does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

Let's consider the logic needed to solve the problem correctly:

1. For each outcome, we need to ensure that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the bet on that outcome multiplied by its respective multiplier.
2. One simple strategy is to set the bet for each outcome such that the total sum of bets is minimized while still satisfying the condition for each outcome.

A correct approach could be:
- Set the bet for the i-th outcome to 1 and check if the total sum of bets is less than the amount received for the i-th outcome (i.e., `1 * k_i`). If so, this satisfies the condition.
- If we set all bets to 1 and the condition is not met, we need to increase the bet for some outcomes. However, a simpler strategy is to set the bet for the i-th outcome to `floor((sum_of_all_bets + 1) / k_i) + 1` to ensure the condition is met.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        # Initialize bets to 1
        x = [1] * bets
        total_sum = bets
        valid = True
        
        for i in range(bets):
            if a[i] * x[i] <= total_sum:
                valid = False
                break
        
        if not valid:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ' '.join(map(str, x))
            print(ans)

# This is a simplified version and might not cover all edge cases.
# A more robust solution would involve adjusting bets dynamically.
```

However, a more robust solution would involve dynamically adjusting the bets to ensure the condition is met for all outcomes. The provided program does not handle this correctly.
