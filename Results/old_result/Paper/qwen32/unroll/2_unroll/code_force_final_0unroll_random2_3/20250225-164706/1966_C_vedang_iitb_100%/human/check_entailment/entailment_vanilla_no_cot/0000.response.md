Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The logic based on finding the MEX (minimum excludant) size of the piles and comparing it with the maximum size is incorrect for this problem. 

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, specifically the "Subtract a Fixed Number from Each Pile" game. The key to solving this problem is to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of all piles is zero at the start of Alice's turn, she will lose if both players play optimally. Otherwise, she will win.

Here is the correct approach:

1. Calculate the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes) for each test case.
2. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for sz in a:
            nim_sum ^= sz
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This code correctly implements the solution based on the Nim-sum concept.
