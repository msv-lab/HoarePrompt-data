To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, two integers `n` and `m` are read from the input.
3. The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`.
4. The inner loop runs from `b = 2` to `min(n, m)`, inclusive.
5. In each iteration of the inner loop, `ans` is updated by adding the value of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it.
6. After the inner loop completes, the value of `ans` is printed.

Since the code processes each test case independently and prints the result for each one, the final output state will consist of `t` printed values of `ans` for each test case.

The output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **For each test case, the value of `ans` after processing `n` and `m` is printed. The variable `t` remains unchanged and represents the number of test cases.**

However, since we need to describe the output state in terms of the variables in the loop head and body, we can say:

Output State: **After processing all test cases, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the final printed values of `ans` for each test case are the outputs.**
