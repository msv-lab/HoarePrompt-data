### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the largest value \( m \) such that the array \( a \) can be split into exactly \( k \) subarrays, where each subarray satisfies \( f(l, r) = m \). The function `func_5` is the main function that handles the logic for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's approach:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The function `func_5` reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) which represent the length of the array and the number of subarrays, respectively.
   - It initializes a variable \( v \) to 1.

2. **Determine the Maximum Possible Value:**
   - The program iterates from \( n \) down to 1, querying the function \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \) for each \( i \).
   - It sends a query of the form `? 1 {i * n}` and reads the response.
   - If the response \( v \) is \( n \), it sets \( v \) to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop. This means that the maximum possible value of \( m \) is \( i \cdot n \).

3. **Check for Valid Split:**
   - The program then iterates from 1 to \( \frac{n}{k} \) (inclusive), checking if it can split the array into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray satisfies \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \).
   - For each \( i \), it initializes `cnt` to \( k \) and `l` to 1.
   - It repeatedly sends queries of the form `? {l} {i * v}` and updates `l` to the response plus 1, decrementing `cnt` each time.
   - If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` reaches \( n + 1 \), it means that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays with each subarray having \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \). It then prints `! {i * v}` and reads the response to confirm.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid split, it prints `! -1`.

### Analysis:

- **Query Limit:** The program makes at most \( 2n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
- **Correctness of Logic:** The logic to determine the maximum possible value \( m \) and to check for a valid split seems correct. It correctly handles the constraints and the interactive nature of the problem.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as \( k = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \) correctly.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: True**
