Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to sort the array using the described operations. The main issue lies in the logic used to check if the array can be sorted. Specifically, the program checks if splitting a number can make the array sorted, but it does not consider all possible splits and their implications on the rest of the array.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element is less than the previous one.
2. If it finds such a pair, it splits the previous element and checks if the resulting array (including the current element) is sorted.
3. If the resulting array is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
4. If the loop completes without setting `ans` to `False`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, this approach is flawed because:
- It only checks one possible split for each pair of elements.
- It does not consider the effect of splitting elements on the rest of the array.
- It does not account for the possibility of splitting multiple elements in a way that could result in a sorted array.

A correct approach would involve simulating the splitting operations and checking if the resulting array can be sorted. This might require a more complex algorithm, such as a backtracking or dynamic programming approach, to explore all possible splits and their outcomes.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect, and the correct response is:

Correctness: **False**
