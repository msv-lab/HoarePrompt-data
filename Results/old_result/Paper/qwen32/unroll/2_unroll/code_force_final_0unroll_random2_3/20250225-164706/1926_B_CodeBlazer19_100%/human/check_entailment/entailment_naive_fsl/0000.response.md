Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle and Square Detection**:
   - The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. However, a triangle can have multiple rows with different numbers of '1's, not just one '1' per row.
   - The program checks if a row contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. However, this check is not sufficient to confirm that the shape is a square, as a triangle can also have multiple '1's in a row.

2. **Lack of Detailed Shape Validation**:
   - The program does not validate the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square. For example, it does not check if the '1's form a centered triangle or a square with equal distances from the left edge.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the triangle is upside down.

3. **Incorrect Output Logic**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if any row has exactly one '1', the shape is a triangle. This is not always true, as a square can also have rows with a single '1' if it is positioned at the edge of the grid.
   - The program does not handle cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
00100
01110
11111
01110
00100
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```
In this case, the program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because it encounters rows with more than one '1', which could be part of either a square or a triangle. However, the shape in the grid is actually a triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and should be revised to properly detect the specific patterns of triangles and squares as described in the problem statement.
