Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an `n` by `n` grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's, with the size of the shape greater than 1. The function outputs 'TRIANGLE' if a triangle is detected and 'SQUARE' if a square is detected for each test case.**
