Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. According to the problem description, the game's outcome depends on whether the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) is odd or even. If the number of `'U'` coins is odd, Alice wins (`'YES'`), and if it is even, Bob wins (`'NO'`). The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `'U'` coins in the string `s` and returns `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on whether the count is odd or even, respectively. Therefore, the program is correct.
