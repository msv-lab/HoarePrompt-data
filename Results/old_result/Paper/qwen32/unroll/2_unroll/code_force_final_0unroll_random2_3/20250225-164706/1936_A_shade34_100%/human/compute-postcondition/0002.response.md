Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` which is a permutation of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The function returns the number of indices `i` such that `p_i = i` for each test case.**
