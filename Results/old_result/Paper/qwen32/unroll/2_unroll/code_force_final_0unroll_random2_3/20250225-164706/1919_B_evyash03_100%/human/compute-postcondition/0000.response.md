The code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 0. The initial state specifies that `expression` is a string consisting of the characters "+" and "-", and `length` is an integer representing the length of `expression`, with the constraint 1 <= length <= 5000. The execution of the code does not affect `expression` or `length`, only `count` is set to 0.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of the characters "+" and "-", `length` is an integer such that `length` = len(`expression`) and 1 <= `length` <= 5000; `count` is 0.**
