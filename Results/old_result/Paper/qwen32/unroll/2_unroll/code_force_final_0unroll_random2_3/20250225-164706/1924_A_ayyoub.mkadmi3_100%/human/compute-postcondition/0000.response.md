Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000. Additionally, the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `s1` is an empty string.**

In simple terms, the string `s` remains unchanged, and a new variable `s1` is initialized as an empty string.
