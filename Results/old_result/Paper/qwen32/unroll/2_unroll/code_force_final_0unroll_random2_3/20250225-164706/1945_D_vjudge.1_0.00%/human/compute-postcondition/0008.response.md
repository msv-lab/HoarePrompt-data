To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the expression `n - k` in the `range` function.

Here's the loop statement:
```
for i in range(n - k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute at least once, the expression `n - k` must be greater than 0. This means `n` must be greater than `k`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized automatically by the `range` function. We do not need to adjust its initial state because it is set to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.

2. **`n` and `k`**: The loop will execute if `n - k > 0`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `k`.

3. **`lista_A` and `lista_B`**: These lists are mentioned in the state description but are not part of the loop head. Thus, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **`soma_b` and `pref`**: These variables are mentioned in the state description but are not part of the loop head. Thus, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than `k`.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lista_A` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the cost `a_i` for each person in the queue, but in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input, where each element in `lista_B` is a positive integer representing the cost `b_i` for each person in the queue, but now in the reversed order, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is 0**
