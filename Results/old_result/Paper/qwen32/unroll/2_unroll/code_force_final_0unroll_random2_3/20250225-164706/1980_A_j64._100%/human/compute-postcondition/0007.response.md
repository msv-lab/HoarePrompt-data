Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `a`, `m` is an integer representing a threshold, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates the sum of `(m - count[i])` for all characters `i` in the string `a` where the count of `i` is less than `m`. The result is the total number of additional occurrences needed for each character to reach at least `m` occurrences.**
