### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by using dynamic programming. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the program step-by-step:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a `dp` array of size `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0. This array is used to keep track of the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum.
   - An `offset` of `n` is used to map the range of possible prefix sums (which can range from `-n` to `n`) to indices in the `dp` array (which range from `0` to `2 * n`).

2. **Base Case:**
   - The initial state of the `dp` array is set such that `dp[offset] = 1`. This means there is exactly one way to have a prefix sum of `0` at the start (i.e., an empty prefix).

3. **DP Transition:**
   - The program iterates over each element in the prefix sum array `p`. For each element, it updates the `dp` array based on the possible transitions from the previous state.
   - Specifically, if `dp[j]` is non-zero, it means there is a way to achieve a prefix sum of `j - offset` up to that point. The program then considers the next possible prefix sums: `j + 1` (corresponding to adding `1` to the current prefix sum) and `j - 1` (corresponding to adding `-1` to the current prefix sum).
   - The `new_dp` array is updated accordingly, and after processing all elements up to `i`, `dp` is updated to `new_dp`.

4. **Final Computation:**
   - After processing all elements, the program computes the final sum as `p[-1] + offset`, which corresponds to the last element in the sorted prefix sum array `p` adjusted by the offset.
   - The program then returns the value at index `final_sum` in the `dp` array, which represents the number of ways to achieve the last prefix sum in the sorted array.

5. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The dynamic programming approach correctly models the problem of counting the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum, given that each element in the hidden array `a` can be either `1` or `-1`.
   - The use of modulo `998244353` ensures that the results do not overflow and remain within the required constraints.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads and processes multiple test cases, storing the results in a list and printing them at the end. This is correctly handled by the `func_2` function.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output requirements, and the logic for counting the number of valid initial arrays `a` is sound.

**Correctness: True**
