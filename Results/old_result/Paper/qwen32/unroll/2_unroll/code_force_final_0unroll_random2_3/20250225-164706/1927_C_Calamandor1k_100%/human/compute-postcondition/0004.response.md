Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cases` containing tuples. Each tuple consists of integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, the function returns 'YES' if certain conditions are met based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The results for all test cases are returned as a list.**
