#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks; freq is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from arr and values as their respective counts.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers where the first element indicates the number of test cases, and each subsequent test case starts with an integer representing the number of sticks followed by the lengths of those sticks. It calculates and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 4.
