The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The initial state provided does not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference any of the variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`) in the print statement. The print statement is static and will always output 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
