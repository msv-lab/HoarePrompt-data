The loop iterates over the string `num` from the last character to the first, checking if the character is '0'. If it encounters a character that is not '0', it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it increments `tot` by 1. Essentially, `tot` counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of the original integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9; `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`.**
