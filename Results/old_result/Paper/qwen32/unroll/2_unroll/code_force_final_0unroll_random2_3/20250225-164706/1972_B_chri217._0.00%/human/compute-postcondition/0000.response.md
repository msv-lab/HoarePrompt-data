The code snippet counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `num_up`. Given that `s` is a string of 'U' and 'D' characters, `num_up` will hold the number of facing-up coins.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, and the length of `s` is a positive integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `num_up` is the count of 'U' characters in `s`.**
