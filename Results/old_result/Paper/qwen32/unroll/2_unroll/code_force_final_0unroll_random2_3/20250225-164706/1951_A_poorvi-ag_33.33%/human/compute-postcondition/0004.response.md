The only object in the loop head is the variable `r`, which iterates over the list `results`. For the loop to execute, the list `results` must contain at least one element. The variable `r` does not need to be explicitly adjusted before the loop starts, as it will be assigned the first element of `results` when the loop begins.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element. Given that `results` is described as a list of 'yes' or 'no' based on the input conditions after `t` iterations, we need to ensure that `results` is not empty.

State: **`results` is a list of 'yes' or 'no' based on the input conditions after t iterations and must have at least 1 element**
