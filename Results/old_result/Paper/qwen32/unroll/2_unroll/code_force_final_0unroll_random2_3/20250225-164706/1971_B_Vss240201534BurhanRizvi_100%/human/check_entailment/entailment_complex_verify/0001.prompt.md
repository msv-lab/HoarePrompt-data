You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: t is 0, and s is the last string processed by the loop (not retained after the loop).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then processes each string to determine if it can be rearranged to form a different string. If the string can be rearranged, it prints 'Yes' followed by one possible rearrangement; otherwise, it prints 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and verify if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - The program checks if the length of the string `s` is 1. If it is, it outputs "No" because a single character string cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Handling Strings with All Identical Characters:**
   - The program checks if all characters in the string `s` are identical by converting the string to a set and checking its length. If the length of the set is 1 and the length of the string is greater than 1, it outputs "No" because rearranging such a string will always result in the same string.
   - This part is also correct.

3. **Generating a Different String:**
   - For strings that can be rearranged to form a different string, the program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string.
   - If the generated string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, the program then attempts to create a different string by rotating the string (i.e., moving the first character to the end).
   - This approach ensures that the generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2` if a different rearrangement is possible.
   - The program outputs "No" if no different rearrangement is possible.

### Potential Issues

- **Randomness and Reliability:**
  - The use of `random.sample` introduces randomness, which means the program might not always produce the same output for the same input. However, the problem statement allows for any valid rearrangement, so this is acceptable.
  - The fallback mechanism of rotating the string ensures that the program will always provide a correct answer when a rearrangement is possible.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with all identical characters.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles all specified edge cases and ensures that the output meets the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
