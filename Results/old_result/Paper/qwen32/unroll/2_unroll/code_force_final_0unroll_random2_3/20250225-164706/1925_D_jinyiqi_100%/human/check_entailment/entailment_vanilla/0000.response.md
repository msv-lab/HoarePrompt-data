To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided solution.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of pairs who are friends.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - For each of the `m` pairs, we have `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Process**:
   - For each excursion, a pair of children is chosen randomly.
   - If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The result should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its simplest form, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output one integer which is the answer to the problem.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - `M`: Modulo value \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **For each test case**:
   - Read `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Calculate the sum of initial friendship values (`sum_f`).
   - Calculate the total number of possible pairs (`cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`).
   - Calculate `p` and `q`:
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`
   - Simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - Calculate \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) and print the result.

### Correctness:
The formula used for `p` and `q` in the program seems incorrect. Here's why:

- The expected value calculation should consider the probability of picking a friend pair and the probability of picking a non-friend pair.
- The given formula does not correctly account for the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

The correct approach involves:
- Calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair over `k` excursions.
- Using combinatorial mathematics to compute the expected sum of friendship values.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
