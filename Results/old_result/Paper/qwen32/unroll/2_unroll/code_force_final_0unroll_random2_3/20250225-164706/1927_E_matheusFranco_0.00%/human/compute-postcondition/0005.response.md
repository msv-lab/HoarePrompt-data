The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. Since `k` is already given as an integer such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0.

The state before the loop starts includes `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v`. However, only `i` and `k` can be adjusted according to the loop head. Since `k` is already specified and ensures the loop will execute, we need to set `i` to its initial value, which is `0` (as `range(k)` starts from `0`).

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `0`, `idx` is `0`, `idx_v` is `1`, `curr_v` is `1`, `i` is `0`**
