Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case is represented by a tuple (n, x, y, a), where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
