In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `a` (the list of integers) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted directly to ensure the loop executes.

Given that the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variables `n` and `a` do not affect whether the loop starts executing or not; they will be used within the loop body, which is not provided here.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than or equal to 1. The variables `n` and `a` remain as they are since they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9**
