### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in a queue of `n` people. The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (`numero_testes`) and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` is responsible for reading the input for a single test case, performing the necessary calculations, and printing the result.

Let's analyze `func_1` in detail:

1. **Input Reading and Reversing Lists:**
   - `n` and `k` are read, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position for Kirill, respectively.
   - Two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, are read and reversed. This suggests that the logic is considering the problem from the end of the queue towards the beginning.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - `soma_b` and `pref` are initialized to 0. `soma_b` is used to accumulate the `b_i` values, and `pref` is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - The loop `for i in range(n - k):` processes the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists.
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, and resets `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - The second loop `for i in range(n - k, n):` processes the last `k` elements of the reversed lists.
     - It updates `resultado` with the minimum value between the current `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
     - It adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b` after each iteration.

This logic seems to be attempting to find the minimum cost to bring Kirill to one of the first `m` positions by considering the costs of bribing people in the queue.

### Verification with Example Input:

Let's verify the logic with the first test case from the example input:

```
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

- Reversed lists: `lista_A = [9, 6, 3, 7]` and `lista_B = [5, 8, 3, 4]`
- `n = 4` and `k = 2`, so `n - k = 2`.
- First loop (`i = 0` to `i = 1`):
  - `i = 0`: `lista_A[0] < lista_B[0]` is `9 < 5` (False), so `soma_b += 5` → `soma_b = 5`.
  - `i = 1`: `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]` is `6 < 8` (True), so `pref += soma_b + lista_A[1]` → `pref = 5 + 6 = 11` and `soma_b = 0`.
- Second loop (`i = 2` to `i = 3`):
  - `i = 2`: `resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[2])` → `resultado = min(inf, 11 + 0 + 3) = 14` and `soma_b += lista_B[2]` → `soma_b = 3`.
  - `i = 3`: `resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[3])` → `resultado = min(14, 11 + 3 + 7) = 14` and `soma_b += lista_B[3]` → `soma_b = 7`.

The function correctly calculates the minimum cost as `14`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and verification with the example input, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
