To determine the output state, let's analyze the loop and how it modifies the variables. Here's the loop again for reference:

```python
for v in reversed(b):
    p = p * v
    ans.append(p)
```

Given the initial state:
- `b` is a permutation of `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.
- `l` is equal to `n` or more, and `r` is less than 0 or equal to -1, indicating that all elements of `a` have been processed.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `p` is 1.

The loop iterates over each element `v` in the reversed list `b`. In each iteration:
1. `p` is updated to `p * v`.
2. The current value of `p` is appended to the list `ans`.

After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, starting from the last element of `b` to the first. The variable `p` will hold the product of all elements in `b`.

Let's denote the elements of `b` as `b[0], b[1], ..., b[n-1]`. The loop processes these elements in reverse order: `b[n-1], b[n-2], ..., b[0]`.

The value of `ans` after the loop will be:
- `ans[0] = b[n-1]`
- `ans[1] = b[n-1] * b[n-2]`
- `ans[2] = b[n-1] * b[n-2] * b[n-3]`
- ...
- `ans[n-1] = b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[0]`

The final value of `p` will be the product of all elements in `b`:
- `p = b[n-1] * b[n-2] * ... * b[0]`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`b` is a permutation of `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is equal to `n` or more, and `r` is less than 0 or equal to -1, indicating that all elements of `a` have been processed; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order; `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.**
