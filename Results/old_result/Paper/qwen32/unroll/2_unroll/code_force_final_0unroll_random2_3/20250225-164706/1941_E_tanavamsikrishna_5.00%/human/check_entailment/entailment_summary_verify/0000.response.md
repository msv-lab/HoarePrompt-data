### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1`
The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. The current implementation of `func_1` is:
```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]
```
This function iterates through the row and tries to calculate the cost of placing supports. However, the key issue here is that it does not correctly handle the constraint that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The current implementation simply adds 1 to each cell and then uses a sliding window to determine the minimum cost, which does not ensure that the supports are placed with the required distance constraint.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
The function `func_2` reads the input values and uses `func_1` to calculate the cost of placing supports for each row. It then sums the costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums. The current implementation of `func_2` is:
```python
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))
```
This function correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and then sums these costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost. However, as mentioned earlier, `func_1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the distance constraint `d`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Support Costs in `func_1`**:
   - The function does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Instead, it simply adds 1 to each cell and then computes the cumulative cost, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Multiple Bridges in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the cost for each row independently using `func_1` and then sums these costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.
   - This approach does not consider the constraints on the distance `d` between supports across multiple rows. It assumes that the cost for each row can be calculated independently, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for placing supports across `k` consecutive rows while respecting the distance constraint `d`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements due to the issues identified in `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
