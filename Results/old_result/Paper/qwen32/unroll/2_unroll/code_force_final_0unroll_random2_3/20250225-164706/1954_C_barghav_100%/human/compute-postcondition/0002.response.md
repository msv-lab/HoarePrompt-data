Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, the length of `x` and `y` is the same for each test case; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of either `x` or `y`; `b` is a list of characters from the input string; `f` is 0.**

The variable `f` is initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
