You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string of length n containing only the characters "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is the same as `int(data[0])`, `n` is the value from the last test case, `s` is the string from the last test case, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the number of 'U' characters in each test case string.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is the same as `int(data[0])`, `n` is the value from the last test case, `s` is the string from the last test case, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the number of 'U' characters in each test case string. The elements of `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd. If it is, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U'). The key insight is that the game state is ultimately determined by the number of 'U' coins, and the player who faces a situation with an odd number of 'U' coins can always force a win by playing optimally. Conversely, a player who faces an even number of 'U' coins will always lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Here's a brief explanation of the logic:
- The game involves flipping adjacent coins when a 'U' coin is removed.
- The parity of the number of 'U' coins remains invariant modulo 2 after each move (since removing a 'U' and flipping two adjacent coins either leaves the count unchanged or changes it by 2).
- Therefore, if the initial number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that she faces an odd number of 'U' coins on her turn, eventually winning the game.
- If the initial number of 'U' coins is even, Bob can always ensure that he faces an even number of 'U' coins on his turn, eventually winning the game.

The program correctly counts the number of 'U' coins and checks if it is odd or even, appending 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly. It handles multiple test cases and prints the results as specified in the problem description.

Since the logic and implementation match the problem description and handle all possible cases correctly, the program is correct.
