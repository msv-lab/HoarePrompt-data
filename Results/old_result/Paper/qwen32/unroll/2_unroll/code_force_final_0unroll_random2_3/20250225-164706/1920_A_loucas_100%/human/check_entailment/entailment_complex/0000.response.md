### Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then reads `n` constraints and categorizes them into three lists:
     - `big`: Stores the values for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).
     - `less`: Stores the values for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
     - `no`: Stores the values for constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).

2. **Calculating the Range:**
   - The number of valid integers `k` is initially calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This represents the count of integers from the smallest upper bound to the largest lower bound, inclusive.
   - If `num` (the calculated range) is less than 1, it means there is no overlap between the upper and lower bounds, and the program outputs `0`.

3. **Handling `not equal to` Constraints:**
   - For each value in `no`, if it falls within the valid range (`max(big) <= no[i] <= min(less)`), it is subtracted from `num` because such values cannot be valid for `k`.
   - Finally, the program prints the adjusted `num` value, which represents the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the constraints as described in the problem statement. It ensures that:
- The range of valid integers `k` is accurately calculated.
- Values that should be excluded due to the `not equal to` constraints are properly subtracted from the count.
- Edge cases, such as no overlap between upper and lower bounds, are handled by outputting `0`.

Given the provided explanation and the logic of the program, it appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
