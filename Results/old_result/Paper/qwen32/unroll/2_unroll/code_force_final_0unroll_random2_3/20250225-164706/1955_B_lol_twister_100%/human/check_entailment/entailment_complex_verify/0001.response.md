### Reasoning

The provided program aims to determine if a given array of integers can be rearranged to form a specific progressive square based on the rules described in the problem. Here's a detailed evaluation of the program using the annotated code and the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
   - It then reads the array \( l \) of \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Progressive Square Generation**:
   - The program determines \( a_{1,1} \) as the minimum value in the array \( l \).
   - It constructs the progressive square by iterating over each cell \( (k, h) \) (where \( k \) and \( h \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \)) and calculates the value using the formula \( a_{k+1,h+1} = a_{1,1} + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \).
   - These values are stored in the list \( li \).

3. **Verification**:
   - Both the generated list \( li \) and the input list \( l \) are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are, it means the array can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Analysis with Annotations

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - The variables \( t \), \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and \( l \) are correctly initialized as per the problem description.
  
- **Inside Function `func_1`**:
  - The minimum value of the list \( l \) is correctly identified as \( a \).
  - The list \( li \) is populated with values calculated using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for all valid \( k \) and \( h \).
  - Both \( li \) and \( l \) are sorted.
  - The comparison of the sorted lists \( li \) and \( l \) is performed correctly to determine if the array can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

### Correctness

- The program correctly identifies \( a_{1,1} \) as the minimum value in the array \( l \).
- It accurately constructs the progressive square using the provided formula.
- It correctly compares the sorted versions of the generated list and the input list to verify if the array can form the progressive square.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The annotations and the step-by-step reasoning confirm that the program behaves as expected for the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
