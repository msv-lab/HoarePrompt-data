### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `r` is a list that will store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, `n` is the number of constraints.
   - `cx` is a set that stores the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000000 + 7) to find the minimum `x` for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to find the maximum `x` for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program checks the type:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Calculating the Result:**
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there's no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, so the result for that test case is 0.
   - If `bx < ax`, it calculates the number of integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`:
     - `tmp` counts the number of integers in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - The result for that test case is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for all test cases are printed, one per line.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly identifies the range `[bx, ax]` for valid values of `k` based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
- It correctly counts the number of integers within this range that are not excluded by constraints of type 3.
- The logic for handling constraints and calculating the result seems correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
