### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and verify if it correctly solves the problem based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer. This is used for reading `n`, `k`, the list of prices for Alice (`a_i`), and the list of prices for Bob (`b_i`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the code initializes a heap and a list `remaining_items`. However, `remaining_items` is not used in the provided code.
   - It reads `n` and `k`, then reads the lists of prices for Alice (`prices`) and Bob (`bonuses`).
   - The prices for Alice are negated (`neg_prices`) to facilitate the use of a min-heap as a max-heap.
   - The items are combined into tuples of (`neg_price`, `bonus`) and sorted by the bonus value (`b_i`).

3. **Initial Selection of Items**:
   - The code selects the first `k` items based on the sorted list of items and adds them to the heap. This step ensures that the first `k` items with the highest bonuses are considered for Bob to take for free.

4. **Calculating Profit**:
   - The function `func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap)` calculates the initial profit by summing the bonuses of the selected items and the net profit from the remaining items where `a_i + b_i >= 0`.
   - The code then iteratively evaluates the remaining items. For each item, it updates the current profit by adjusting for the inclusion or exclusion of the item and the item removed from the heap.
   - The heap ensures that the `k` items with the highest bonuses are always considered for Bob to take for free.

5. **Maximizing Profit**:
   - The code keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during the evaluation of items.
   - The final output for each test case is the maximum profit found.

### Verification:

- The code correctly handles the input and processes each test case independently.
- The use of a heap ensures that the `k` items with the highest bonuses are considered for Bob to take for free, which is optimal for minimizing Alice's profit.
- The profit calculation correctly considers the net profit from the remaining items and updates the maximum profit as items are evaluated.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine Alice's maximum profit under the constraints given in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
