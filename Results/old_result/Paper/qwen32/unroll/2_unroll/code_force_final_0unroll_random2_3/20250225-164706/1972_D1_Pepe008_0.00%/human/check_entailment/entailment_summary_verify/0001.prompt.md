You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`. The result is the sum of a series of values derived from `a` and `b`, adjusted by subtracting one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The program is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements this logic.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.

2. **Logic to Calculate Valid Pairs:**
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The formula used to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\) is:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
     \]
     where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).
   - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to the sum.
   - Finally, it subtracts 1 from the sum and prints the result.

However, there are several issues with this approach:
- The formula used to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values is not derived from the problem's condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The logic seems to be incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly.

Let's write a correct version of the program for comparison:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# func()
```

The correct version of the program iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. This is the straightforward and correct way to solve the problem.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
