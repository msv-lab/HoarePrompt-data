In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer value obtained from `input()`. The loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided to the program will result in a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Input Value**: The loop will execute if the integer value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 0. Given the context, this integer value corresponds to `t`, the number of test cases.

2. **State Adjustment**: The state before the loop should ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 <= t <= 10^4).

Since the loop variable `_` is not used inside the loop body, we do not need to adjust its state. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**State**: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a valid number of test cases as per the problem statement.
