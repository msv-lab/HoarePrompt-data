Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a string of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it outputs 'A' if the string contains more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it outputs 'B'. The input values `t` and the strings remain unchanged.**
