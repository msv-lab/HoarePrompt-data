Let's analyze the loop and the variables involved:

- `n` and `k` are given positive integers with `n >= k`.
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the `costs` list. For each iteration:
1. `curr` is calculated as `n // i`, which is the integer division of `n` by `i`.
2. `h` is incremented by `curr`.
3. `n` is decremented by `i * curr`.

Let's break down the iterations:

1. **First Iteration (i = n - k + 1):**
   - `curr = n // (n - k + 1)`
   - `h += curr`
   - `n -= (n - k + 1) * curr`

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - `curr = n // 1` which is just `n`
   - `h += n`
   - `n -= 1 * n` which results in `n = 0`

After the loop, `n` will be 0, and `h` will have accumulated the sum of the quotients from the divisions performed in each iteration.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is 0, k is unchanged, costs is unchanged, h is the sum of the quotients from the divisions performed in each iteration.**
