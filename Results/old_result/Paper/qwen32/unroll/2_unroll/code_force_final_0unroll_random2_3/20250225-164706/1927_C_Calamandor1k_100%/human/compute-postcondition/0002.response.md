Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in the list 'cases' is a tuple containing three elements: (n, m, k) where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m); the next two elements in each test case are lists 'a' and 'b' of lengths n and m respectively, where each element in 'a' and 'b' is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in 'cases' based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
