Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by a grasshopper moving from the top-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (2, n) in a 2 x n grid, and also count the number of paths that yield this string.

### Key Points:
1. **Movement:** The grasshopper can only move right or downwards.
2. **Lexicographically Smallest String:** This means the string formed by the path should be the smallest possible when compared lexicographically.
3. **Count Paths:** We need to count how many different paths can produce this smallest string.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not seem to correctly address the problem requirements. Let's break down the issues:
1. **Path Selection Logic:**
   - The program attempts to find a point `x` where it switches from the top row to the bottom row, and a point `y` where it could switch if the top row has a '0' and the bottom row has a '1' at that point.
   - However, this logic does not guarantee that the resulting string `s` will be the lexicographically smallest possible string.
   
2. **String Construction:**
   - The string `s` is constructed based on the first occurrence where the top row has a '1' and the bottom row has a '0'. This is not a general approach to finding the lexicographically smallest string.

3. **Path Counting:**
   - The program counts the number of paths based on a condition that does not necessarily reflect the number of ways to form the smallest string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem:
1. **Dynamic Programming:** Use dynamic programming to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of ways to achieve it.
2. **Path Tracking:** Track the paths that lead to the smallest string by maintaining a count of paths that form the same string up to each cell.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to guarantee the lexicographically smallest string and does not correctly count the number of paths that yield this string.

**Correctness:** **False**
