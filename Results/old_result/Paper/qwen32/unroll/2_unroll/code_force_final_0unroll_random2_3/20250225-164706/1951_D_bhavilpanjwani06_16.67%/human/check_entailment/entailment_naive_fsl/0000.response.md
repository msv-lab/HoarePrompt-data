Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to provide a valid configuration of stall prices that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels for many valid inputs.

Let's consider a few test cases to demonstrate the issue:

1. **Test Case:**
   ```
   Input:
   1
   10 5
   
   Expected Output:
   YES
   5
   2 2 2 2 2
   ```
   The program should output "YES" and provide a valid configuration of stall prices such that Alice buys exactly 5 jewels. However, the program outputs "NO" for this input, which is incorrect.

2. **Test Case:**
   ```
   Input:
   1
   100 10
   
   Expected Output:
   YES
   10
   10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
   ```
   The program should output "YES" and provide a valid configuration of stall prices such that Alice buys exactly 10 jewels. However, the program outputs "NO" for this input, which is incorrect.

3. **Test Case:**
   ```
   Input:
   1
   255 8
   
   Expected Output:
   YES
   8
   128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
   ```
   The program should output "YES" and provide a valid configuration of stall prices such that Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. However, the program outputs "NO" for this input, which is incorrect.

The program's logic is flawed and does not correctly determine when it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, the conditions in the program are not sufficient to handle all cases where it is possible to achieve the desired outcome.

To fix the program, a more comprehensive approach is needed to determine the stall prices dynamically based on the values of `n` and `k`. The current implementation only checks a few specific cases and does not provide a general solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
