The code snippet provided updates the `rows` variable by reading `n` lines of input, where each line contains `m` integers. The `rows` variable is reassigned to be a 2D list of integers constructed from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist (row) contains `m` integers read from the input, and `costs` is a list of integers representing the cost of installing supports for each row.**
