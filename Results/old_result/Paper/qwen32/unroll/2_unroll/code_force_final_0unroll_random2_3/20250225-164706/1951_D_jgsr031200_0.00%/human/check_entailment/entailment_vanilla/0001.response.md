Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
Bob wants to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice, who has `n` coins, buys exactly `k` jewels. Each stall has a price per jewel, and Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall in order.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` (coins) and `k` (jewels). It then calls `func_1(n, k)` to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls.

#### Inside `func_1(n, k)`:
1. **Immediate Checks**:
   - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying one jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin each. The program correctly outputs "YES" and sets up one stall with price 1.
   - If `n < k`, it's impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels since she doesn't have enough coins. The program correctly outputs "NO".

2. **Stall Pricing Logic**:
   - The program initializes a list `costs` with two prices: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these prices, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and subtracting the cost from `n`.
   - It checks if the total number of jewels bought is less than `k`. If so, it outputs "NO".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "YES" and the prices in `costs`.

### Issues:
- **Logic Flaw**: The program only considers two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`) and checks if these can make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels. This approach is too simplistic and does not guarantee a solution for all cases.
- **Stall Limit**: The program does not ensure that it uses at most 60 stalls, which is a requirement.
- **General Case Handling**: The program does not handle the general case where more than two stalls might be needed to achieve exactly `k` jewels bought.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible method is to use binary search to find the appropriate prices for the stalls. The idea is to use a combination of prices that sum up to `n` and allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is incorrect for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
