Output State: **The function takes no arguments but reads from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. `t` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input.**

In simple terms, `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The other details about the input structure remain the same.
