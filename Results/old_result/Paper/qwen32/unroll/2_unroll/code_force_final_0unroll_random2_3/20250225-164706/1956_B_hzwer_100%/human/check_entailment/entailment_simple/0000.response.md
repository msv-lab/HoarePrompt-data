### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine if it is correct.

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points you can get in a card game where each player receives `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards, with each integer from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice. You and Nene take turns, and you score a point if the card you play has already been played by either player. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The strategy to solve this problem is as follows:
1. Count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
2. For each card that appears more than once in your hand, you can score a point because you will be able to play the same card twice, and the second time it will already be on the table.
3. Sum up the points you can score based on the above logic.

The provided program does exactly this:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
3. It initializes a count array `cnt` to count the occurrences of each card.
4. It iterates through the list `a` and updates the count for each card.
5. It calculates the points you can score by summing up `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for each card `x`. This means you can score a point for each card that appears more than once in your hand.
6. It prints the result for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score, assuming that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The given program does not need to simulate the entire game, as the optimal strategy for both players can be deduced from the initial distribution of cards.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get based on the given problem description and the optimal strategies of both players.

Correctness: **True**
