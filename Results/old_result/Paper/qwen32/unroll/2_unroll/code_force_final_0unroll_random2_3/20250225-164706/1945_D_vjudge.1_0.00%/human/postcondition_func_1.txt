The function `func_2` reads an integer `numero_testes` from the input, which represents the number of tests to be performed. It then calls `func_1` exactly `numero_testes` times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The state of the program after it concludes is that `func_1` has been executed the specified number of times, but the specific effects of these calls on the program's state are not detailed in the provided code.
