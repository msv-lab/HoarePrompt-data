### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, taking into account the annotations.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis:
The code provided is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes `suma` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\) (which should be \(m\)) and calculates \(x\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
- If \(a - i(i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
- Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because:
- The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` should iterate over \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- The calculation of `x` and the condition `if a - i * (i - 1) > 0` do not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Evaluation:
Let's verify the logic of the program against the problem statement.

The provided code does not correctly implement the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` is iterating over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\). This \(i\) is not defined in the problem statement and doesn't correspond to either \(a\) or \(b\).
   - The correct approach would be to have nested loops: `for a in range(1, n + 1):` and `for b in range(1, m + 1):`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if int((j + i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j))) == 0:` is missing in the provided code. Instead, the code uses a complex formula that does not relate to the problem's condition.

3. **Formula**:
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent checks do not logically align with the problem's requirement to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the above points, the original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
