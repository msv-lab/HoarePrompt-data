You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then processes each string to determine if it can be rearranged to form a different string. If the string can be rearranged, it prints 'Yes' followed by one possible rearrangement; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the use of `random.sample` does not guarantee that the rearranged string `s2` will always be different from the original string `s`. Although the code includes a fallback mechanism to swap the first and second characters if `s2` ends up being the same as `s`, this fallback mechanism is not always sufficient to ensure that `s2` is a valid rearrangement.

Here is a specific case where the program might fail:

**Input:**
```
1
aab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
aba  # or "baa"
```

**Potential Incorrect Output:**
```
YES
aab  # This is the same as the input string, which is incorrect.
```

In this case, `random.sample(s, len(s))` might return the same permutation as the original string, and the fallback mechanism `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` does not guarantee a valid rearrangement for all possible inputs. For instance, if the original string is "aab" and `random.sample` returns "aab" again, the fallback mechanism will produce "aba", which is correct, but this is not guaranteed for all inputs.

To ensure correctness, a more reliable method of generating a different permutation should be used. For example, a systematic approach to swap characters or use a different permutation method that guarantees a different string could be implemented.
