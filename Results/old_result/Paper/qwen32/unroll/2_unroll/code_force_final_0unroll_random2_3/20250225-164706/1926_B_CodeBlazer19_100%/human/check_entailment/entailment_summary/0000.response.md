Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the problem description. The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' to determine if it's a triangle and if any row contains more than one '1' to determine if it's a square. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square as defined in the problem statement.

For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow a specific pattern: the i-th row should have 2*i-1 '1's, and these '1's should be centered in the grid. For an upside-down triangle, the pattern is similar but reversed. For a square, each row should have the same number of '1's, and these '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The current program does not check for these specific patterns and instead makes a simplistic check based on the count of '1's in each row, which is not sufficient to determine the shape accurately.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
