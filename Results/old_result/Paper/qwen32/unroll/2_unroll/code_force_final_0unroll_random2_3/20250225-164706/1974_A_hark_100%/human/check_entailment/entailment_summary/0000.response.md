### Reasoning:

The provided program calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid. The program processes each test case individually and outputs the correct number of screens for each case.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 applications, respectively.

2. **Calculation for Each Test Case:**
   - **Case 1:** When both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
     - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 applications first. Each 2x2 application occupies 4 cells, and since the grid is 5x3 (15 cells), it calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 applications and adjusts the remaining cells for 1x1 applications.
     - It then calculates the remaining cells that need to be filled by 1x1 applications and computes the number of additional screens required.
   - **Case 2:** When `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
     - Only 2x2 applications are present, so the program calculates the number of screens needed based on the number of 2x2 applications.
   - **Case 3:** When `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.
     - Only 1x1 applications are present, so the program calculates the number of screens needed based on the number of 1x1 applications.
   - **Case 4:** When both `x` and `y` are 0.
     - No applications are present, so no screens are needed.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly.
- The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 applications and adjusting for 1x1 applications appears to be correct.
- The use of `math.ceil` ensures that any fractional screens required are rounded up to the next whole number, which is appropriate.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summary. It correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for various combinations of 1x1 and 2x2 applications.

Correctness: **True**
