You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to divide the given list of integers into the minimum number of groups such that for any two integers in the same group, their binary representations do not share any matching bits in the least significant 31 bits. 

### Key Observations

1. **Bitwise XOR with Check**: The check value is `2**31 - 1`, which is a binary number with all 31 least significant bits set to 1. XORing any number `i` with this check value flips all the bits of `i` in the least significant 31 bits. This operation is used to find a complementary number that, when paired with `i`, would not have any matching bits in the least significant 31 bits.

2. **Dictionary for Counting**: The dictionary `dic` is used to keep track of the number of times each number (or its complement) appears. This helps in determining if an integer can be paired with another integer that has already been processed.

3. **Counting Groups**: The variable `ans` is initialized to the total number of integers `n`. As we process each integer, if we find a complement that has already been seen (i.e., `s` in the dictionary), we decrement `ans` because these two integers can be placed in the same group. If no complement is found, the integer is added to the dictionary.

4. **Output**: The program is supposed to print the minimum number of groups required after processing all integers in each test case.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Use of `check` Variable**: The `check` variable is re-initialized inside the loop for each test case, which is unnecessary and doesn't affect the outcome but is redundant. However, the more critical issue is that the `check` variable is used to flip all 31 bits, which is not the intended purpose. The purpose is to find a complementary number that can be paired with the current number, not to flip all bits.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Pairing**: The logic for pairing numbers is flawed. The XOR operation with `check` does not guarantee that the resulting number will be a valid complement for the purpose of the problem. Instead, the program should check if the current number's binary representation can be paired with any previously seen number's binary representation without matching bits in the least significant 31 bits.

3. **Printing the Answer**: The program prints the answer after processing each integer, which is incorrect. The answer should be printed only once after all integers in the current test case have been processed.

### Correctness of the Program

Given the issues identified, the provided program is not correct. It does not implement the correct logic for finding the minimum number of groups based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
