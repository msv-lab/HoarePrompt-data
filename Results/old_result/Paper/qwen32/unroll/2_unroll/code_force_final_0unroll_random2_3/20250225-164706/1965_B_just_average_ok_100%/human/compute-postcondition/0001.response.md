To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, the values of `n` and `k` are read.
2. **Initialization**: A list `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
3. **Finding the Index**: The code finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
4. **Modifying the List**:
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.
   - It removes the element `nums[idx]` from the list.
5. **Output**: The length of the modified list and the elements of the list are printed.

Since the state of `t` (the number of test cases) does not change during the loop, and `n` and `k` are only relevant for the current test case, the output state will be a series of outputs for each test case.

The output state for each test case will be:
- The length of the modified list `nums`.
- The elements of the modified list `nums`.

The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` are only relevant during the execution of each test case.

Output State: **For each test case, the length of the modified list `nums` followed by the elements of the modified list `nums`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.**
