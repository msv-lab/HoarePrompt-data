Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, where `h` and `w` are the dimensions of a grid, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are distinct coordinates on the grid. The function returns the result of some computation for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not detailed in the provided information.**
