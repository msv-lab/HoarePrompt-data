The only variable in the loop head is `nalla`, which is the loop variable, and `t`, which is the range limit. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate values from 0 to `t-1`. 

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is the integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `nalla` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted further because `t` is already constrained to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is the integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
