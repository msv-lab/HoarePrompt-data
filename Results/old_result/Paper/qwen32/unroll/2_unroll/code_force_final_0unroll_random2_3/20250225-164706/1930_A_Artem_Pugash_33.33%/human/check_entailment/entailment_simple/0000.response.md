### Reasoning:
The program's objective is to maximize the final score by performing a series of moves where, in each move, two integers are selected from a list, the smaller of the two is added to the score, and both integers are removed from the list. This process is repeated exactly `n` times, where `n` is half the number of integers in the list.

The program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum score by sorting the list of integers in non-decreasing order. By doing so, the smallest integers are paired together, ensuring that the smaller integer in each pair is always added to the score. This is because, after sorting, the smallest integers are at the beginning of the list, and by popping the first two elements in each iteration, we are effectively pairing the smallest available integers.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program iterates `n` times, each time popping the first two elements from the sorted list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and repeating until all integers are processed.
4. **Output**: The final score for each test case is printed.

The provided execution states in the comments suggest that the program produces the correct output for the given examples. The logic of sorting the list and pairing the smallest integers together is sound and aligns with the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum score as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
