The code snippet initializes the variable `max_profit` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_profit` is now 0, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is min(n, b); `max_profit` is 0.**
