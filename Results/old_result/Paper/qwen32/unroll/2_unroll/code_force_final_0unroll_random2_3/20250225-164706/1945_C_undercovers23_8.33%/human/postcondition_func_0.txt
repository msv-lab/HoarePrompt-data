The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` made up of '0's and '1's. It determines and prints the optimal split position for each test case, where the split ensures that at least 50% of the residents on each side of the split want to live on that side. If no such split exists, it returns either the start or end position based on the majority preference.
