### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the number of digits in a list of integers, adjusted by the number of trailing zeros of every second element when sorted in descending order. The game ends when only one number remains in the list, and Sasha wins if this number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

Let's break down the logic of the provided code:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) (number of integers) and \(m\) (parameter determining Sasha's win condition).
   - It then reads the list of integers, `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sum of Digits Calculation**: `tot` is calculated as the sum of the number of digits in all integers in `nums`.
   - **Counting Trailing Zeros**: For each integer in `nums`, the function `zerocnts` is called to count the number of trailing zeros.
   - **Adjusting `tot`**: The trailing zeros of every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros (`cntvals`) are subtracted from `tot`.
   - **Decision Making**: If `tot` is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - This function takes an integer, converts it to a string, and counts the number of trailing zeros.

The key to the problem is understanding that Sasha and Anna's optimal moves can be abstracted into the total number of digits minus the trailing zeros of every second element when sorted in descending order. This is because Sasha can always concatenate numbers in a way that maximizes the number of digits, while Anna can only reverse numbers, potentially removing trailing zeros.

The provided code correctly implements this logic. It calculates the total number of digits and adjusts for the trailing zeros of every second element, then makes a decision based on the adjusted sum.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the logic explained.

**Correctness: True**
