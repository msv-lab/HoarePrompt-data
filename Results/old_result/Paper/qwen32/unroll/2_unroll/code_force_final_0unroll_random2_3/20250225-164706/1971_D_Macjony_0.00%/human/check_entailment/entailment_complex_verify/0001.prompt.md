You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1

        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1

        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: a sequence of `t` numbers, each representing the count of segments for the corresponding input string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It then calculates and prints the number of segments in the string, where a segment is defined as a contiguous sequence of the same character. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string, it subtracts one from the segment count before printing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum number of pieces you need to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. If the string is already sorted (all '0's before all '1's), only one piece is needed.
2. Every time we encounter a transition from '0' to '1', it suggests a potential cut point because we might need to separate these segments to sort them.
3. However, if the string starts with '1's and ends with '0's, the final piece of '0's can be merged with the preceding piece of '1's after rearrangement, hence reducing the count by one.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
3. It initializes `count` to 1, assuming at least one piece is needed.
4. It also initializes `flag` to `False` to track if there's at least one '0' followed by a '1'.
5. It iterates through the string, checking adjacent characters:
   - If `s[j]` is different from `s[j+1]`, it increments `count` (indicating a potential cut).
   - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.
6. After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1, accounting for the possibility of merging the last piece of '0's with the preceding piece of '1's.
7. It prints the final `count` for each test case.

### Testing the Program

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   6
   11010
   00000000
   1
   10
   0001111
   0110
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   3
   1
   1
   2
   1
   2
   ```

   - **Test Case 1:** "11010"
     - Transitions: 1->0, 0->1, 1->0
     - `count` = 4, but `flag` is `True`, so `count` becomes 3.
   - **Test Case 2:** "00000000"
     - No transitions, `count` = 1.
   - **Test Case 3:** "1"
     - No transitions, `count` = 1.
   - **Test Case 4:** "10"
     - Transition: 1->0, `count` = 2, `flag` is `True`, but `count` remains 2 (since it's already minimal).
   - **Test Case 5:** "0001111"
     - No transitions after the initial '0's, `count` = 1.
   - **Test Case 6:** "0110"
     - Transitions: 0->1, 1->0, `count` = 3, `flag` is `True`, so `count` becomes 2.

The program correctly handles these test cases.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
