Output State: **path is the last path string processed, n is the last integer representing the number of signs processed, data remains the same, t remains the same, index is 1 + 2 * t, results is a list of results from func_1(path) for each iteration.**

The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each `result`. This action does not change the values of `path`, `n`, `data`, `t`, or `index`. The `results` list itself remains unchanged as well, as the loop only reads from it and does not modify it. Therefore, the state after the loop completes is the same as the initial state, except that the results have been printed.
