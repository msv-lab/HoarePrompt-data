Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Product**: The program does not correctly calculate the product of the array elements as commands are processed. Instead, it first constructs a list `b` of elements in the order they are removed, and then calculates the cumulative product of this list in reverse order. This does not match the problem's requirement of calculating the product of the current state of the array `a` at the beginning of each command.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The program does not take the modulo `m` of the product at each step. The problem requires that the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` is taken modulo `m` at each step before any element is removed.

3. **Reversing the Result**: The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which is incorrect. The problem requires the remainders in the order they are calculated, not in reverse order.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
- Calculate the initial product of all elements in the array `a` and take the modulo `m`.
- For each command, output the current product modulo `m`, then remove the appropriate element ('L' for leftmost, 'R' for rightmost) and update the product accordingly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
