### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by using a sliding window approach combined with the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to efficiently count the occurrences of elements in the subarrays of `a`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Counting**:
   - It creates a `Counter` for the first `m` elements of `a` (`cnt_aa`) and a `Counter` for all elements of `b` (`cnt_bb`).
   - It calculates the intersection of these two counters (`D`), which represents the common elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and all elements of `b`.
   - It calculates the number of matching pairs in `D` (`pairs_in_D`).
   - It also calculates the differences `E` (elements in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`) and `C` (elements in `cnt_bb` but not in `D`).

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - It initializes a counter `fnd` to keep track of the number of good subarrays.
   - For each subsequent subarray, it slides the window by one element to the right:
     - It removes the element that is sliding out of the window (`out_aa`) and adjusts the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
     - It adds the element that is sliding into the window (`in_aa`) and adjusts the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
     - It checks if the number of matching pairs (`pairs_in_D`) is at least `k` and increments `fnd` if true.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all subarrays for a test case, it prints the count of good subarrays.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly initializes the counters and calculates the initial number of matching pairs.
  - The sliding window mechanism ensures that the program efficiently updates the counters as the window slides, which is crucial given the problem constraints.
  - The logic for adjusting the counters when elements enter and leave the window is sound.
  - The program correctly checks the condition for each subarray and counts the number of good subarrays.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `k` is 1 or `k` is equal to `m` correctly.
  - It also handles cases where there are no matching elements between `a` and `b` correctly.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. 

**Correctness: True**
