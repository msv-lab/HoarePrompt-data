### Reasoning:

The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness of each function:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Input Parsing**: The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`. These lists represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue, respectively.
    - **Reversing Lists**: Both `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This reversal is crucial for the logic that follows.
    - **Accumulating Costs**:
        - `soma_b` is initialized to 0. This variable accumulates the sum of `b_i` values.
        - `pref` is also initialized to 0. This variable accumulates the sum of `soma_b` plus `a_i` when `a_i < b_i`.
        - The loop iterates through the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists. For each index `i`:
            - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it means it's cheaper to swap with the person at position `i` directly, so `pref` is updated to include the accumulated `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, and `soma_b` is reset to 0.
            - If `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]`, it means it's cheaper to pay the `b_i` cost to move past this person, so `soma_b` is incremented by `lista_B[i]`.
    - **Finding the Minimum Cost**:
        - `resultado` is initialized to infinity. This variable will store the minimum cost found.
        - The loop iterates through the remaining elements of the reversed lists (from index `n - k` to `n - 1`). For each index `i`:
            - The cost for Kirill to reach position `i` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. This is compared with the current `resultado` to find the minimum.
            - `soma_b` is incremented by `lista_B[i]` to include the cost of moving past this person.
    - **Output**: The function prints the minimum cost found.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Reading Test Cases**: The function reads an integer `numero_testes` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
    - **Processing Each Test Case**: The function calls `func_1` exactly `numero_testes` times. Each call to `func_1` processes one test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Logic Consistency**: The logic in `func_1` correctly accumulates the costs based on the problem's constraints. The reversal of the lists and the specific logic to accumulate `pref` and `soma_b` ensures that the minimum cost is calculated efficiently.
- **Edge Cases**: The algorithm handles edge cases such as when `n = m` (Kirill can be at the end of the line) and when all `a_i` values are smaller than `b_i` values (direct swaps are always cheaper).
- **Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints (sum of `n` over all test cases is â‰¤ 2 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
