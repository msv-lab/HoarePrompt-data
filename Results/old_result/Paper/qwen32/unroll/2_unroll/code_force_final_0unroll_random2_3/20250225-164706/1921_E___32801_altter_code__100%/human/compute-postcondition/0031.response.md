Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^6, `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 10^9, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; additionally, `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` if `y2` > `y1` or `r[3] - 1` if `y2` <= `y1`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1` >= `y2` otherwise `m - y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, and either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`**
