You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the price of an item for Alice and Bob respectively. secondary_heap is a list of tuples with the same structure as primary_items, representing items that have been placed in a secondary heap (likely for processing).
def func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap):
    total = sum(item[0] for item in secondary_heap)
    for item in primary_items:
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            total += item[0] + item[1]
        
    #State: `primary_items` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the price of an item for Alice and Bob respectively; `secondary_heap` is a list of tuples with the same structure as `primary_items`, representing items that have been placed in a secondary heap; `total` is the sum of the first elements of each tuple in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the sums of the two integers in each tuple of `primary_items` where the sum of the two integers is non-negative.`
    return total
    #The program returns the total, which is the sum of the first elements of each tuple in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the sums of the two integers in each tuple of `primary_items` where the sum of the two integers is non-negative.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`. `primary_items` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices of an item for Alice and Bob respectively. `secondary_heap` is a list of tuples with the same structure. The function calculates the total, which is the sum of the first elements of each tuple in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the sums of the two integers in each tuple of `primary_items` where the sum of the two integers is non-negative. The function returns this total.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total, which is the sum of the first elements of each tuple in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the sums of the two integers in each tuple of `primary_items` where the sum of the two integers is non-negative.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
