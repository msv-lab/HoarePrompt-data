### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Calculating the Sum of the Array:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the array `s = sum(a)`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - The program uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum `t`. This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum `tmp`, resetting `tmp` to 0 if it becomes negative, and updating `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`.

4. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The initial result `ans` is set to `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the program doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to `ans`, taking the result modulo `MOD` after each addition.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final result `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. Here's why:

- **Sum of the Array (`s`):** The sum `s` is correctly calculated as the sum of all elements in the array.
- **Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`):** The maximum subarray sum is correctly calculated using Kadane's algorithm, which is optimal for this purpose.
- **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum:** The program correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for each of the `k-1` operations and adds it to the result `ans`. This is based on the observation that the optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum subarray sum to the array.
- **Modulo Operation:** The program correctly uses the modulo operation to ensure that the result does not exceed the limit `10^9 + 7`.

Given that the program correctly implements the required logic and handles the constraints, the output for each test case will be correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
