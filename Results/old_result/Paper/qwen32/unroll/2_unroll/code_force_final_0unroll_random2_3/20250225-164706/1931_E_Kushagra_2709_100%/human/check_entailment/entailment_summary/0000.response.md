### Reasoning:

The problem involves a game where Anna and Sasha take turns manipulating a list of integers. The game ends when only one integer remains, and the winner is determined based on the value of this integer and a given threshold `m`.

- **Anna's Move**: She reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing any leading zeros.
- **Sasha's Move**: He concatenates two chosen numbers and inserts the result back into the list, reducing the number of elements by one.

The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, i.e., when there is only one number left. Sasha wins if this number is at least `10^m`; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Analysis of the Provided Functions:

1. **Function `zerocnts(num)`**:
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of a number.
   - It correctly implements the logic for counting trailing zeros, which is used to adjust the total length of numbers in the list.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of digits in all numbers in the list.
   - It then sorts the list of numbers based on the number of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It subtracts the number of trailing zeros of every second element from the total digit count.
   - The logic here is based on the assumption that Sasha can always concatenate numbers in a way that minimizes the impact of Anna's moves (reversing numbers), and Anna can always reverse numbers to maximize her chances of winning.
   - The function returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted total number of digits is at least `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

### Correctness of the Program:

The program seems to rely on a strategy that assumes optimal play from both players. The key point is that Sasha can always concatenate numbers in a way that minimizes the impact of Anna's moves, and Anna can always reverse numbers to maximize her chances of winning. The function `func_1` appears to be implementing a heuristic based on the number of trailing zeros to determine the winner.

However, the provided solution does not take into account the exact concatenation strategy that Sasha might use or the exact reversal strategy that Anna might use. It simplifies the game by focusing on the number of trailing zeros, which might not always be sufficient to determine the winner accurately.

Given the complexity of the game, the provided solution might not cover all edge cases and might not always determine the winner correctly. For example, if Anna reverses a number with many trailing zeros, it could significantly change the game's outcome in a way that the current heuristic does not account for.

### Conclusion:

While the provided solution might work for some test cases, it does not guarantee the correct result for all possible scenarios due to its simplified heuristic approach. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided functions and logic is questionable.

**Correctness: False**
