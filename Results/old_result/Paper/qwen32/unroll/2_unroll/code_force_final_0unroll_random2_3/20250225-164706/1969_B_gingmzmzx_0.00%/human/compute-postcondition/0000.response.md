The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that `n` will take on the value of the integer input, but the initial state of `t` and the binary strings `s` for each test case remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `n` is an input integer.**
