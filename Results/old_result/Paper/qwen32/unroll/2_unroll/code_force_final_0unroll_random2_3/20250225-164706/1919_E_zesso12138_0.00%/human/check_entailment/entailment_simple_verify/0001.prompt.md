You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Given a sorted prefix sum array `p` derived from an array `a` consisting of 1s and -1s, determine the number of possible initial arrays `a` that could result in the given `p`.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The prefix sum array `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The array `a` is of size `n` and consists only of 1s and -1s.
   - The prefix sum `p_i` is defined as `p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i`.
   - The number of possible arrays `a` should be computed modulo `998,244,353`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the prefix sum array `p` from an array `a`.
   - **State Representation**: `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum of `j - offset` after processing some elements of `a`.
   - **Initialization**: `dp[offset] = 1` initializes the starting point (prefix sum 0).
   - **Transition**: For each element in `a`, the program updates the `dp` array by considering the addition or subtraction of 1 to the current prefix sum.
   - **Final State**: The final result is obtained from `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` adjusted by `offset`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Handling**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute the number of possible arrays `a` and stores the result.
   - **Output**: Prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is appropriate for counting the possible ways to reach each prefix sum, considering the constraints.
- The use of `offset` ensures that the prefix sums are handled within a valid range.
- The modulo operation (`% MOD`) ensures that the results are computed within the required range.
- The overall structure of the program correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently counts the number of possible initial arrays `a` that could result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

**Correctness: True**
