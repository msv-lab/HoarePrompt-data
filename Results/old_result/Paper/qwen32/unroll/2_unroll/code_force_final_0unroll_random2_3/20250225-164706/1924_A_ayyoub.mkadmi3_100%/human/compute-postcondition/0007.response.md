Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n`. It returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating if the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s` itself.**
