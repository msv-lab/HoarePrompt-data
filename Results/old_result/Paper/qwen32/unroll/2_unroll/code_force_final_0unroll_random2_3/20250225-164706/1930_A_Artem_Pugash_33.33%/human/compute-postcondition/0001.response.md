The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `numCases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `numCases`. If `numCases` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` are given, but these do not directly affect whether the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `numCases` is greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and there are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
