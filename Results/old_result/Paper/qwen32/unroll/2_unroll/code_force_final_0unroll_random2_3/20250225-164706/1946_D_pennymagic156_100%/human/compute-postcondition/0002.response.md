Output State: **`n` and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, the length of the array `a` is still a positive integer, and each integer in `a` is still less than 2^30, but `a` now holds the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, and `ans` is -1.**

In natural language: The variables `n` and `x` have been assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. The array `a` has been updated to hold the value returned by `func_1()`, and it is still a list of positive integers where each integer is less than 2^30. The variable `t` is now an empty list, and `ans` is -1.
