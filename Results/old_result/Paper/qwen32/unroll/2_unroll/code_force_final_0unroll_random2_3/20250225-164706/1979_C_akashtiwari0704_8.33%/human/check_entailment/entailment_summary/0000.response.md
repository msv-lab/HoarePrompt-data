Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine a way to distribute bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The logic used in the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`). This product represents the total amount that would need to be distributed if each multiplier was used once in a fraction of the total bet.

2. **Bet Distribution**: For each multiplier `k_i`, the program computes the corresponding bet as `prod // k_i`. This is based on the idea that if the product of all multipliers is the total "share" of the bet, then each bet should be a fraction of this total, inversely proportional to the multiplier.

3. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of these computed bets (`sumo`) is less than the product (`prod`). If the sum is not less, it means the distribution does not satisfy the condition of coming out ahead in any winning scenario, and the program outputs `-1`.

4. **Output**: If the sum of the bets is less than the product, the program outputs the computed bets.

However, there is a logical flaw in the approach. The condition `sumo < prod` is not guaranteed to ensure that the total bet is less than the payout for each winning outcome. The logic should instead ensure that for each outcome, the total bet is less than the payout for that particular outcome. The correct approach would involve solving a system of inequalities, which the current program does not do.

For example, in the case where all multipliers are the same (like in the third test case of the example input), the product will be much larger than the sum of the computed bets, leading to an incorrect `-1` output when a valid distribution exists.

Correctness: **False**
