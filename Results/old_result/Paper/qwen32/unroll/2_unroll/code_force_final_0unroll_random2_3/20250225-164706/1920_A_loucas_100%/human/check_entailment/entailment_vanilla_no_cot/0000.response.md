Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Specifically, the line `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1` does not correctly account for the constraints of type 3 (not equal to some integer `x`).

Here's why the program is incorrect:

- The program calculates the potential range of `k` by subtracting the maximum value from the minimum value of the constraints of types 1 and 2, respectively. This is correct in identifying the range of possible `k` values.
- However, the program then subtracts 1 for each value in the `no` list (constraints of type 3) that falls within this range. This approach is flawed because it doesn't consider the possibility that multiple constraints of type 3 might refer to the same value within the range, and it doesn't handle the case where a constraint of type 3 is outside the calculated range.

To fix the program, you should:

1. Determine the valid range of `k` using the minimum value from constraints of type 1 and the maximum value from constraints of type 2.
2. Create a set of values that are not allowed (from constraints of type 3).
3. Count the number of integers within the valid range that are not in the set of disallowed values.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        min_val = max(big)
        max_val = min(less)
        if min_val > max_val:
            print(0)
            continue
        count = max_val - min_val + 1 - len(no.intersection(range(min_val, max_val + 1)))
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
