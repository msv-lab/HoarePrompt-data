Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged as they are described in the initial state.
