#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: results is a list of 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions for each test case.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: results is a list of 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions for each test case, and each element of the list has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their orientations ("U" for up, "D" for down). For each test case, it checks if the number of coins is odd and if there are more coins facing up than down. If both conditions are met, it outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".
