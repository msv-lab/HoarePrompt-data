### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether it correctly implements the logic to decide who will win the game based on the provided problem description.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - This part of the code is correctly implemented in `func_1`.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The key insight in the problem is that the game's outcome can be determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins.
   - This is because each move flips an even number of coins (either 2 or 0, depending on the number of coins left), so the parity of the number of facing-up coins remains the same after each move.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function reads the input and stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in the list `cases`. This is correctly implemented.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function takes a test case `(n, s)`, counts the number of `'U'` in the string `s`, and returns `'YES'` if the count is odd and `'NO'` if it is even. This is also correctly implemented according to the function summary provided.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic used in `func_2` is correct based on the problem's analysis. The parity of the number of `'U'` determines the winner.
   - The input reading and processing in `func_1` are also correctly implemented to handle multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
