### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`. If not, it should provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

Let's analyze the program's logic and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences of `s`.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates over `s`, updating the alphabet set by removing characters that appear in `s1` (a string built as it iterates).
   - When the alphabet set is reduced to one character, it starts appending to `s2` and resets the alphabet set.
   - The function returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` from a calculated index.
     - The string `s2` which includes characters which were the last remaining in the set of allowed alphabets at any point during processing.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program calls `func_1` and checks the returned boolean.
   - If the boolean is `False`, it attempts to construct a string of length `n` that does not occur in `s` and appends it to the output.
   - If the boolean is `True`, it appends "YES" to the output.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Logic for Constructing the Missing String:**
  - The current logic for constructing the missing string is flawed. It simply appends the character not found in `s1` to the end of `s2` repeated `n - len(s2)` times. This does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.
  - The program does not ensure that the constructed string is the smallest lexicographical string that is missing.

- **Boolean Check:**
  - The boolean check `len(s1) >= n * k` is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. This check only ensures that `s1` contains enough characters to potentially form `n` strings of length `k`, but it does not guarantee that all combinations of those characters appear in `s`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, particularly in the logic for constructing the missing string and the boolean check, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
