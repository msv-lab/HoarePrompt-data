The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This value of `t` will be used to determine how many test cases will follow. The values of `n` and the list `a` are not affected by this input operation. The initial state specifies the constraints on `t`, `n`, and the elements of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case; and `a` is a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
