### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Overview:
We need to count the number of possible original arrays `a` of size `n` such that when we compute the prefix sums `p` of `a` and then sort `p`, we get the given sorted prefix sums array. The answer should be given modulo `998244353`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Prefix Sums and Sorting**:
   - Given an array `a` of size `n` consisting of `1` and `-1`, the prefix sum array `p` is defined as `p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i`.
   - The array `p` is then sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - We are given the sorted array `p` and need to determine the number of possible arrays `a`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sums.
   - A `dp` array is used where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach the prefix sum `j - offset` (where `offset` is used to handle negative indices).
   - The `dp` array is updated based on the transitions from `j` to `j + 1` and `j - 1` (since each element in `a` can be either `1` or `-1`).

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final result is obtained by checking the value of `dp` at the index corresponding to the last element of `p` plus the `offset`.
   - This value represents the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sums.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and stores the result.
   - It then prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis of the Code:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The dynamic programming approach is correctly implemented. It considers all possible transitions from one prefix sum to the next.
  - The use of `offset` is appropriate to handle negative indices in the `dp` array.
  - The final sum is correctly calculated as `p[-1] + offset` to determine the index in the `dp` array.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It calls `func_1` with the correct parameters and collects the results.
  - The results are printed in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sums array `p`. The code handles multiple test cases and outputs the results in the required format.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
