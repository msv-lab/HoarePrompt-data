### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, and for each array, it checks whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operations.

However, there are several issues with the logic of the program:

1. **Incorrect Iteration and Comparison:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the array to the beginning (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`). This means it starts comparing the last element with the second last element.
   - When it finds an element `arr[i]` that is smaller than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, it tries to split `arr[i - 1]` and check if the resulting list (including `arr[i]`) is sorted. If it is not, the program incorrectly concludes that it's not possible to sort the array.
   - However, this is not the correct approach. The program should be able to split any element (not just the one preceding the current smallest element) and check if the entire array can be sorted.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting:**
   - When an element is split, the program should be able to handle multiple splits and recursively check if the entire array can be sorted. The current implementation only checks if the immediate neighboring elements can be sorted after one split, which is insufficient.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Sorted Check:**
   - The program checks if the immediate neighboring elements (after one split) are sorted, but it does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted after multiple splits.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
