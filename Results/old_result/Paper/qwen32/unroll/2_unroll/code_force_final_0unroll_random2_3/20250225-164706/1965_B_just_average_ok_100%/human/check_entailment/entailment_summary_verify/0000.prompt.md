You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list of numbers based on the value of `k`, modifies this list by adding and removing specific elements, and then outputs the length of the modified list followed by its elements. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there is no subsequence of the sequence `a` that sums to `k`, while also ensuring that every other integer between 1 and `n` can be formed as a subsequence sum.

Let's consider a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
A sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold:
- There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `2`.
- For all `1 ≤ v ≤ 3` where `v ≠ 2`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

One valid solution could be:
```
2
1 3
```
Here, the subsequences are:
- Subsequence sum of `1`: `[1]`
- Subsequence sum of `3`: `[3]`
There is no subsequence that sums to `2`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program generates a sequence that does not guarantee the absence of a subsequence summing to `k`.

Let's see what the program outputs for this test case:
- The program generates a sequence based on powers of 2 up to `2^20`.
- It identifies the largest power of 2 less than `k` and adjusts the sequence to include `k` and other values, but it does not ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.

For `k = 2`, the program might generate a sequence like:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
Here, the subsequence `[2]` sums to `2`, which violates the condition that there should be no subsequence summing to `k`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
