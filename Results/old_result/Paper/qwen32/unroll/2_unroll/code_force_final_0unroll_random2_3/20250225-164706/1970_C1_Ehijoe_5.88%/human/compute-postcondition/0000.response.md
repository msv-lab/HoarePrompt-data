The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `t` is initially set to 1. The code will update `n` and `t` with the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node of the stone where 1 <= u_1 <= n.**
