Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It returns a value based on the number of tests, `numero_testes`, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. However, since the function definition does not list any parameters, the exact functionality in terms of input and output based on `numero_testes` cannot be determined from the provided information.**
