### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if a subarray of the given array `c` is "good" based on specific conditions. A subarray is considered "good" if:

1. The sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. Every element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Every element in `b` is greater than 0.

The program provided does not directly check these conditions. Instead, it checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. This condition is not equivalent to the conditions given in the problem.

Let's analyze the given program:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray `c[l_i:r_i]`.

2. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` using the prefix sum array `p`.

3. **Condition Check**: It then checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`). If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is not equivalent to the conditions for the subarray to be "good" as defined in the problem. Specifically:

- The program does not check if there exists another array `b` such that the sum of `b` is equal to the sum of the subarray and all elements of `b` are greater than 0 and different from the corresponding elements in the subarray.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the conditions for determining if a subarray is "good" as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
