To determine if the provided program is correct, let's analyze the problem requirements and the program's implementation.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Good Array Definition**:
   - A subarray is considered good if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in `a` (subarray) equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     - Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the sum of the subarray is `S`, then the sum of `b` must also be `S`.
   - For `a_i != b_i` and `b_i > 0` to hold, `b_i` can be chosen such that `b_i = a_i + 1` for each element. This ensures `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`.
   - For the subarray to be good, the sum `S` must be at least `2 * (length of subarray)`. This is because if `b_i = a_i + 1`, then `S_b = S_a + length of subarray`. For `S_a = S_b`, `S_a` must be at least `2 * (length of subarray)`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `l`, and the queries.
- It calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in `p`.
- For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums.
- It checks if the subarray can be good based on the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, where `s` is the sum of the subarray, and `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray.
- If the condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the problem's requirements. The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where all elements are positive and different from the corresponding elements in `a`.

Therefore, the program is correct.
