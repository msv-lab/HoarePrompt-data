Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. Here's why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads the input and stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` where `n` is the number of coins and `s` is the string representing the coins' states. This part of the code is correctly parsing the input as per the problem description.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function takes a test case and counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins. If the count of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The logic here is based on the observation that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of facing-up coins, and vice versa. This is a known strategy in such combinatorial games.

The program correctly handles all edge cases:
- If there are no facing-up coins, the function will return 'NO' (Bob wins).
- If there is only one facing-up coin, the function will return 'YES' (Alice wins).
- If there are multiple facing-up coins, the function correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the count of facing-up coins.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
