The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to select `k` distinct elements such that at most `k/2` elements are from list `a` and at most `k/2` elements are from list `b`. It returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether the condition is met for each test case.
