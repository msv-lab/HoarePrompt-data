The provided code snippet is:
```
a = []
```

This line of code initializes an empty list named `a`. No other variables are affected. The initial state mentions several variables (`n`, two binary strings, and the number of test cases `t`), but they remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is an empty list; Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the grid. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
