The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n == k` correctly by printing "YES" and then printing `1` and `1`. This is because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels at a price of `1` coin per jewel.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO". This is because if Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy, it is impossible for her to buy `k` jewels.

2. **General Case**:
   - For the general case where `n > k`, the program attempts to create a list of costs `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then tries to determine if Alice can buy `k` jewels with those prices.
   - The logic in the loop is flawed. The program calculates `curr` as `n // i` and then subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. However, the goal is to determine if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting prices such that she buys exactly `k` jewels, not to simply reduce `n` to `0`.
   - The program checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k` and prints "NO" if true. However, the way it calculates `h` and `costs` is not guaranteed to result in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Stall Setup**:
   - The problem requires setting up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program does not consider setting up multiple stalls with different prices to achieve this goal. Instead, it only considers two stalls, which is insufficient for most cases.

### Correctness

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
