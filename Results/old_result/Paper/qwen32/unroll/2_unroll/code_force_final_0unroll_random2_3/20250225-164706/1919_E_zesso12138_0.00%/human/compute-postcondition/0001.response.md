The code `data = input().split()` splits the entire input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means `data` will now hold a list of strings, each representing a part of the original input.

Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`. The `input` variable holds the entire input provided as a string.

After the code executes, `data` will be a list of strings, and the other variables (`n`, `p`, and `input`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`; `input` holds the entire input provided as a string; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace.**
