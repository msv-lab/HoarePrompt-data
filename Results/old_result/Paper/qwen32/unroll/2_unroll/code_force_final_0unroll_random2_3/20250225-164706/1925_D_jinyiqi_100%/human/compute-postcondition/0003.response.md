To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each set of inputs and generates its output.

### Loop Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from the input.
   - `sum_f` is initialized to 0. This variable will accumulate the sum of `f_i` for each pair `(a_i, b_i)`.

2. **Summing `f_i`**:
   - For each of the `m` lines, the values `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` are read.
   - `f_i` is added to `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating `cn2`**:
   - `cn2` is calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Calculating `p` and `q`**:
   - `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplifying the fraction**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` is calculated.
   - `p` and `q` are divided by their GCD to simplify the fraction.

6. **Modular Inverse**:
   - The modular inverse of `q` modulo `M` (which is 10) is calculated using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - The result is `p * (modular inverse of q) % M`.

7. **Output**:
   - The result of the above calculation is printed.

### Output State:

Since the loop runs `t` times, each iteration processes a different set of inputs and produces a different output. The final output state will be the sequence of outputs for each iteration.

Given the format requirement, the output state should describe the sequence of outputs for each iteration of the loop.

### Format:

Output State: **a sequence of outputs for each iteration, separated by spaces.**

### Example:

If the loop runs for `t = 2` with the following inputs:
- First iteration: `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`, pairs `(1, 2, 5)`, `(2, 3, 6)`.
- Second iteration: `n = 4`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, pair `(1, 2, 10)`.

The output for each iteration would be calculated as described, and the final output state would be:

Output State: **output1 output2**

Where `output1` and `output2` are the results of the first and second iterations, respectively.

Since the exact inputs are not provided, the output state in a general form would be:

Output State: **result1 result2 ... resultt**

Where `result1, result2, ..., resultt` are the outputs of each iteration of the loop.

If specific inputs were provided, we could calculate the exact outputs. Given the problem constraints and the loop structure, the output state after all iterations would be the sequence of results from each iteration.

Thus, the final output state format is:

Output State: **result1 result2 ... resultt**
