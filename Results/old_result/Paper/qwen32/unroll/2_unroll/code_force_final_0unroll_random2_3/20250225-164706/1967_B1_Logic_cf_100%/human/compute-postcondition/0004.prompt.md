You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After processing all test cases, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the final printed values of `ans` for each test case are the outputs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). It processes each test case and returns an output based on the values of `n` and `m`. The sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
