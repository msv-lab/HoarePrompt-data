The function `func_1` determines whether there is a cycle in a graph starting from a given node, excluding the path to its parent node. It returns `False` if the starting node is a leaf node (has only one neighbor, which is the parent) or if no cycles are detected in the subtree rooted at the starting node. It returns `True` if a cycle is detected in the subtree.
