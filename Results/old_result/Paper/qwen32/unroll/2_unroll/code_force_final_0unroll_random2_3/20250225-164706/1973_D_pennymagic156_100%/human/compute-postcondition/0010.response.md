Functionality: **The function `func_5` interacts with an external process by sending queries and receiving responses. It uses these interactions to determine a specific value `i * v` based on the conditions defined by the responses. If such a value is found, it outputs `! i * v`. If no such value is found after a series of queries, it outputs `! -1`. The function does not return any value (None).**
