To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the provided code snippet. The code processes `T` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on certain conditions and prints the result.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Loop through each test case (`T` times)**:
   - For each test case, read two integers `a` and `b`.
   
2. **Calculate the sum**:
   - Initialize `suma` to 0.
   - Loop through `i` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).
     - Calculate `x` as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
     - If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, add `x` to `suma`.
   - Print `suma - 1`.

The output of the code for each test case is the value of `suma - 1` after the inner loop completes.

**Output State**: The output state consists of `T` lines, each line containing the result of `suma - 1` for the respective test case. The state of other variables not involved in the loop body (like `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `suma`) will be in their post-loop state, but since they are not required to be part of the output state, we focus on the printed results.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical results. However, the format of the output will be `T` lines, each containing the result of `suma - 1` for each test case.

Therefore, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **T lines, each line containing the result of `suma - 1` for each test case.**
