You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of vertices `n`, a number of chosen vertices `x`, and a list of `x` distinct vertices. It calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the gaps between the chosen vertices and their positions relative to the total number of vertices.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a regular polygon (cake) with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices to form potential diagonals. The goal is to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using these `x` vertices and no additional vertices (`y = 0`).

### Key Points:
1. **Vertices and Diagonals:** Triangles are formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between chosen vertices.
2. **Constraints:** We cannot add any more vertices (`y = 0`), so we must use only the `x` vertices provided.
3. **Output:** The number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed.

### How Triangles are Formed:
A triangle can be formed if there are three consecutive vertices among the chosen vertices. For example, if vertices 1, 2, and 3 are chosen, they form a triangle. If vertices 1, 3, and 5 are chosen, no triangle is formed unless additional vertices are used, which is not allowed here.

### Approach:
1. **Sort the Chosen Vertices:** This helps in easily identifying consecutive vertices.
2. **Count Consecutive Vertices:** For each pair of consecutive vertices in the sorted list, check if there is exactly one vertex between them. If so, a triangle can be formed.
3. **Handle Circular Nature:** Also, check if the first and last chosen vertices form a triangle with the vertices in between them.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows the above approach:
1. **Input Reading:** Reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` vertices.
2. **Sorting:** Sorts the list of chosen vertices.
3. **Counting Triangles:**
   - Iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between consecutive vertices is exactly 1 (indicating a triangle can be formed).
   - Also checks if the difference between the last vertex and the first vertex (considering the circular nature of the polygon) is exactly 1.
4. **Output:** The count of triangles plus `x - 2` is printed. This is because each set of three consecutive vertices forms one triangle, and the formula `x - 2` gives the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed from `x` points on a circle.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with the given vertices. It handles the circular nature of the polygon and correctly calculates the number of triangles.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
