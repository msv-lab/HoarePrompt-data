Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing, the second part is non-decreasing, and the first element of the list is greater than or equal to all elements in the second part. It outputs 'YES' if such a split is possible, otherwise 'NO'.**
