Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the given cyclic shift operation. Let's analyze why:

The program calculates the cost based on the number of zeros and ones encountered. However, the logic does not correctly account for the cost of cyclically shifting substrings to sort the string. The cost is supposed to be the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted, and the program does not compute this cost accurately.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:

**Example:**
Input:
```
1
101011
```
Expected Output:
```
5
```
Explanation of the expected output:
- One optimal strategy is to choose substring [1, 3]: 101011 -> 011011 (cost = 3)
- Then choose substring [2, 4]: 011011 -> 001111 (cost = 3)
- Total cost = 3 + 2 = 5

However, the provided program will not produce this output. The program's logic does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifting and cost calculation as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the cost calculation correctly for all cases.
