Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
A password is considered strong if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. It consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit comes after a letter.
3. All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis

The program is structured as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.
3. It calls `func_1(password)` to check if the password is strong.
4. `func_1`:
   - Separates the digits and letters.
   - Sorts the digits and letters.
   - Checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - Checks if the last digit is not greater than any letter.
   - Constructs a sorted password from the digits and letters and compares it to the original password.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Digit and Letter Order Check**: The program checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, but it does not ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the original password. For example, the password "a1b" should be "NO" because '1' comes after 'a'.
2. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program constructs a sorted password and compares it to the original password. However, this approach does not correctly handle the requirement that no digit should come after a letter in the original password.

### Correctness
The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the requirement that no digit should come after a letter in the original password.

### Counterexample
Consider the password "a1b":
- The program will separate the digits and letters, sort them, and then check the conditions.
- It will find that the digits are sorted and the letters are sorted.
- It will also find that the last digit (1) is not greater than any letter (a, b).
- However, the original password "a1b" has a digit (1) coming after a letter (a), which violates the requirement.

### Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of the Correctness
The program should iterate through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If it finds such a case, it should immediately return "NO". Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    found_digit = False
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit():
            found_digit = True
        if found_digit and password[i+1].isalpha():
            return False
    if found_digit:
        digits = [char for char in password if char.isdigit()]
        if digits != sorted(digits):
            return False
    letters = [char for char in password if char.isalpha()]
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that no digit comes after a letter and that both digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
