You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem requirements and the given example inputs and outputs.

The problem is to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays (segments) such that:
1. The first segment starts at index 1.
2. The last segment ends at index n.
3. Each segment is contiguous and non-overlapping.
4. The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of all segments is less than or equal to x.

The provided program seems to follow a strategy that iterates through the bits of x from the most significant to the least significant and checks how the segments can be formed based on the current bit.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the provided program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a`.

2. **Bitwise Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to -1, which will store the maximum number of segments.
   - It iterates over each bit position from 29 down to 0 (since the maximum value of `x` and `a[i]` is less than \(2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks the `i`-th bit of `x` (`u`) and the count of elements in `a` that have a 1 at the `i`-th bit (`v`).
     - If both `u` and `v` are 0, it skips to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is odd, it returns `ans` immediately because it's impossible to partition the array such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of all segments is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, it tries to form segments such that the XOR of each segment has a 0 at the `i`-th bit and updates the array `a` with these segments.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, it skips to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even, it counts the maximum number of segments that can be formed such that the XOR of each segment has a 0 at the `i`-th bit and updates `ans`.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - After processing all bits, the program returns the maximum of `ans` and `len(a)`, which handles the case where no segments can be formed and the entire array is a valid segment.

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described above. However, there are some subtle points to consider:

- The program does not handle the edge cases explicitly, such as when `x` is 0 or when all elements in `a` are 0.
- The program assumes that the bitwise operations and the logic for counting segments are correctly implemented, which seems to be the case based on the provided example inputs and outputs.

Let's verify the correctness using the provided example inputs and outputs:

- For the first test case: `n = 3`, `x = 1`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
  - The correct output is `2`, which matches the program's output.
- For the second test case: `n = 2`, `x = 2`, `a = [1, 1]`
  - The correct output is `2`, which matches the program's output.
- For the third test case: `n = 2`, `x = 2`, `a = [1, 3]`
  - The correct output is `1`, which matches the program's output.
- For the fourth test case: `n = 2`, `x = 3`, `a = [0, 0]`
  - The correct output is `2`, which matches the program's output.
- For the fifth test case: `n = 3`, `x = 2`, `a = [0, 0, 1]`
  - The correct output is `3`, which matches the program's output.
- For the sixth test case: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`
  - The correct output is `-1`, which matches the program's output.
- For the seventh test case: `n = 2`, `x = 2`, `a = [2, 3]`
  - The correct output is `1`, which matches the program's output.
- For the eighth test case: `n = 5`, `x = 0`, `a = [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]`
  - The correct output is `2`, which matches the program's output.

Based on the provided example inputs and outputs, the program seems to be working correctly.

Correctness: **True**
