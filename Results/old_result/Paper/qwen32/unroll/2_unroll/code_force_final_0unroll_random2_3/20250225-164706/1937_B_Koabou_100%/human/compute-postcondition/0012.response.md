The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(s, sep='')
```

From the initial state, we know that:
- `s` is the string `'1110'`.
- The `sep=''` argument specifies that there should be no separator between the elements being printed. However, since `s` is a single string and not a list or tuple of multiple elements, the `sep` argument does not affect the output in this case.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string `s` as it is.

Output: **1110**
