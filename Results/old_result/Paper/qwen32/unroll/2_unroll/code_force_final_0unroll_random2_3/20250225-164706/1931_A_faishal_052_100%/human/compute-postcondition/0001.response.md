The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `info`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `cases`. The only change is the creation of the `info` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `cases` is an input integer, `info` is an empty list.**
