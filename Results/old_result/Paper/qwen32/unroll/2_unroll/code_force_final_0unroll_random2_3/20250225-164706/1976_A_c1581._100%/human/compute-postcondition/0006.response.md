The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range is determined by `len(digits)`. For the loop to execute, `len(digits)` must be at least 1, meaning that the `digits` list must contain at least one digit.

The state of `password`, `digits`, and `letters` is provided, but according to the task, we can only adjust the state of objects in the loop head. Therefore, we need to ensure that `digits` has at least one element.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password, sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 digit; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password, sorted in ascending order; `i` is 0**
