The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers with specific constraints. The code only affects `x` and `n` by reading their values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x.**
