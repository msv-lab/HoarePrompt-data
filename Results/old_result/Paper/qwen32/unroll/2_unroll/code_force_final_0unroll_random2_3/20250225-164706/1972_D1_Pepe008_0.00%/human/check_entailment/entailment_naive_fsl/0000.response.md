Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the code and the problem statement:

1. **Problem Statement:**
   - We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\) (which should be \(m\)) and calculates \(x\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - If \(a - i(i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` should iterate over \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) from 1 to \(m\). The current code incorrectly fixes \(b\) and iterates over \(i\) (which is not defined in the problem).
   - The calculation of `x` and the condition `if a - i * (i - 1) > 0` do not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Example of Incorrectness:**
   - Consider the test case \(n = 2, m = 3\).
   - The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\) because:
     - For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
     - For \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
     - For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).
   - The program will not correctly count these pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
