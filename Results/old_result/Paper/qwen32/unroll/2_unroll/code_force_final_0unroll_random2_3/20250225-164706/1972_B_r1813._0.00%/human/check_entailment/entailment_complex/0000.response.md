### Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the number of "U" (facing up) coins in each test case. The strategy is as follows:
- If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice will win.
- If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob will win.

The provided program reads the input, processes each test case to count the number of "U" coins, and then determines the winner based on the parity of this count. The logic is:
- For each test case, it counts the number of "U" in the string `s`.
- If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The code correctly implements the above logic. It handles the input parsing, the counting of "U" characters, and the decision-making process based on the parity of the count.
