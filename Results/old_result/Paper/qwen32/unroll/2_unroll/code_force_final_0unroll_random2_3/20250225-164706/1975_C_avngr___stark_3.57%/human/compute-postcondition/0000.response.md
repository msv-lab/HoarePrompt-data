Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which indicates the number of test cases. The other parts of the initial state, including the details about the arrays, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
