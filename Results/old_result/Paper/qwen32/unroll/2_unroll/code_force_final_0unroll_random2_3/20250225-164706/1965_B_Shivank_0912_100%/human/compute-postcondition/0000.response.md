Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. `t` is assigned the value of the integer input.**

In simple terms, `t` has been updated to the integer value provided by the input, while all other conditions and constraints remain the same.
