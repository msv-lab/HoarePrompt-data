You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))

def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` calculates and returns the total number of additional occurrences needed for each character in the string `a` to reach at least `m` occurrences, where `a` consists of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems), `m` (number of rounds), and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program initializes a list `count` of size 7 (to represent the 7 difficulty levels 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem. This is done using the formula `ord(char) - ord('A')` which correctly maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, ..., and 'G' to 6.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed. It iterates through the `count` list and for each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m` (the number of rounds), it adds the difference `(m - count[i])` to the `needed_problems` variable. This ensures that for each round, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level.

4. **Output**: The program prints the `needed_problems` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case as per the problem description. It handles the input and output requirements appropriately and performs the necessary calculations accurately.

Correctness: **True**
