The `print(2)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. The print statement will output the integer `2` regardless of the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the constraints and properties of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`.
2. The `print(2)` statement directly outputs the integer `2`.

Since the print statement does not reference any variables or conditions that could change its output, the output is constant and determined solely by the statement itself.

Output: **2**
