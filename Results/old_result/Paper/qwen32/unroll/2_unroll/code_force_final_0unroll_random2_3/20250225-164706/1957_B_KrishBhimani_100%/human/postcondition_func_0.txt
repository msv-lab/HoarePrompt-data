The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs `n` integers. If `n` is 1, the output is `k`. Otherwise, the output starts with the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, followed by the difference between `k` and this largest power of 2 minus 1, and then `n-2` zeros if necessary.
