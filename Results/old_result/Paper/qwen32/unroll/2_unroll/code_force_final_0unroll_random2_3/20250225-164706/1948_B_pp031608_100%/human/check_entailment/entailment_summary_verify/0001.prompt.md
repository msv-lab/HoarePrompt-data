You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be rearranged in a specific way to ensure that each number is not less than the previous one when digits are considered. It prints 'YES' if the list can be rearranged as per the condition, otherwise 'NO'. The input values `t` and the lists remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if it's possible to sort an array by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits and inserting those digits back into the array at the same position.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one, it tries to split the previous element and checks if the resulting sequence (including the current element) can be sorted. If it can't be sorted, it sets the answer to `False` and breaks out of the loop. If it successfully checks all elements, it prints `YES`.

However, there are some issues with this approach:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program only considers splitting the element immediately before the current one if it's out of order. It then checks if the resulting sequence can be sorted, but this doesn't guarantee that the entire array can be sorted by further operations. The program should consider all possible splits and their effects on the entire array.

2. **Incorrect Answer Handling**: The program sets `ans` to `False` if the sequence can't be sorted after splitting, but this doesn't account for the possibility that further splits could eventually lead to a sorted array. It should continue checking all possible splits and their effects.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The program doesn't correctly simulate the process of splitting elements and checking if the entire array can be sorted. It only checks a limited set of possibilities and can thus give incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the process of splitting elements and check if the array can be sorted. A more appropriate approach would involve checking if, at any point, we can split an element to make the array sorted. This would likely involve a more complex algorithm, such as backtracking or dynamic programming, to explore all possible splits and their effects.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It has logical flaws and doesn't explore all possible splits and their effects on the array.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
