The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It then calculates and prints the number of segments in the string, where a segment is defined as a contiguous sequence of the same character. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string, it subtracts one from the segment count before printing.
