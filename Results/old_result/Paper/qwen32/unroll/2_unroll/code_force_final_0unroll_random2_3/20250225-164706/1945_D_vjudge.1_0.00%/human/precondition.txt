Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where a_i is the cost Kirill has to pay to swap places directly with the person at position i. The following line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) where b_i is the cost Kirill has to pay to each person between positions j and i (exclusive) if he swaps places with the person at position j. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
