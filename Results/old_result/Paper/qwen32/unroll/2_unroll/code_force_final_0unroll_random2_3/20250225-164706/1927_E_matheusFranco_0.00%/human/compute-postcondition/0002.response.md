The code snippet provided initializes a variable `idx` to `0`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `permutation` is still a list of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, with new values provided by the input; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `0`; `idx` is `0`.**
