The code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `check`, which is \(2^{31} - 1\). This value is a constant and does not depend on the initial values of `t` or `times`. Therefore, the values of `t` and `times` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `times` is an input integer; `check` is 2147483647**.
