### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case requires generating a \(2n \times 2n\) checkerboard pattern. The program correctly handles the cases when \(n\) is 1, 2, 3, or 4 by explicitly printing the corresponding checkerboard patterns. However, the program does not handle cases where \(n\) is greater than 4. According to the problem statement, \(n\) can be as large as 20, so the program is incomplete and incorrect for values of \(n\) greater than 4.

For \(n > 4\), the program outputs the string 'No esta en el rango' (which translates to 'Not in the range'), which is not the expected output. Instead, the program should generate the appropriate checkerboard pattern for any valid \(n\) within the range of 1 to 20.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
