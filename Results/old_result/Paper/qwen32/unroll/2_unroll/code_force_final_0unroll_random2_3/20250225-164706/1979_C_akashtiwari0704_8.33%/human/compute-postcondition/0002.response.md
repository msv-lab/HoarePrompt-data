The given code processes each test case `T` independently. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets` and a list `a` of `bets` integers. It calculates the product of all elements in the list `a`, then computes a new list where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in the original list. It sums up these new values and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the product. If it is, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the new list of values.

Since the code processes each test case independently and modifies only local variables within the loop, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged after all iterations of the loop. The variables `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans` are local to each iteration and do not persist across different test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `k` is a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
