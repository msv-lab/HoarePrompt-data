Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, followed by `t` pairs of an integer `n` and a string `s`. For each string `s`, it prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in `s` is greater than 2 and even, or if `s` does not contain '11'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value and the variables `start` and `end` mentioned in the annotations are not used or relevant to the function's behavior.**
