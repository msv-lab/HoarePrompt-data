To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the code:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, an integer `n` is read, representing the number of strings to be processed.
3. Two variables `a` and `b` are initialized to `0` and `''` respectively.
4. An inner loop runs `n` times, where each iteration reads a string `s`.
5. For each string `s`:
   - If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
6. After processing all strings for a test case:
   - If `a` is not `0` (i.e., it has been set to 'TRIANGLE'), it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints the value of `b` (which could be 'SQUARE' or remain `''` if no string had more than one '1').

Since the output is determined by the print statements inside the loop, the output state after all iterations will be a series of printed strings, either 'TRIANGLE', 'SQUARE', or potentially an empty string if no conditions are met.

Given the format requirement, we can describe the output state as:

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` printed lines, each being either 'TRIANGLE', 'SQUARE', or an empty string, depending on the input strings for each test case.**
