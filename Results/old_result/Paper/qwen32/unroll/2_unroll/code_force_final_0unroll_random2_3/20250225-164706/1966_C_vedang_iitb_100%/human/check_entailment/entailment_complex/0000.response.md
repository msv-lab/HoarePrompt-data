Reasoning:
The provided program is attempting to solve the given problem by calculating the Minimum Excluded (MEX) value of the sorted list of stones in each pile and then determining the winner based on whether the MEX is even or odd. However, this approach is incorrect for the problem at hand.

The problem is a variant of the Nim game, specifically a mis√®re Nim game with a twist in the move rules. The standard strategy for Nim games involves calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player to move (Alice in this case). Otherwise, it is winning.

The provided code does not follow this strategy. Instead, it calculates the MEX of the pile sizes, which is not relevant to determining the winner in this particular game scenario. The MEX calculation does not provide the necessary information about the game state to correctly determine the winner under optimal play.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the XOR of all pile sizes for each test case and determine the winner based on the result of that calculation.

Correctness: **False**
