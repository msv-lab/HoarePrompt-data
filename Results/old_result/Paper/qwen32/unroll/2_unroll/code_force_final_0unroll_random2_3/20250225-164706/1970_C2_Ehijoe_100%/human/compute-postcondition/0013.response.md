Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighboring nodes, `start` is the integer value provided by the user input such that `1 <= start <= n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes from the `nodes` dictionary, `moves` is the return value of `func_1(nodes, start)`, and `moves` is False**
