To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the provided `for` loop, the only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the range defined by `cases`. Therefore, the state of `cases` is critical for determining whether the loop will execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for i in range(cases)`. This means the loop will execute `cases` times, with `i` taking values from 0 to `cases-1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if and only if `cases` is greater than 0. If `cases` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjustments Needed**: Given that `cases` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= cases <= 100`, it is already ensured that `cases` will be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `cases` to ensure the loop executes.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, and `info` are not part of the loop head and do not directly affect whether the loop will execute. Hence, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Based on this analysis, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustment to ensure the loop executes, as `cases` is already within the valid range (1 to 100).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `cases` is an input integer such that 1 <= cases <= 100, `info` is a list of `cases` number of sorted lists, each containing 3 integers derived from the values of `lex` as described.**
