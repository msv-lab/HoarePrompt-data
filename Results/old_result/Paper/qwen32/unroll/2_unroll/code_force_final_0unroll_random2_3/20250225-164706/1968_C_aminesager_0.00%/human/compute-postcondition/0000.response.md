The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, representing the number of test cases. The initial state mentions the existence of variables related to the test cases and the array elements, but since `t` is the only variable explicitly assigned a value in the provided code snippet, we will only update `t`. The other variables (`n`, `x_2`, `x_3`, ..., `x_n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); the other variables (`n`, `x_2`, `x_3`, ..., `x_n`) remain unchanged.**
