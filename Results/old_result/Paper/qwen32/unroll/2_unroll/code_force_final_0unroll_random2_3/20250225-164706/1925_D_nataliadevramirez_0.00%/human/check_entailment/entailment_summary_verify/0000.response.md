### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or incorrect.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - `friendships`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains two children indices and their friendship value.

2. **Objective**:
   - Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the output should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

3. **Key Points**:
   - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(\frac{2k}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The expected contribution of a friendship pair to the total sum should account for the increasing friendship values.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function calculates the result for each friendship pair by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`).
  - This approach incorrectly assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen `k` times.
  - It does not account for the probability of choosing a specific pair and the increasing friendship values.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads multiple test cases.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program:
  - The program does not consider the probability of choosing a specific pair.
  - It does not account for the increasing friendship values over the `k` excursions.
  - The provided counterexample demonstrates the incorrectness of the program.

#### Correct Approach:
- For each friendship pair `(a, b, f)`, the expected number of times it is chosen in `k` excursions is \(\frac{2k}{n(n-1)}\).
- The expected contribution of this pair to the total sum should be calculated as:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{x} i \cdot \text{Pr}(i) = \sum_{i=1}^{x} i \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} = f \cdot \left(\frac{2k}{n(n-1)} \cdot \frac{k+1}{2}\right) = f \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{n(n-1)}
  \]
- The final result should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
