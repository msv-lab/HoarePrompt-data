You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`, and then computes and prints a specific value `ans` based on these inputs. The value of `ans` is calculated by starting with `n` and adding the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This process is repeated for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

### Analysis
The program iterates over each test case and calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the provided formula. However, the formula used in the program does not match the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which suggests that it is counting pairs where `b = 1`. However, the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` is not derived from the problem statement.

2. **Loop over `b`**: The loop iterates from `b = 2` to `min(n, m)`. This part seems correct in terms of iterating over all possible values of `b`.

3. **Calculation of `ans`**: The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for each `b`. To determine the correct number of valid pairs for each `b`, we need to ensure that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve iterating over each possible `b` and then finding the valid `a` values that satisfy the condition. Here's a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. For each `b` from `1` to `m`:
   - For each `a` from `1` to `n`:
     - Check if `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`
     - If true, increment the count.

However, the provided program does not follow this approach and instead uses a formula that does not match the problem description.

### Conclusion
Given the mismatch between the provided formula and the problem description, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program uses a formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` which is not derived from the problem statement. A correct implementation would involve checking each pair `(a, b)` to see if it satisfies the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Since the provided program does not do this, it is incorrect.
