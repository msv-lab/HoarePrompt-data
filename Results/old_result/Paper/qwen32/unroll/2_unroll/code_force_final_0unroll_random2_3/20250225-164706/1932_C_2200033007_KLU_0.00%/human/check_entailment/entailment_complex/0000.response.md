### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the list `a` of `n` integers, and the string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, which processes the commands in the string `s` and outputs the required remainders.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Building List `b`**:
     - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to 0 and `n-1`, respectively.
     - It iterates through the string `s` and appends elements from `a` to the list `b` based on the command ('L' or 'R'):
       - If the command is 'L', it appends `a[l]` to `b` and increments `l`.
       - If the command is 'R', it appends `a[r]` to `b` and decrements `r`.
     - This part correctly constructs the list `b` as a permutation of `a` based on the sequence of commands in `s`.
   
   - **Calculating Cumulative Products**:
     - The function initializes an empty list `ans` and a product variable `p` to 1.
     - It iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, updating the product `p` by multiplying it with each element and appending the result to `ans`.
     - This part correctly calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
   
   - **Returning the Result**:
     - The function returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in their original order.
     - This is where the program deviates from the problem requirements. The problem requires the remainders of the product modulo `m` at each step, not the cumulative products themselves.

4. **Correctness of the Output**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and then reverses the list to get the cumulative products in their original order.
   - However, the problem requires the remainders of the product modulo `m` at each step, not the cumulative products themselves.
   - Therefore, the program does not correctly compute the required remainders.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the remainders of the product modulo `m` at each step as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
