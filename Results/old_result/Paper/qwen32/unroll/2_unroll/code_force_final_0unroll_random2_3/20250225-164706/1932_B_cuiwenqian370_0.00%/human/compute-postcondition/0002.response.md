The variable `t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list. The values of `path`, `n`, and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs such that 1 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line by spaces, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
