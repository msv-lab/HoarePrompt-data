You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, s is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings s across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `n` is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case. For each binary string, it calculates a specific value based on the arrangement of '0's and '1's in the string and prints this value. The function handles multiple test cases, where the total number of test cases is provided as input, and the length of each binary string is between 2 and 200,000 characters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the given cyclic shift operation. Let's analyze why:

The program calculates the cost based on the number of zeros and ones encountered. However, the logic does not correctly account for the cost of cyclically shifting substrings to sort the string. The cost is supposed to be the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted, and the program does not compute this cost accurately.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:

**Example:**
Input:
```
1
101011
```
Expected Output:
```
5
```
Explanation of the expected output:
- One optimal strategy is to choose substring [1, 3]: 101011 -> 011011 (cost = 3)
- Then choose substring [2, 4]: 011011 -> 001111 (cost = 3)
- Total cost = 3 + 2 = 5

However, the provided program will not produce this output. The program's logic does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifting and cost calculation as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the cost calculation correctly for all cases.
