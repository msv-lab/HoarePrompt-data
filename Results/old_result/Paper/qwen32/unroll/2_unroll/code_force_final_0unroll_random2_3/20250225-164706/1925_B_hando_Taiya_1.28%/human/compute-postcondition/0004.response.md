To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the definition of the variable `ans` provided in the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is defined as the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` are given but remain unchanged.

### Analysis:
The variable `ans` is determined based on the divisors of `x`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Divisors of `x`**: These are numbers that divide `x` without leaving a remainder.
2. **Condition**: The divisor should be less than or equal to `n`.
3. **Pair Divisors**: If `i` is a divisor of `x`, then `x // i` is also a divisor of `x`.
4. **Largest Divisor**: Among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is the largest one.

Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`.

### Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or its corresponding pair divisor x // i that is also less than or equal to n)**
