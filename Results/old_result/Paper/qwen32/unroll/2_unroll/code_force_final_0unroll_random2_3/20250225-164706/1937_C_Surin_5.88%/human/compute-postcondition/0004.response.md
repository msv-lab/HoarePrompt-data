Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any direct input parameters. It interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of a secret permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can issue up to 3n queries per test case in the form of "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of `p`. The goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized.**
