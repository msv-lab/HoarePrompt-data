You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()

            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)

        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of constraints. For each test case, it determines the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints and prints the result for each test case. The constraints specify that `k` must be greater than or equal to some values, less than or equal to some values, and not equal to some values. If no such `k` exists, the result is 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. We have `t` test cases.
2. Each test case has `n` constraints.
3. There are three types of constraints:
   - Type 1: `k >= x`
   - Type 2: `k <= x`
   - Type 3: `k != x`
4. We need to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case.
5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and the answer is finite.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t = int(input())`: Read the number of test cases.
   - `r = []`: Initialize a list to store results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `n = int(input())`: Read the number of constraints for the current test case.
   - `cx = set()`: Initialize a set to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
   - `ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)`: Initialize `ax` to a very large number. This will store the smallest `x` from constraints of type 2.
   - `bx = -1`: Initialize `bx` to a very small number. This will store the largest `x` from constraints of type 1.

3. **Reading Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, read `a` (type of constraint) and `x` (value).
   - If `a == 1`, update `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
   - If `a == 2`, update `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
   - If `a == 3`, add `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no possible `k` that satisfies both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax`. Hence, append `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid `k` values:
     - `tmp = 0`: Initialize a counter for values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - Iterate over each value `i` in `cx`:
       - If `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, increment `tmp`.
     - The number of valid `k` values is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` (total possible `k` values minus those that are excluded by type 3 constraints).
     - Append this value to the result list `r`.

5. **Output:**
   - Print all results in `r`, separated by newlines.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly identifies the smallest `k` (`bx`) that must be satisfied by constraints of type 1 and the largest `k` (`ax`) that must be satisfied by constraints of type 2.
- It correctly handles constraints of type 3 by excluding values in the range `[bx, ax]` that are in the set `cx`.
- The logic for determining the number of valid `k` values (`ax - bx + 1 - tmp`) is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
