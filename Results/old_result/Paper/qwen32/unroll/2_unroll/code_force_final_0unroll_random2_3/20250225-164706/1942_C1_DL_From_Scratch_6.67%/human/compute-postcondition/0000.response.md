Output State: **`T` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), y is 0, and the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
