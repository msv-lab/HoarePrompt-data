The only variables in the loop head are `z` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because the loop will iterate `t` times. The variable `z` is the loop variable and its initial value before the loop starts does not matter since it will be set to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
