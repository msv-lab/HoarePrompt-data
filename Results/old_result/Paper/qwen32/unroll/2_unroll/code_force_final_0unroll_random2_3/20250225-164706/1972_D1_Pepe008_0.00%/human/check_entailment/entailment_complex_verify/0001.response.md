### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding and Condition**: The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It uses a loop to iterate over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates a value \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\), where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).
   - It adds \(x\) to the sum if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) and finally prints the sum minus 1.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The formula used to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values is not derived from the problem's condition. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked.
   - The program does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition directly, which is necessary to ensure correctness.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied.
   - This is demonstrated in the correct version of the program provided in the original assessment.

5. **Validation with Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case by iterating over possible values of \(b\), calculating \(x\) using the given formula, and summing these values.
   - The annotations do not indicate any direct checking of the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses an incorrect formula and does not directly check the condition specified in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
