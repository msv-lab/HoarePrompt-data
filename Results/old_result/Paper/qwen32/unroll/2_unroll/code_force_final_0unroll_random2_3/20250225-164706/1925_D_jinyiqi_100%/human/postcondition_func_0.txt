The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and `m` lines of three integers representing edges and their associated values. It computes a specific mathematical result based on these inputs and prints the result for each test case. The result is a modular inverse calculation involving sums and combinations derived from the input values.
