You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several logical errors and does not handle all possible cases correctly. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the moves of Alice and Bob. For example, the logic for checking if Alice can win by moving diagonally is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the fact that Bob can also move diagonally and could potentially block Alice's path.

2. **Incorrect Draw Conditions**:
   - The program incorrectly checks for draw conditions. For example, it does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice and Bob can move towards each other but cannot catch each other due to the constraints of the board.

3. **Incorrect Win Conditions**:
   - The program incorrectly checks for win conditions. For example, it does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice can move to Bob's position in the next turn, and vice versa.

4. **Incorrect Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when Alice or Bob is in the first or last row, respectively.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrect behavior of the program:

**Counterexample**:
```
1
2 2 1 1 2 2
```
**Expected Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Actual Output**:
```
Alice
```

In this case, Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (2, 2). Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left, but none of these moves will allow her to reach Bob's position. Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left, but none of these moves will allow him to reach Alice's position. Therefore, the game should end in a draw. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Alice".

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
