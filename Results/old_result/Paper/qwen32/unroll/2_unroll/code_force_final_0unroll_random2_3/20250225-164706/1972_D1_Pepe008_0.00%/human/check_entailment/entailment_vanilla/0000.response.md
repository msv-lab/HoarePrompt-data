Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The program is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements this logic.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.

2. **Logic to Calculate Valid Pairs:**
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The formula used to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\) is:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
     \]
     where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).
   - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to the sum.
   - Finally, it subtracts 1 from the sum and prints the result.

However, there are several issues with this approach:
- The formula used to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values is not derived from the problem's condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The logic seems to be incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly.

Let's write a correct version of the program for comparison:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# func()
```

The correct version of the program iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. This is the straightforward and correct way to solve the problem.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
