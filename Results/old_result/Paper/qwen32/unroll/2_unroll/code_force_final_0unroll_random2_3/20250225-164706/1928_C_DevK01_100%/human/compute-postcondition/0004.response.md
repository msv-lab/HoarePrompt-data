Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `w`; a TypeError is raised because `math.sqrt` cannot operate on a list; `w` is an integer. If `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.**
