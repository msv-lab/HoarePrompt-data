### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square based on the problem description and the function summary. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle and Square Detection**:
   - The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. However, a triangle can have multiple rows with different numbers of '1's, not just one '1' per row. For example, a triangle with `k=3` will have rows with 1, 3, and 5 '1's respectively.
   - The program checks if a row contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. However, this check is not sufficient to confirm that the shape is a square, as a triangle can also have multiple '1's in a row. For example, an upside-down triangle with `k=3` will have rows with 5, 3, and 1 '1's respectively.

2. **Lack of Detailed Shape Validation**:
   - The program does not validate the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square. For a square, all rows must have the same number of '1's, and these '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row must follow the pattern `2*i - 1` for a right-side-up triangle or `2*(k-i+1) - 1` for an upside-down triangle, where `i` is the row index starting from 1, and `k` is the number of rows in the triangle.
   - The program fails to check these specific patterns and instead makes a simplistic determination based on the number of '1's per row.

3. **Incorrect Output Logic**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if any row has exactly one '1', the shape is a triangle. This is not always true, as a square can also have rows with a single '1' if it is positioned at the edge of the grid.
   - The program does not handle cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle, which requires a different pattern of '1's compared to a right-side-up triangle.

### Example Test Case:

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
00100
01110
11111
01110
00100
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

In this case, the program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because it encounters rows with more than one '1', which could be part of either a square or a triangle. However, the shape in the grid is actually a triangle.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect. The program needs to be revised to properly detect the specific patterns of triangles and squares as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
