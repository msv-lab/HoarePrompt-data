Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines where each line contains two integers `a` and `x` (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The integer `a` denotes the type of constraint: if `a=1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`; if `a=2`, `k` must be less than or equal to `x`; if `a=3`, `k` must be not equal to `x`. The function returns `True` if there exists an integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
