Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0.**

Natural language: The variables `n` and `k` retain their initial properties and values. The list `costs` remains unchanged as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The variable `h` is newly introduced and is assigned the value 0.
