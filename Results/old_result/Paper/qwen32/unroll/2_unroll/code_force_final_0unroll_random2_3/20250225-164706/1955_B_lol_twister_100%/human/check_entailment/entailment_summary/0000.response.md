### Reasoning:
The provided program follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `c`, and `d`, and then reads the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Finding `a_{1,1}`**:
   - The program correctly identifies `a_{1,1}` as the minimum value in the list `l`.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - It then generates a list `li` containing all the elements that should be in the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k, h` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program compares the sorted `li` with the sorted `l`. If they are equal, it means that the input list can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and it returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison.

The program adheres to the problem requirements and correctly determines whether the provided list of integers can be rearranged to form the progressive square.
