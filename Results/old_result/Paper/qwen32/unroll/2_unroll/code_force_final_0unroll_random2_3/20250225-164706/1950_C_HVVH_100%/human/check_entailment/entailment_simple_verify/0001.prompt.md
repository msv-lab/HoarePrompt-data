You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly converts 24-hour format times to 12-hour format times.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is not necessary since the day part is determined during each iteration based on the hour value.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times.
   - For each test case, it reads a time string `s` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

3. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If the hour `h` is `0` (midnight), it sets `h` to `12` and `day` to `'AM'`. This is correct because midnight is represented as `12:00 AM` in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than `12` (PM times), it subtracts `12` from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`. This is correct because PM times in 24-hour format are `13` to `23`, which should be `01` to `11` in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is `12` (noon), it sets `day` to `'PM'`. This is correct because noon is represented as `12:00 PM` in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is between `1` and `11` (AM times), it sets `day` to `'AM'`. This is correct because these times are the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` with leading zeros for hours and minutes.

### Issues:
- The initialization of `day` to `'AM'` at the beginning of the function is redundant since `day` is reassigned in each iteration.
- The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as midnight (`00:00`), noon (`12:00`), and times in the AM and PM ranges.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the problem description. The output format matches the requirements, and all edge cases are handled properly.

Correctness: **True**
