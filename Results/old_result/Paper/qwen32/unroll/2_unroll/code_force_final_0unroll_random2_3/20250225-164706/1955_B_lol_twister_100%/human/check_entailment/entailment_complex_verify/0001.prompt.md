You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 25 * 10^4.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 25 * 10^4. `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`. `li` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is of the form a + k * c + d * h for k, h in the range [0, n-1].
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers sorted in ascending order where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is of the form a + k * c + d * h for k, h in the range [0, n-1], and `li` is sorted in ascending order. The list `l` is not equal to the list `li`.
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if the input list `l` of `n^2` integers can be rearranged into a sorted list where each element is of the form `a + k * c + d * h` for `k, h` in the range `[0, n-1]`, with `a` being the minimum value in `l`. It returns 'yes' if such a rearrangement is possible, otherwise it returns 'no'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
- **Progressive Square Construction**: The progressive square is constructed based on the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)c + (j-1)d \).
- **Given Values**: The initial value \( a_{1,1} \) is not directly given but is instead determined as the minimum value in the array since the problem states that the progressive square can be uniquely determined.
- **Verification**: For each test case, the program needs to check if the given array can be rearranged to form the progressive square as per the above formula.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read first.
   - For each test case, the values of \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \) are read.
   - The array \( l \) containing \( n^2 \) integers is read.

2. **Progressive Square Generation**:
   - The minimum value in the array \( l \) is considered as \( a_{1,1} \).
   - The program then constructs the progressive square by iterating over each cell \( (i, j) \) and calculating the value using the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)c + (j-1)d \).
   - These values are stored in a list \( li \).

3. **Verification**:
   - Both the generated list \( li \) and the input list \( l \) are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are, it means the array can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the initial value \( a_{1,1} \) as the minimum value in the array.
- It accurately constructs the progressive square using the provided formula.
- It correctly compares the sorted versions of the generated list and the input list to verify if the array can form the progressive square.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct as it properly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
