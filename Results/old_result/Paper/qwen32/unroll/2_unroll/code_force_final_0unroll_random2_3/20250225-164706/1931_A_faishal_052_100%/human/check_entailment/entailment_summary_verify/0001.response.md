### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that corresponds to a given encoded integer `n`.
- The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet (where 'a' = 1, ..., 'z' = 26).
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It enters a loop that runs twice to determine the first two letters:
     - If `lex < 28`, it assigns `1` to the current position in `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it assigns `26` to the current position in `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it again assigns `26` to the current position in `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it assigns the remaining value of `lex` to the third position in `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.

3. **Converting to Letters:**
   - For each test case, the program converts the values in `arr` to their corresponding letters by adding `96` (since `chr(97)` is 'a').
   - It concatenates these letters to form the word and prints it.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining First Two Letters:**
   - The program's logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. It does not correctly account for the smallest possible values for the first two letters.
   - The conditions in the loop do not ensure that the smallest possible values are chosen for the first two letters.

2. **Sorting Step:**
   - Sorting the list `arr` after determining the values does not ensure that the letters are in the smallest possible lexicographical order from the start.
   - The sorting step is unnecessary and does not address the core issue of choosing the smallest possible values for the first two letters.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, especially when `lex` is near the minimum or maximum possible values.

#### Correct Approach:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters (e.g., 'a' or 'b') and then calculate the third letter based on the remaining sum.
- Ensure that the sum of the three letters equals `lex`.
- The program should ensure that the letters are in the smallest possible lexicographical order from the start.

#### Example Fix:
To correctly implement the solution, we need to:
- Initialize the first two letters to the smallest possible values ('a' or 'b').
- Calculate the value of the third letter based on the remaining sum.
- Ensure that the sum of the three letters equals `lex`.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters
        for a in range(1, 27):
            for b in range(1, 27):
                c = lex - a - b
                if 1 <= c <= 26:
                    # Found the smallest lexicographical order
                    print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break

# Example usage
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
