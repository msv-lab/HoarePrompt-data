The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `path`, which is a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs, and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of signs such that 1 <= n <= 100. The function returns the calculated result based on the provided periodicities and the number of signs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `path` of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. It returns a calculated result based on these inputs.**
