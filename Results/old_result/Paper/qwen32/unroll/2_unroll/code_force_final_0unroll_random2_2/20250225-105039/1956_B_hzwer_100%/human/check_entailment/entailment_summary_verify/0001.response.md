### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - Each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - Players take turns placing cards on the table.
   - A player earns a point if they place a card that matches an integer already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To maximize your points, you need to place cards that match integers already on the table.
   - If you have a pair of the same integer, you can place one card, and if Nene doesn't have a matching card, you can place the second card later to score a point.
   - If you have a single card of a certain integer, you can only score a point if Nene places a matching card before you do.

3. **Strategy to Maximize Points:**
   - Count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - For each integer `x` with `cnt[x]` occurrences, you can score `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` points. This is because if you have `cnt[x]` cards of integer `x`, you can place `cnt[x] - 1` of them after Nene has placed the first one, earning `cnt[x] - 1` points.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - It uses a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It calculates the total number of points you can earn by summing up `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for each integer `x`.

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - It calculates the sum of excess counts for each integer in the list (i.e., the number of times each integer appears more than once) and prints this sum for each test case.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can earn by placing cards that match integers already on the table.
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently and adheres to the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the logic used to calculate the maximum number of points. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
