The code snippet provided initializes a variable `index` with the value `0`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `p`, `input`, or `data`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `index` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `index` is 0.**
