### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided `func_1` function does not properly enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter in the password. The function sorts the digits and letters separately and then compares the concatenated sorted string with the original password. However, this does not ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the original sequence.

The original assessment provides a counterexample: "a1b2c3". In this password, digits come after letters, which violates the condition. However, the function `func_1` does not detect this issue and would return `True` for this input, indicating the password is strong, which is incorrect.

The suggested corrected version of the function `func_1` properly checks for the condition that no digit should come after a letter by using a flag `digit_encountered`. This flag ensures that once a letter is encountered, no digit should appear afterward. Additionally, it checks if both the digits and letters are sorted individually.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly enforce the condition that no digit should come after a letter in the password.
