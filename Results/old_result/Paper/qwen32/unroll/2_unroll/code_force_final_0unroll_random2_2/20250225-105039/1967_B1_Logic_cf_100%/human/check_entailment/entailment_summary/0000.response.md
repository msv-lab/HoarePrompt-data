Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)` and calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the condition that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the program's logic seems to be flawed, as it does not correctly implement the condition for all pairs `(a, b)`.

The program calculates `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This calculation does not consider the `gcd(a, b)` for each `a` and `b` pair, and it does not iterate over all possible values of `a` for each `b`.

Let's break down the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`:

1. For `b = 1`, the condition simplifies to `a + 1` being a multiple of `gcd(a, 1)`, which is always true since `gcd(a, 1) = 1`. Thus, there are `n` valid pairs for `b = 1`.
2. For `b > 1`, the condition is more complex and requires checking for each `a` from 1 to `n` whether `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

The program does not perform this check for each `a` and `b` pair but instead uses a simplified formula that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

Hence, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
