Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and 1 <= `k` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an input integer within the range of 1 to 1000. The conditions for `n` and `k` for each test case remain unchanged.
