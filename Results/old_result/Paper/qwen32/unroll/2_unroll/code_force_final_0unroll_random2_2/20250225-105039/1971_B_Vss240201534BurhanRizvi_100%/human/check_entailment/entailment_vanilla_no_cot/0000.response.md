Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating a random permutation of the string and checking if it is different from the original string. However, this approach is not guaranteed to work in all cases. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Random Permutation**: The use of `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a permutation is not guaranteed to always produce a string different from the original string, especially for strings with repeated characters. This can lead to incorrect outputs where the program incorrectly reports "YES" followed by the original string when a valid rearrangement is not possible.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where the string length is 1 and the case where all characters in the string are the same. However, the logic for generating a different permutation can fail as mentioned above.

3. **Deterministic Approach**: A more reliable approach would be to systematically rearrange the string to ensure it is different from the original. For example, you could swap the first character with the second character if they are different, or find the first character that can be swapped with a different character later in the string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1 or len(set(s)) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s_list = list(s)
            # Try to find a different permutation
            for i in range(len(s_list) - 1):
                if s_list[i] != s_list[i + 1]:
                    s_list[i], s_list[i + 1] = s_list[i + 1], s_list[i]
                    break
            print('YES')
            print(''.join(s_list))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that if a valid rearrangement is possible, it will be found and printed.
