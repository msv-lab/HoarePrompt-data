Now, let's analyze the given task step by step.

The state before the loop starts is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

The for loop is:
```
for tc in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the loop variable is `tc`, and the range is determined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, as specified in the problem statement (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

The variable `t` is already given to be within the range 1 to 10^4, so no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. The variable `tc` is the loop variable and will take on the values from 0 to `t-1` during each iteration of the loop. However, we don't need to adjust `tc` before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Since `t` is already in the correct range and no adjustments are needed for `tc` before the loop starts, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
