Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4). It explicitly checks for these values and prints the corresponding checkerboard patterns. However, the problem description states that the input `n` can be as large as 20. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases for `n` within the given range (1 to 20). For example, if the input is `n = 5`, the program will output "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct 10x10 checkerboard pattern. Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
