The given code snippet attempts to return `a - 1`, which is not a valid operation in Python for lists. It seems like the intention might be to subtract 1 from each element of the list `a`. Since the code provided is not valid, I'll assume the intention and proceed accordingly.

Assuming the intention is to subtract 1 from each element in the list `a`, the output would be a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in `a`.

Output State: **The program returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.**
