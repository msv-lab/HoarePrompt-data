Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets given the constraints. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The code uses a variable `c` to accumulate the cost, but the initial value of `c` is set to `k * k / 2`, which is not the correct starting cost. The cost should start at 0 and accumulate based on the actual ticket purchases and their respective prices.

2. **Incorrect Purchase Logic**: The code sets `s` (the number of tickets to buy on each day) to `min(m, k)` and then subtracts `s` from `k`. However, the logic for determining how many tickets to buy on each day is not optimal. The code does not consider the increasing prices due to previous purchases, which is a critical part of minimizing the total cost.

3. **Incorrect Cost Accumulation**: The cost is accumulated using the formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This formula does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

4. **Sorting the Prices**: The code sorts the list of prices `l`. While sorting can be helpful to consider the lowest prices first, the logic for purchasing tickets needs to account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases, which the code does not handle correctly.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

**Actual Output from the Code:**
The code will not output `10` because it does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a greedy algorithm that considers the lowest available prices while also accounting for the increasing prices due to previous purchases.
