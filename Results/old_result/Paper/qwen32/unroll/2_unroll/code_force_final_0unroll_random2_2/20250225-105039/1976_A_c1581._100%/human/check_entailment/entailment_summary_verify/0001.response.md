Let's revisit the problem description and the provided code to determine if the program correctly verifies the strength of the passwords based on the given conditions.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits**: Assumed handled elsewhere.
2. **There should be no digit that comes after a letter**: All letters must come before any digits.
3. **All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order**: Digits must be in ascending order.
4. **All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order**: Letters must be in ascending order.

### Provided Code Analysis:
- The code separates the password into digits and letters.
- It sorts the digits and letters separately.
- It checks if the concatenation of the sorted letters followed by the sorted digits equals the original password.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` checks if the input `password` is already sorted such that all digit characters come before all lowercase Latin letter characters, and both groups are individually sorted in ascending order. It returns `True` if the password meets these criteria, otherwise it returns `False`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The code correctly separates and sorts the digits and letters.
- It correctly checks if the concatenation of sorted letters followed by sorted digits matches the original password.
- The original assessment incorrectly states that the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]` is incorrect. However, this condition is not part of the provided code anymore, and the code now correctly checks the concatenation.

### Correctness of the Code:
- The code ensures that all letters come before any digits by checking the concatenation of sorted letters and sorted digits.
- It ensures that both digits and letters are individually sorted by the `sort()` function.
- The logic in the corrected code is sound and correctly implements the problem's conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided code, after the correction, correctly verifies the strength of the passwords based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
