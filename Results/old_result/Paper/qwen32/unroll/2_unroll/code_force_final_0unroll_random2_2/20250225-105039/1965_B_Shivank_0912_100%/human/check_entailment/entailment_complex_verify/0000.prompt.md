You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        
        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The variable `t` retains its initial value, representing the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `k` do not retain any specific values as they are overwritten in each iteration. The variable `i` holds the value from the last test case, and `ans` holds the list from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates and prints the length of a specific list `ans` and the elements of `ans` based on the value of `k`. The list `ans` is constructed such that it contains three specific values derived from `k` and powers of 2, excluding the power of 2 that is used in one of the first three values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not guarantee that there is no subsequence of the sequence `a` with a sum of `k`, and it does not ensure that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

Let's analyze the program with an example:

### Example Case:
Input:
```
1
10 7
```

Expected Output:
The sequence should have a size at most 25 and should satisfy the conditions:
- There is no subsequence of the sequence with a sum of 7.
- For all `1 ≤ v ≤ 10` where `v ≠ 7`, there is a subsequence of the sequence with a sum of `v`.

Possible Correct Output:
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
Explanation of this output:
- The sum of any subsequence cannot be 7.
- All other sums from 1 to 10 except 7 can be formed:
  - 1: `[1]`
  - 2: `[2]`
  - 3: `[1, 2]`
  - 4: `[1, 3]`
  - 5: `[2, 3]`
  - 6: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - 8: `[8]`
  - 9: `[1, 8]`
  - 10: `[2, 8]`

### Actual Program Output:
The program generates the following output for the above input:
```
4
6 8 9 1
```
Explanation of this output:
- The sum of the subsequence `[6, 1]` is 7, which violates the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of 7.
- The sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 except 7 can be checked, but since the primary condition is violated, we can already determine the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
