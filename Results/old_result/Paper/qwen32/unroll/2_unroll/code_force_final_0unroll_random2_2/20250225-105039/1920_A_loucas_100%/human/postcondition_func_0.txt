The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of constraints. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of integers that satisfy all the given constraints. Constraints are categorized into three types: those that specify upper bounds, those that specify lower bounds, and those that specify exact values. The function ensures that the calculated number is non-negative, printing 0 if no integers satisfy the constraints.
