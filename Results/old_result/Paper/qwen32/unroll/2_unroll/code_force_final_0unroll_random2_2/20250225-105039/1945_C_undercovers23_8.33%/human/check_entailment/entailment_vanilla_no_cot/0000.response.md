Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Percentage Calculation Error**: The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages (multiplying by 100), which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect comparisons. The problem requires checking if the counts of 0s and 1s meet the condition of being at least half of the respective side's total, not percentages.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Valid Split**: The conditions `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` are incorrect. Instead, the conditions should be `zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and `one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the road can be placed before the first house (position 0) or after the last house (position n). Specifically, the checks for these cases are incorrect and can lead to wrong results.

4. **Inefficient List Operations**: The program uses lists to store valid positions and then sorts them, which is unnecessary and inefficient. It should directly track the optimal position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        zero, one = 0, s.count('1')
        best_pos = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i > 0 and s[i - 1] == '0':
                zero += 1
            if i < n and s[i] == '1':
                one -= 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil(i / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i) / 2):
                diff = abs(n / 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < best_pos):
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_pos = i
        
        print(best_pos)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the number of 0s and 1s on each side of the road, checks the conditions, and keeps track of the best position that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle of the village.
