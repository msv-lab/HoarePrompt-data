The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Given that `cases` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= cases <= 100`, it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute. The variable `n` and `info` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `i` is not yet initialized, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 78, `info` is an empty list**.

Since `i` is not yet initialized and its initialization is handled by the `for` loop, we don't need to specify it in the state. Therefore, the adjusted state only needs to ensure that `cases` is within the specified range.

Final State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 78, `info` is an empty list**.
