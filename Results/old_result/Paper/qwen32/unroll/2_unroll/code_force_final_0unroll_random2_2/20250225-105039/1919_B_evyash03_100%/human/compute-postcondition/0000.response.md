The code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 0. No other variables are affected. The initial state specifies that `expression` is a string of '+' and '-' characters and `length` is the length of that string.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of the characters '+' and '-', and `length` is a positive integer representing the length of the string such that `length` == `len(expression)`, `count` is 0.**
