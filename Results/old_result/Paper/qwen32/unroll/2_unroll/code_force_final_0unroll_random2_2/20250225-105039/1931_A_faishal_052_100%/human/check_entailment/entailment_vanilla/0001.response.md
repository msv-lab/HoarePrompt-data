Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
Given an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that could have been encoded as `n`. The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded word.

2. **Logic to Find the Word**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to fill the first two positions of `arr` with either 1 or 26 based on the value of `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78 (which is always true given the constraints), it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted.
   - The sorted list `arr` is added to `info` for each test case.

3. **Generating the Output**:
   - For each test case, the program constructs a string `temp` by converting each element in `arr` to the corresponding letter using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` (since 'a' is 97 in ASCII).
   - The constructed string is printed.

### Issues in the Program

- The logic for filling the first two positions of `arr` is flawed. The program does not correctly determine the smallest possible letters that sum up to `lex`.
- The sorting of `arr` is unnecessary and does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
- The program fails to consider the smallest possible values for the first two letters and directly assigns 1 or 26, which does not guarantee the smallest possible word.

### Correct Approach

To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to minimize the value of the first letter, then the second, and finally the third, while ensuring their sum equals `lex`. Here's a correct approach:

1. Start with the smallest possible value for the first letter (1, which corresponds to 'a').
2. Determine the smallest possible value for the second letter while keeping the sum constraint.
3. The third letter will be the remaining value.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program's logic, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
