The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer input from the user and assigning it to the variable `t`. This variable `t` likely represents the number of test cases to follow. The initial state does not specify the value of `t`, so after reading the input, `t` will have the value of the input integer. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; Each test case contains integers n, m, and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. For each of the m pairs of friends, the input provides three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i where a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
