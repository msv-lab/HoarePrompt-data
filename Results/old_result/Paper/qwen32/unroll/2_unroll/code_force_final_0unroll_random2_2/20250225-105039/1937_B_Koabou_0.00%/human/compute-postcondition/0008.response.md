The code snippet provided is:
```
t = 1
```
This line of code assigns the value `1` to the variable `t`. The values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`s` is either `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` where `i` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` if no such `i` is found; `x` is either the index `i` where the condition is met or `n - 1` if no such `i` is found; `t` is 1.**
