Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Use of Queries**: The program uses queries to find the maximum value in the permutation, but this does not directly help in finding the pair that maximizes the XOR operation. The program should instead focus on identifying the largest and second-largest values in the permutation, as these are the most likely to produce a high XOR value.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum XOR**: The program does not correctly identify the pair of indices that maximize the XOR. The strategy should involve selecting pairs that are likely to produce high XOR values, such as the largest and second-largest numbers in the permutation.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: While the program correctly iterates over multiple test cases, the logic within each test case is flawed.

Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Identify the Largest and Second-Largest Values**: Use queries to identify the largest and second-largest values in the permutation.
2. **Check for Maximum XOR**: Once the largest and second-largest values are identified, check if their XOR is the maximum possible. If not, check other pairs involving these values.

Below is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        # Find the maximum element
        max_idx = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', max_idx, max_idx, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if input() == '<':
                max_idx = i
        
        # Find the second maximum element
        second_max_idx = -1
        second_max_val = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if i == max_idx:
                continue
            print('?', max_idx, max_idx, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if input() == '>':
                if second_max_idx == -1 or input() == '>':
                    second_max_idx = i
                    second_max_val = i
        
        # Check pairs involving max and second_max
        max_xor = 0
        best_pair = (max_idx, second_max_idx)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i == max_idx or i == second_max_idx:
                continue
            print('?', max_idx, i, second_max_idx, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if input() == '>':
                best_pair = (max_idx, i)
            elif input() == '<':
                best_pair = (second_max_idx, i)
        
        print('!', best_pair[0], best_pair[1])
        sys.stdout.flush()

func()
```

This corrected program should correctly identify the pair of indices that maximize the XOR value within the given constraints.
