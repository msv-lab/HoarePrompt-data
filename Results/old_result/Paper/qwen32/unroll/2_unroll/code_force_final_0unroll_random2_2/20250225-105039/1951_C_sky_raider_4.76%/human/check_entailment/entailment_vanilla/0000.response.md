Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, given that:
- The price of tickets per day is provided in a list `a`.
- You can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on a given day increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))
```

#### Issues in the Code
1. **Initialization of `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This is incorrect. The value `c` should represent the total cost, which should start at `0`. The value `k * k / 2` seems to be an incorrect heuristic or leftover from a different problem.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
    - The loop iterates over each day, and for each day, it calculates the number of tickets to buy (`s = min(m, k)`).
    - It then updates the remaining tickets (`k -= s`).
    - The cost is updated as `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the price increase on subsequent days. The term `- s * s / 2` is not part of the problem's cost calculation and seems to be an artifact of a different problem.

3. **Price Increase**: The code does not correctly account for the price increase on subsequent days. The price increase mechanism described in the problem is not implemented.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we should:
1. Sort the prices in ascending order.
2. Start buying tickets from the cheapest day.
3. Keep track of the number of tickets bought and the price increase.
4. Ensure that we do not buy more tickets than allowed per day (`m`).

### Correct Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        prices.sort()
        cost = 0
        increment = 0
        i = 0
        while k > 0:
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            cost += tickets_to_buy * (prices[i] + increment)
            k -= tickets_to_buy
            increment += tickets_to_buy
            i += 1
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to improper initialization of the cost, incorrect cost calculation, and failure to account for the price increase mechanism.

**Correctness: False**
