Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The grasshopper starts at the top-left cell (1, 1) and can only move right or down. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string formed by the cells in the path from (1, 1) to (2, n) and the number of such paths that produce this smallest string.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Path Generation**:
   - The grasshopper can either stay in the first row or switch to the second row at any point.
   - We need to explore all possible paths and determine the lexicographically smallest one.
   
2. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - A string `s` is lexicographically smaller than another string `t` if at the first differing position, `s` has a smaller character.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - Once the smallest string is found, we need to count how many different paths can produce this string.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided code to see if it addresses these points correctly:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
        x = n - 1
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
    print(s, sep='')
    print(t)
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **Path Selection**:
   - The program seems to attempt to find a switch point from the first row to the second row, but the logic is flawed.
   - It does not correctly handle the case where the smallest string starts with '1' in the first row and continues in the second row.

2. **String Construction**:
   - The string `s` is constructed based on a specific condition, but it does not guarantee that it is the smallest possible string.
   - The program does not explore all possible paths to find the smallest lexicographical string.

3. **Path Counting**:
   - The path counting logic is incorrect.
   - The variable `t` is intended to count the number of paths that produce the smallest string, but the logic is flawed and does not correctly count all such paths.

### Conclusion

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to explore all possible paths and does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest string or the number of paths that produce it.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not guarantee finding the lexicographically smallest string or counting all paths that produce it.  
Correctness: **False**
