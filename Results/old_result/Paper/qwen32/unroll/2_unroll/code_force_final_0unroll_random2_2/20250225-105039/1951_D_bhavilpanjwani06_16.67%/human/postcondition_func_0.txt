The function reads pairs of integers `n` and `k` from the input for multiple test cases. For each test case, it prints "YES" followed by 1 and `n` if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints "YES" followed by 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
