Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for calculating the minimum cost to purchase the tickets is flawed. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the price increases that occur after purchasing tickets on a given day, nor does it correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Price Increase Handling**: The program does not correctly update the prices for subsequent days after purchasing tickets on a given day.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is incorrect. The program uses a formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` which does not correctly reflect the total cost of purchasing `s` tickets on day `i`.
3. **Sorting**: While sorting the list of prices is a good step towards minimizing cost, the program does not correctly implement the purchasing strategy based on the sorted prices and the price increase rules.
4. **Loop and Conditions**: The loop and conditions for purchasing tickets are not correctly implemented. The program does not ensure that the number of tickets purchased does not exceed `m` per day or that the total number of tickets purchased equals `k`.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach, such as using a priority queue (min-heap) to always purchase tickets from the cheapest available day, while also keeping track of the price increases over time.
