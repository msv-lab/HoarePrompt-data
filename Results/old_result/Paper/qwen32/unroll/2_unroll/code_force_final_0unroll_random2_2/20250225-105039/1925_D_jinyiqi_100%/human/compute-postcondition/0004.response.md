Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` represents the number of individuals, `m` represents the number of friendship pairs, and `k` is an integer. Additionally, the function receives `m` sets of three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` for each friendship pair, where `a_i` and `b_i` are distinct individuals and `f_i` is a value associated with their friendship. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints. Specifically, if any input violates the constraints (e.g., `n` or `m` are out of their specified ranges, or `a_i` and `b_i` are not within the range of 1 to `n`), the function may handle it accordingly. Otherwise, it performs some computation or evaluation based on the friendship pairs and returns a value.**
