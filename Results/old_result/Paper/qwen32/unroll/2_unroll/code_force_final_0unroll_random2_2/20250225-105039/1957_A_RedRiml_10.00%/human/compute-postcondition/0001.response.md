In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` and `w`. The loop will execute based on the value of `w`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a certain number of times specified by `w`, and it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

To ensure that the loop executes, `w` must be at least 1. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `w` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than or equal to 1**
