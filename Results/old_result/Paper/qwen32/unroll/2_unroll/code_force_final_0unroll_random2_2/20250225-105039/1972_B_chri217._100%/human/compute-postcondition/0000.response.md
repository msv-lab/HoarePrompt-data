The given code snippet calculates the number of 'U' characters in the string `case[1]`, which represents the state of each coin (facing up or facing down). The result is stored in the variable `ups`.

Given the initial state, `case` is a tuple or list where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the second element is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The variable `ups` is introduced and assigned the count of 'U' characters in `case[1]`.

Output State: **`case` is a tuple or list where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" representing the state of each coin; `ups` is the count of 'U' characters in `case[1]`.**
