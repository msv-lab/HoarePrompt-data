Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers with the following properties:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program generates a sequence `nums` based on the following logic:
1. It starts with a list of powers of 2 up to `2^20` (which is 1,048,576, more than enough to cover the range of `n` up to `10^6`).
2. It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it.
3. It adds three specific numbers to the list: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
4. It prints the length of the list and the list itself.

### Verifying the Program Logic:
1. **Exclusion of `k`**:
   - The program removes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and adds `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The key here is to ensure that no combination of these numbers can sum to `k`.

2. **Inclusion of all other sums**:
   - The initial list of powers of 2 can generate all numbers that are sums of distinct powers of 2, up to `2^21 - 1`.
   - By adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.
   - `k - nums[idx]` ensures that numbers just below `k` can be formed.
   - `k + 1` ensures that numbers just above `k` can be formed.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensures that numbers slightly larger than `k` can be formed, which helps in forming larger sums up to `n`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `k = 2`**
   - The sequence will be `[1, 2 - 1, 2 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1]` which simplifies to `[1, 1, 3, 4]`.
   - We can form sums 1 and 3, but not 2.
   - Correct.

2. **Test Case 2: `n = 6`, `k = 1`**
   - The sequence will be the powers of 2 up to 2^20, but the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1 is removed, and 0, 2, and 3 are added.
   - This ensures that no sum equals 1, but all other sums up to 6 can be formed.
   - Correct.

3. **Test Case 3: `n = 8`, `k = 8`**
   - The sequence will be the powers of 2 up to 2^20, but the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 8 is removed, and 0, 9, and 10 are added.
   - This ensures that no sum equals 8, but all other sums up to 8 can be formed.
   - Correct.

4. **Test Case 4: `n = 9`, `k = 3`**
   - The sequence will be the powers of 2 up to 2^20, but the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 3 is removed, and 0, 4, and 5 are added.
   - This ensures that no sum equals 3, but all other sums up to 9 can be formed.
   - Correct.

5. **Test Case 5: `n = 10`, `k = 7`**
   - The sequence will be the powers of 2 up to 2^20, but the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7 is removed, and 0, 8, and 9 are added.
   - This ensures that no sum equals 7, but all other sums up to 10 can be formed.
   - Correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly generate sequences that satisfy the conditions for all given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
