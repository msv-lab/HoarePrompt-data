The given code initializes two variables `t` and `ans`. The variable `t` is initialized as an empty list, and `ans` is initialized to -1. The initial state provides information about `n`, `x`, and `a` but does not affect the initialization of `t` and `ans`. Therefore, after executing the given code snippet, the values of `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_3()`, `x` is a non-negative integer returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1**.
