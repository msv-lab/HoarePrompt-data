The provided code snippet only reads a line from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. No other variables are modified or introduced in the given code, and no calculations or operations are performed. Therefore, the state of the program remains largely unchanged except for the introduction of the `input` variable.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives. This is followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readline`.**
