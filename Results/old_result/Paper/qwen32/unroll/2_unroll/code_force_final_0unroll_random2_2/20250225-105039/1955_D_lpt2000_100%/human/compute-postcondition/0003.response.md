Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= k <= m <= n`, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers. List `a` contains `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6, and list `b` contains `m` integers each between 1 and 10^6. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific value or result for each test case.**
