To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is `i` and the length of `costs`. The loop will execute if the length of `costs` minus `(k - 1)` is greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains `i` and `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0`.
3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.
   - This implies `len(costs) > k - 1`.
   - Since `costs` is derived from `rows` and each element in `costs` is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `len(costs)` is equal to `len(rows)`.

Therefore, `len(rows)` must be greater than `k - 1` for the loop to execute. The initial state of `i` does not need to be adjusted as it is initialized by the `range` function.

**State**: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers with each sublist representing a row in the grid and containing `m` integers, with the first and last integers in each sublist being 0, and `len(rows)` must be greater than `k - 1`; `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list**.
