#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives multiple test cases. For each test case, it is given an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: results
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: results
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of coins `n` is odd and if the count of "U" in the string exceeds the count of "D". If both conditions are met, it outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".
