Postcondition: **a is a list of k integers where 1 <= k <= 100, a is strictly increasing (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k), and each element in a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100. b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100, and each element in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100. Additionally, the list a is less than or equal to the list b (a <= b).**
