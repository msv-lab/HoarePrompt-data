To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the problem and the solution provided step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around the number of facing-up coins ('U'). The key insight to solving this problem is to recognize that the game's outcome depends on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even. This is because:
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of facing-up coins, and vice versa.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she faces an odd number of facing-up coins.
- The player who is forced to face a situation with no facing-up coins loses.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1`**: This function reads the input and organizes the test cases into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins and the string representing the coins' states.
2. **`func_2`**: This function takes a single test case (a tuple with the number of coins and the string of coin states) and determines the winner based on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.

The logic in `func_2` is correct:
- It counts the number of facing-up coins (`ups`) in the string.
- It returns 'YES' if the number of facing-up coins is odd (`ups % 2` is True) and 'NO' if it is even.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, given valid inputs as per the problem statement, the program will produce the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
