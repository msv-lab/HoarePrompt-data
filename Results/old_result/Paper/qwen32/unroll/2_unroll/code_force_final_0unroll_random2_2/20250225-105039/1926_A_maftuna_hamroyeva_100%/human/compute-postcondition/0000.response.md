The value of `t` is assigned the value of the integer input. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32 remains valid. The information about the test cases and their strings is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting solely of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct.**
