The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on these inputs. The value is determined by sorting the list, iterating through it, and applying a series of arithmetic operations involving `m`, `k`, and the elements of the list.
