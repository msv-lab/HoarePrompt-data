To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `x * x <= n`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `x` is 1.
- `cnt` is 0.

The loop condition `x * x <= n` needs to be true for the loop to execute. Since `x` is initialized to 1, the condition simplifies to `1 * 1 <= n` or `1 <= n`. This means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The variable `m` is not part of the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `cnt` is also not part of the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted either.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is at least 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0**
