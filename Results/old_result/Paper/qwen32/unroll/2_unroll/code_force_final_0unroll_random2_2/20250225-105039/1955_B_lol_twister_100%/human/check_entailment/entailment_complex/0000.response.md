### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged to form a specific sequence that represents a "progressive square" matrix. The matrix is constructed based on the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \), where \( a \) is the minimum value in the list, \( k \) and \( h \) are indices ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \), and \( c \) and \( d \) are given constants.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integers \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
   - It then reads the list \( l \) of \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Finding the Minimum Value:**
   - The program finds the minimum value \( a \) in the list \( l \). This value is intended to be the starting point of the progressive square.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square:**
   - The program generates a list \( li \) of \( n^2 \) integers using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for all combinations of \( k \) and \( h \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).

4. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both the input list \( l \) and the generated list \( li \) are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted list \( l \) is equal to the sorted list \( li \). If they are equal, it means the elements of \( l \) can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the program returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Uniqueness of Progressive Square:** The problem statement ensures that for any values of \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), there exists exactly one progressive square. This means that if the generated list \( li \) matches the sorted list \( l \), then \( l \) indeed represents the elements of the progressive square.
- **Sorting:** Sorting both lists ensures that the order of elements does not affect the comparison, as the problem only requires that the elements match, not their order.
- **Efficiency:** The program efficiently generates the progressive square and performs the comparison, which is feasible given the constraints (with the maximum number of elements being \( 25 \times 10^4 \)).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list of integers can form the progressive square matrix as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
