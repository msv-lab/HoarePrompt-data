You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or such that `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to find the maximum possible balance (GCD) of a problemset consisting of `n` sub-problems, where the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Balance Definition**: The balance is the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - `1 <= t <= 10^3` (number of test cases)
   - `1 <= x <= 10^8` (difficulty of the main problem)
   - `1 <= n <= x` (number of sub-problems)
3. **Objective**: For each test case, determine the maximum possible balance.

### Strategy:
To maximize the balance, we need to find the largest integer `d` that can be the GCD of `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x`. This means:
- `d` must be a divisor of `x`.
- The sum of `n` integers, each being a multiple of `d`, should equal `x`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating over possible divisors of `x` and checking if they can be the GCD of `n` sub-problems.

#### Code Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
2. **Finding Divisors**: For each test case, the code iterates from `1` to `isqrt(x)` (inclusive) to find divisors of `x`.
3. **Checking Feasibility**: For each divisor `i`:
   - If `n <= x // i`, then `i` could be a possible balance.
   - If `n <= i`, then `x // i` could be a possible balance.
4. **Updating Maximum Balance**: The code keeps track of the maximum balance found.

### Correctness:
The code logic seems correct in terms of finding the maximum possible balance by considering divisors of `x` and checking if they can be the GCD of `n` sub-problems. However, there is a subtle issue in the logic:
- The condition `elif n <= i` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The `if` condition `if n <= x // i` already covers all possible cases where `i` can be a valid balance.

### Conclusion:
The provided code has a logical error in the `elif` condition which can lead to incorrect results in some cases. However, the core idea of checking divisors and their feasibility is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False** 

The code is not entirely correct due to the unnecessary `elif` condition, which can lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases.
