### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotations in detail to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting**:
    - The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
    - It then reads the list of prices `l` and sorts it in ascending order.
    - **Annotation**: The list of prices is sorted, which is a good start as it allows the program to consider the lowest prices first.

2. **Initialization**:
    - `s` is initialized to 0. `s` will hold the number of tickets bought on the current day.
    - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This is problematic because the cost should start at 0, not `k * k / 2`.

3. **Main Loop**:
    - The loop iterates over each day.
    - `s = min(m, k)`: This sets `s` to the lesser of the maximum tickets that can be bought in a day (`m`) and the remaining tickets to be bought (`k`).
    - `k -= s`: This reduces the remaining number of tickets by `s`.
    - `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`: This accumulates the cost. However, this formula does not account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

4. **Output**:
    - The final accumulated cost `c` is printed.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Initial Cost**:
    - The initial cost `c` is set to `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect. The cost should start at 0.

2. **Incorrect Cost Accumulation**:
    - The cost formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases. The price on day `i` should be adjusted by the number of tickets bought on previous days.

3. **Greedy Logic**:
    - The code does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the cost by accounting for the increasing prices due to previous purchases. A more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a greedy strategy that considers the lowest available prices while also accounting for the increasing prices.

#### Counterexample:

Let's consider the provided counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

**Actual Output from the Code:**
The code will not output `10` because it does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

#### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve:
1. Sorting the prices in ascending order.
2. Iteratively buying tickets from the lowest available prices while keeping track of the number of tickets bought so far to adjust the prices of subsequent days.
3. Accumulating the cost correctly by considering the adjusted prices.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues identified and the counterexample, the original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets given the constraints.

**Final: False**
