grid is a list of lists (2D list) of characters ('0' or '1'), where each inner list has the same length as the number of inner lists, representing an n x n binary grid with 2 <= n <= 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
