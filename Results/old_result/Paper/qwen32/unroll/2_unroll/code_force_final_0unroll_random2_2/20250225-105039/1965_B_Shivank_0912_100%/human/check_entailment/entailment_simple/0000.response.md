### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to k:**
   - The program calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` using a while loop. This is done by incrementing `i` until `1 << (i + 1)` (which is `2^(i+1)`) is greater than `k`. At the end of the loop, `1 << i` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Construct the Sequence `a`:**
   - The sequence `a` is initialized with three elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that there is no subsequence summing to `k` because the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` cannot be used to form `k` with this element.
     - `k + 1`: This value is greater than `k` and thus cannot contribute to a subsequence summing to `k`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This value is also greater than `k` and helps in forming sums greater than `k`.
   - The program then adds the powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` (since `1 << 20` is `1048576` which is greater than `10^6`) to the sequence `a`, except for `1 << i` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.

4. **Output the Sequence:**
   - The program prints the length of the sequence `a` and the elements of `a`.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Condition 1:** There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  - The inclusion of `k - (1 << i)` and the exclusion of `1 << i` from the sequence `a` ensures that no combination of elements in `a` can sum to `k`.
  
- **Condition 2:** For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
  - The inclusion of all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19` (excluding `1 << i`) allows for the formation of any sum up to `2^20 - 1` (which is greater than `10^6`) except for `k` itself. Since `n <= 10^6`, this condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
