The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This input represents the number of integers in the list `a` for each test case. The other variables `t`, `a`, and the constraints on them remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the integer read from input, where 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.**
