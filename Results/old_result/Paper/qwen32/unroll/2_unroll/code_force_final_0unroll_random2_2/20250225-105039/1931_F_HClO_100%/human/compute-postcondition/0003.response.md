Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of participants and `k` is the number of test cases. It also accepts `k` lines of `n` distinct integers each, representing the order of participants shown to the participant `a_{i0}`. The function returns a value for each test case based on the given input, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided constraints and relationships.**
