Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly account for all the necessary problem difficulties. Specifically, it does not include 'G' in the set of difficulties it checks for, even though 'G' is one of the required difficulties ('A' to 'G'). This means the program might incorrectly determine that it needs fewer problems than it actually does if there are not enough problems of difficulty 'G'.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Include 'G' in the set of difficulties
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version includes 'G' in the set of difficulties that need to be checked, ensuring that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed.
