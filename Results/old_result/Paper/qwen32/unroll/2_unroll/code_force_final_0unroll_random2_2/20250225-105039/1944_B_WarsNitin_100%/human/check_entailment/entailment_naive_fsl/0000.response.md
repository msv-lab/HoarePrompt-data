Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans2` for all test cases. The logic used in the program is not robust enough to guarantee the required property.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
The program should output two lines of 4 integers each, such that the bitwise XOR of the integers in the first line equals the bitwise XOR of the integers in the second line. For example:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
or any other valid pair of subsets that satisfy the condition.

**Actual Output:**
The provided program might output something like:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
```
or other incorrect combinations because the logic does not ensure that both `ans1` and `ans2` have exactly `2k` elements and that their XOR values are equal.

**Why the Program is Incorrect:**
The program attempts to construct `ans1` and `ans2` by appending elements from the sorted halves `b` and `c` of the input array `a`. However, it does not guarantee that both `ans1` and `ans2` will have exactly `2k` elements, and it does not ensure that their XOR values are equal. The logic for appending elements to `ans1` and `ans2` is flawed and can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the program, a more systematic approach is needed to ensure that both `ans1` and `ans2` have exactly `2k` elements and that their XOR values are equal. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm or a backtracking approach to find valid subsets `l` and `r` that satisfy the conditions.
