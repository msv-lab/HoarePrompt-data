Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string. It counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string, removes all occurrences of 'map', and then counts 'pie' again in the modified string. For each test case, it outputs the sum of these counts.**
