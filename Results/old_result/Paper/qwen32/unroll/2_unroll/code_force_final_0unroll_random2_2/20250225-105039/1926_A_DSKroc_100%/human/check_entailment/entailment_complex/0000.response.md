Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine which letter, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in each of the given strings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. These counters are used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, respectively.
   - The program then reads a string `s` of length 5 for each test case.

3. **Counting Characters:**
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is 'A', it increments the counter `ac`. If the character is 'B', it increments the counter `bc`.

4. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting the characters in the string, the program compares the values of `ac` and `bc`.
   - If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A', indicating that 'A' appears more frequently in the string.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B', indicating that 'B' appears more frequently in the string or that 'A' and 'B' appear with the same frequency (in which case the problem implicitly allows either 'A' or 'B' to be printed, but the provided code will always print 'B' in this case).

5. **Distinct Strings:**
   - The problem states that all `t` strings are distinct, and the program does not need to ensure this; it simply processes each string independently.

The program correctly handles all the given constraints and requirements. It reads the input, counts the characters, and prints the correct result for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
