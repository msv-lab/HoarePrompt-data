### Reasoning:
The given program is intended to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) for each test case, where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the implementation provided does not correctly address this problem. Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement.

The program calculates `ans` for each test case as follows:
1. Initialize `ans` to `n`.
2. For each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, it adds the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to `ans`.

This formula does not match the condition that a + b should be a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). Instead, the program seems to be implementing a different logic that does not accurately solve the given problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) holds true. This would involve calculating the gcd for each pair, which is computationally expensive given the constraints (n, m up to 2 * 10^6).

The provided solution does not perform this check, and thus it is incorrect based on the problem description.
