Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, but it seems to be incorrectly implemented. The function is supposed to simulate the game rounds and determine the number of winners for each initial number of players `n_i`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not reflect the rules of the game at all. It simply returns `a - 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. This logic has no relation to the game rules where players are removed based on the positions specified in the sequence `a`.

The correct approach would involve simulating the rounds of the game for each `n_i`, removing players according to the positions in `a`, and counting the remaining players as winners.

Correctness: **False**
