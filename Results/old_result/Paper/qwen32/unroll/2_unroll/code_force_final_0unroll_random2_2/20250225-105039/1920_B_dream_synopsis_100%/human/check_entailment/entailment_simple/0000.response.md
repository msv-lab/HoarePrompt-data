### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob perform their respective operations.

1. **Alice's Move:**
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements from the array.
   - To maximize the sum, Alice should ideally remove the smallest `k` elements from the array.

2. **Bob's Move:**
   - Bob can multiply up to `x` elements of the array by -1.
   - To minimize the sum, Bob should ideally flip the sign of the `x` smallest elements that remain after Alice's move.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the array in descending order.
   - It then iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove (`i` from `0` to `k`).
   - For each `i`, it calculates the sum of the remaining elements after Alice's removal and then considers the effect of Bob's move.
   - If `i` elements are removed, the sum of the remaining elements is `sum1 - sum(a[:i])`.
   - Bob can then flip the sign of up to `x` elements from the remaining `a[i:]`.
   - The sum after Bob's move is adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the `x` smallest elements from `a[i:]` (since flipping the sign of a number `a` changes the sum by `-2 * a`).

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program maintains a running sum `sums` that is adjusted as elements are removed and signs are flipped.
   - The program keeps track of the maximum sum achievable after both players have made their moves.

### Analysis of the Program:

- The program correctly sorts the array in descending order to facilitate the removal of the smallest elements.
- It correctly iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove and calculates the sum after her move.
- It correctly adjusts the sum to account for Bob's move by flipping the sign of the smallest elements.
- The program keeps track of the maximum sum achievable and prints it for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players and produces the correct output for the given examples and constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
