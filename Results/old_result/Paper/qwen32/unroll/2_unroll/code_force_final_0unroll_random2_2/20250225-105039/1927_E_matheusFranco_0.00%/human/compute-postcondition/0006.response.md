To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers with 2 <= k <= n, and k is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `idx_v` is 1.
   - `curr_v` is 1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The outer loop runs `k` times, with `i` taking values from 0 to `k-1`.
   - For each `i`, the inner `while` loop assigns `curr_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` and increments `curr_v` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k` until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than the length of `permutation`.

3. **Detailed Execution:**
   - For `i = 0`:
     - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 0.
     - The `while` loop assigns `curr_v` to `permutation[0]`, `permutation[k]`, `permutation[2k]`, and so on, incrementing `curr_v` each time.
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 1.
     - The `while` loop assigns `curr_v` to `permutation[1]`, `permutation[k+1]`, `permutation[2k+1]`, and so on, incrementing `curr_v` each time.
   - This pattern continues for `i = 2` to `i = k-1`.

4. **Final `permutation` List:**
   - The `permutation` list will be filled with values starting from 1, incrementing by 1 each time, in a pattern where the `i`-th value of `curr_v` is placed at every `k`-th position starting from `i`.

5. **Output State:**
   - The `permutation` list will have values filled in a specific pattern based on the value of `k`.
   - `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` will be updated based on the last iteration of the loop.

Let's illustrate this with an example where `n = 10` and `k = 4`:

- `i = 0`: `permutation[0], permutation[4], permutation[8]` are set to 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- `i = 1`: `permutation[1], permutation[5], permutation[9]` are set to 4, 5, 6 respectively.
- `i = 2`: `permutation[2], permutation[6]` are set to 7, 8 respectively.
- `i = 3`: `permutation[3], permutation[7]` are set to 9, 10 respectively.

Thus, the final `permutation` list will be `[1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6]`.

**Generalizing the Output State:**

- The `permutation` list will have values filled in a pattern where each `i`th value of `curr_v` starts filling from the `i`-th position and fills every `k`-th position thereafter.
- `idx` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `idx_v` remains 1 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `curr_v` will be `n + 1` after the loop as it is incremented `n` times.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n, and k is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` elements filled in a specific pattern where each `i`th value of `curr_v` starts filling from the `i`-th position and fills every `k`-th position thereafter; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1`.**
