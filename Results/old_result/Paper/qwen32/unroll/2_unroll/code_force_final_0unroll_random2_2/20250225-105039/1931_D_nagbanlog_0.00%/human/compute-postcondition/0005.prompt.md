You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple where the first element is an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the second and third elements are integers x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9. The fourth element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in `test_cases` is a tuple where the first element is an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the second and third elements are integers `x` and `y` such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9; the fourth element is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
