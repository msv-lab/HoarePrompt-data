Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - 1)`, `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w; it is guaranteed that x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b; the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `r` is a list of integers read from input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`; `x2` is greater than `x1`; and (x2 - x1) is even; `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y2` is greater than or equal to 1, then `a` is set to 1 - 1. Otherwise, if `y2` is less than 1, then `a` is set to `m - 1`; `b` is `x2 - x1`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. The current value of `a` is `y1 - 1` because `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `y1` has been changed to 1. The value of `t` is now `abs(y2 - 1)`. The value of `a` is recalculated as `y1 - 1`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
