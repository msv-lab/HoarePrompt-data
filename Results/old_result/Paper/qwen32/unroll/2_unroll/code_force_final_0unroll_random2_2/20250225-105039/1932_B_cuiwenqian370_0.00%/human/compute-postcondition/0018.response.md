Postcondition: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros except `dp[0]` which is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', and `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*'. If `n` is greater than 1, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1]` is `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`.**
