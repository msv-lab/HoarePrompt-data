To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times if `t` is greater than 0.

Given that `t` is already described as an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. The variables `n` and the list `a` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be within the range [1, 1000], no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute `t` times as expected.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
