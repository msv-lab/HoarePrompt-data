The code snippet creates a list `pre` that contains the indices (1-based) of all '>' characters in the string `s1`. The length of `s1` is `n`, and this value remains unchanged. The list `pre` will be specific to the input string `s1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` equals the length of `s1`, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.**
