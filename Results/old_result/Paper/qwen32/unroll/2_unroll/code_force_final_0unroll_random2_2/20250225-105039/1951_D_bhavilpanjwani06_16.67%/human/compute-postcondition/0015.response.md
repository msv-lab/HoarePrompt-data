Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input for the current test case such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, then the current value of `k` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.**
