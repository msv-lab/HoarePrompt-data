Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown

The task is to find a sequence of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to a given integer \( k \).
2. For all integers \( v \) from 1 to \( n \) (excluding \( k \)), there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to \( v \).

### Analysis of the Provided Program

Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, \( n \) and \( k \) are read.

2. **Determine the Largest Power of 2 Less Than \( k \):**
   - The variable \( i \) is used to find the largest power of 2 (denoted as \( 1 << i \)) that is less than \( k \).

3. **Construct the Sequence:**
   - The sequence starts with three elements: \( k - (1 << i) \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 1 + (1 << i) \).
   - The program then appends \( 1 << j \) (which is \( 2^j \)) for \( j \) from 0 to 19, excluding \( i \).

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the sequence is printed.
   - The sequence itself is printed.

### Verification of the Program's Logic

Let's verify if the constructed sequence meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Condition 1: No Subsequence Sums to \( k \):**
   - The sequence contains \( k - (1 << i) \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 1 + (1 << i) \). 
   - The smallest sum we can get from the sequence that includes \( k + 1 \) is \( k + 1 \), which is greater than \( k \).
   - The sum \( k - (1 << i) + (1 << i) = k \) is not possible because \( 1 << i \) is not in the sequence, and the next smallest power of 2 is \( 1 << (i+1) \), which is greater than \( k \).

2. **Condition 2: All \( v \) (1 to \( n \), except \( k \)) Can Be Formed:**
   - The sequence includes powers of 2 up to \( 2^{19} \) (which is more than enough to form any number up to \( n \) given \( n \leq 10^6 \)).
   - The only restriction is that \( k \) cannot be formed. This is ensured by the construction of the sequence, especially by excluding the power of 2 that would allow forming \( k \).

### Conclusion

The provided program constructs a sequence that satisfies both conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
