### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges over a river grid. The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports in a single row of the grid.
   - It starts by incrementing the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1.
   - Then, for each subsequent element, it finds the minimum value among the previous `d` elements, adds the current cell's depth, and increments by 1. This ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`.
   - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports in that row.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles the main logic for each test case.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and then reads the grid of river depths.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in the `costs` list.
   - It then calculates the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these sums in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which represents the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges.

### Analysis:

- The logic for calculating the cost of supports in a single row (`func_1`) seems correct based on the problem's requirements.
- The logic for calculating the total cost of `k` consecutive bridges (`func_2`) also seems correct, as it considers all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

Given the explanation and the provided annotated states, the program appears to correctly implement the required solution.

### Correctness:
**True**
