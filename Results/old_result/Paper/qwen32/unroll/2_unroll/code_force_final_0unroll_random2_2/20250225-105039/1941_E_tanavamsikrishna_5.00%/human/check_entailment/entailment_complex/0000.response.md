Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum total cost of installing supports for k consecutive bridges on a grid representing a river. The grid has n rows and m columns, and the cost of installing a support in cell (i, j) is a_{i, j} + 1. The constraints on the supports are that they must be placed in the first and last columns (depth 0), and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d.

Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **func_1(row, d)**:
   - This function calculates the cost of placing supports in a single row.
   - It increments the first d-1 elements by 1 because supports must be placed at the first column and within d distance.
   - For each subsequent element, it calculates the cost by adding the minimum of the previous d elements plus 1 to the current element's depth.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost for that row.

2. **func_2()**:
   - This function reads the input parameters (n, m, k, d) and the grid (rows).
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of placing supports in that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of k consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all sets of k consecutive rows.

The program's logic is based on the assumption that the cost for each row is independent of other rows, which is correct according to the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row under the given constraints. The function `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum total cost for placing k consecutive bridges.

Given that the functions are implemented as described and the problem constraints are handled correctly, the program appears to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
