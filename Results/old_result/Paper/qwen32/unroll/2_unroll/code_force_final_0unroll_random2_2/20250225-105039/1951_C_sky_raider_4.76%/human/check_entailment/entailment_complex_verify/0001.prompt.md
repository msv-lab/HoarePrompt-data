You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on these inputs. The value is determined by sorting the list, iterating through it, and applying a series of arithmetic operations involving `m`, `k`, and the elements of the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days with the given constraints:
- A person may purchase no more than `m` tickets per day.
- If a person purchases `x` tickets on day `i`, all subsequent days' ticket prices will increase by `x`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Sorting the list of ticket prices.
2. Iteratively purchasing tickets starting from the lowest price.
3. Adjusting the number of tickets to purchase each day based on the remaining tickets needed (`k`) and the maximum allowed (`m`).
4. Calculating the cost by adjusting for the increasing prices.

However, there are several issues with the program:
1. The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is not a meaningful starting point for the cost calculation.
2. The logic for calculating the cost is incorrect. The program subtracts `s * s / 2` from the cost, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
3. The program does not correctly account for the increasing prices of subsequent days.
4. The loop continues for all `n` days, even if `k` tickets have been purchased.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Sort the list of ticket prices.
2. Iterate through the sorted list, purchasing tickets each day up to the maximum allowed (`m`), and adjust the remaining tickets (`k`).
3. Calculate the cost by multiplying the number of tickets purchased on each day by the current price and add it to the total cost.
4. Increase the price for subsequent days by the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
