You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive. The sum of the lengths of all strings s across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The printed values of `ans` for each of the `n` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case. For each string, it calculates a value based on the positions of '0's and '1's and prints this value. The printed value for each test case represents the number of valid pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the substring s[i:j+1] contains at least one '0' and one '1'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using cyclic shifts on any substring of the string. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `k` is `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program takes the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
3. It converts the string into a list of integers (0s and 1s).
4. It counts the total number of 0s in the string.
5. It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
6. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
7. It iterates through the string:
   - If the current character is 0, it adds 1 to the cost if there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the current character is 1, it adds the number of remaining 0s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost.
8. Finally, it prints the total cost for each test case.

### Logic Verification:
1. **Counting Cost for 0s**:
   - When a 0 is encountered and there have been 1s before it, it means that this 0 needs to be moved past those 1s to the left, incurring a cost. The cost is 1 for each such 0 because it can be moved by a cyclic shift of the substring containing this 0 and the 1s before it.
   
2. **Counting Cost for 1s**:
   - When a 1 is encountered, all remaining 0s need to be moved to the left of this 1 to sort the string. The cost is the number of remaining 0s because each of these 0s needs to be moved past this 1.

### Edge Cases:
- If the string is already sorted (all 0s followed by all 1s), the cost is 0.
- If the string is completely 0s or completely 1s, the cost is also 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. It correctly accounts for the cost of moving 0s past 1s and vice versa.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
