Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a strictly increasing list of k integers (1 <= k <= 100) with each element between 1 and 100, and `b`, which is a list of q integers (1 <= q <= 100) with each element between 1 and 100. The function returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`. If the first condition is not met, it returns list `b`.**
