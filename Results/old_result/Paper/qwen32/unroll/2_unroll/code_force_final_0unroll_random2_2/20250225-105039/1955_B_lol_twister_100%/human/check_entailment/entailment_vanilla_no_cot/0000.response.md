To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Progressive Square Construction**:
   - The square is of size `n x n`.
   - The value at position `(i, j)` in the matrix is calculated as `a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`.
   - Given `a_{1,1}`, `c`, and `d`, the matrix can be uniquely constructed.
   
2. **Verification**:
   - Given an array `b` of `n^2` integers, the program needs to verify if these integers can form the progressive square for the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It also reads the array `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Progressive Square Generation**:
   - The program finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l` and assumes it as `a_{1,1}`.
   - It then generates the progressive square values using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - These values are stored in the list `li`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l`.
   - It then compares the two lists.
   - If they match, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues:
1. **Assumption of `a_{1,1}`**:
   - The program assumes the minimum value in the array `l` is `a_{1,1}`. However, this is not necessarily true. `a_{1,1}` is a specific value used to construct the matrix, and it might not be the minimum value in the matrix.
   - The correct approach should involve generating the matrix for all possible values of `a_{1,1}` in the range of the input array and checking if the sorted array matches.

2. **Handling of Output Case**:
   - The problem states that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). The program returns 'yes' and 'no', which is correct, but it should be consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, especially the incorrect assumption of `a_{1,1}`, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
