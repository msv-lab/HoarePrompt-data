Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each of the following `t` lines, it receives a single binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function processes each binary string and returns the count of '1's in each string.**
