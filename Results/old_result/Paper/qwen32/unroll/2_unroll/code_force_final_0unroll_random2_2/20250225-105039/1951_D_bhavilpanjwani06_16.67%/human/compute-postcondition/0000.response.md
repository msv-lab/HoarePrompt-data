The code snippet provided reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}. After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, but the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided in the input for the current test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input for the current test case such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.**
