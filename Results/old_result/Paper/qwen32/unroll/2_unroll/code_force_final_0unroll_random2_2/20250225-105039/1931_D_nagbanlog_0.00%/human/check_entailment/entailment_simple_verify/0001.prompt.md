You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) in the array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis
The program iterates over each test case and for each test case, it calculates the number of beautiful pairs. Here's how it does it:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is a list to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).
   - `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Processing Each Number**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` as `num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - It calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This is based on the condition that \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\), which implies \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(a_j \equiv (x - a_i \% x) \% x \pmod{x}\).
   - `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y` because for the condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\), we need \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\).

3. **Updating Beautiful Count**:
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is already in `freq`, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
   - It then updates the frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq`.

4. **Storing Results**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array for a test case, it appends `beautiful_count` to `results`.

### Correctness Check
The logic for calculating `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is correct based on the problem requirements. The program correctly uses a frequency dictionary to count the number of valid pairs without having to check each pair explicitly, which makes it efficient.

However, there is a subtle issue in the program:
- The program prints debug statements (`print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')` and `print(f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}')` and `print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')`), which are not required in the final output. These should be removed for the program to be correct according to the problem's output specifications.

### Conclusion
The core logic of the program is correct, but the presence of unnecessary print statements means the program does not strictly adhere to the problem's output requirements. If these print statements are removed, the program would be correct.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False** (due to unnecessary print statements affecting the output format)
