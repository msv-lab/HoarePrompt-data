Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of valid pairs (a, b) for each test case. However, the logic within the program does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand why.

The problem requires counting pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

The program's logic seems to be based on a different formula or approach, as indicated by the commented-out section. The current implementation calculates a value `suma` and adjusts it based on a formula involving `a` and `b`, but it does not correctly check the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- For the test case \( n = 10 \) and \( m = 8 \), the valid pairs are:
  - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)
- The program's output for this test case is 14, which matches the expected result, but this does not necessarily mean the program is correct for all test cases.

The commented-out section of the code suggests a nested loop that checks each pair (i, j) to see if \( (j + i) \% (j \cdot \gcd(i, j)) == 0 \), which aligns with the problem's requirement. However, the actual implementation does not use this logic.

Given the discrepancy between the problem's requirements and the provided program's logic, we cannot conclusively say the program is correct without a thorough verification against all possible test cases.

Correctness: **False**
