The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` as long as they meet the given conditions. The conditions specified (`1 <= t <= 1000`, `1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}`, `n >= k`, `n != k`, and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`) do not affect the output of the print statement directly since the statement does not reference these variables. 

So, the output will simply be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
