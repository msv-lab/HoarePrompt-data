The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it processes the list and prints the number of unique elements remaining after each element is processed, considering the operation `i ^ 2147483647` (where `^` is the bitwise XOR operation) to determine uniqueness.
