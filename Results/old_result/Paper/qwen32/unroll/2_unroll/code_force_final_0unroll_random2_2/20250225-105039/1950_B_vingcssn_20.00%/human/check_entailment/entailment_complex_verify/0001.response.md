### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is not scalable and does not handle all valid inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The program explicitly prints the checkerboard pattern only for `n` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4. For any other value of `n` (specifically, `n` greater than 4), it outputs "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern.

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code confirm that the program does not handle cases where `n` is greater than 4. The annotations state that the program prints predefined patterns for `n` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and for any other value of `n`, it prints "No esta en el rango".

Since the program fails to generate the correct output for `n` values greater than 4, it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final: **False**
