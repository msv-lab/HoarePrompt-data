The given initial state provides values and conditions for several variables, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on these variables. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it's irrelevant for the print statement).
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]` (again, the exact values depend on `k`, but they are not used in the print statement).
- `h` is `k` and it is not less than `k` (this condition is always true by definition).

Since the `print` statement is `print('YES')`, it will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h`.

Output: **YES**
