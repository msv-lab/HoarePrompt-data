You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

    #State: info is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three integers sorted in ascending order, representing the processed values for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 78). It then computes a string of three characters corresponding to the values derived from `n` and prints this string for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
Given an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that could have been encoded as `n`. The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded word.

2. **Logic to Find the Word**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to fill the first two positions of `arr` with either 1 or 26 based on the value of `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78 (which is always true given the constraints), it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted.
   - The sorted list `arr` is added to `info` for each test case.

3. **Generating the Output**:
   - For each test case, the program constructs a string `temp` by converting each element in `arr` to the corresponding letter using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` (since 'a' is 97 in ASCII).
   - The constructed string is printed.

### Issues in the Program

- The logic for filling the first two positions of `arr` is flawed. The program does not correctly determine the smallest possible letters that sum up to `lex`.
- The sorting of `arr` is unnecessary and does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
- The program fails to consider the smallest possible values for the first two letters and directly assigns 1 or 26, which does not guarantee the smallest possible word.

### Correct Approach

To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to minimize the value of the first letter, then the second, and finally the third, while ensuring their sum equals `lex`. Here's a correct approach:

1. Start with the smallest possible value for the first letter (1, which corresponds to 'a').
2. Determine the smallest possible value for the second letter while keeping the sum constraint.
3. The third letter will be the remaining value.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program's logic, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
