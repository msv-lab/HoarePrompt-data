The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the input so that `int(input())` returns a value greater than or equal to 1. The state of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` does not affect the execution of this particular loop, as they are not used in the loop header.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the input to the loop is a positive integer.

State: **`int(input())` must return a value greater than or equal to 1**
