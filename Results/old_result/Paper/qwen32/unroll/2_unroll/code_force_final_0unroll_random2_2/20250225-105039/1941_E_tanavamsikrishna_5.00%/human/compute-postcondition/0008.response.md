Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), `k` (number of bridges), and `d` (maximum distance between supports). It also accepts a 2D list `rows` representing the grid. The function returns a result indicating whether the grid can be properly supported with the given constraints on bridges and distances.**
