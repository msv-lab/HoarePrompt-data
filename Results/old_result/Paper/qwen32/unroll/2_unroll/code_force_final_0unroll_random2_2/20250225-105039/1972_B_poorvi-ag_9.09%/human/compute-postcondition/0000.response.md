The code snippet provided only reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. No other variables are affected or modified by this line of code. Therefore, the initial state of the variables `n` and `s` remains unchanged, and `t` now holds the integer value read from the input.

Output State: **The function receives multiple test cases. For each test case, it is given an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
