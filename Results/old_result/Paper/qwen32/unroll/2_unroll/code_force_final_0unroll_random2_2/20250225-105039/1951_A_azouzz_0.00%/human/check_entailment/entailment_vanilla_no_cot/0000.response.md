Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description specifies a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that should scan subdirectories within the current directory, check if their names fall within a given range, and then generate specific Python files for HTML files found within those directories. However, the given program defines a different function `func_1()` that reads input values and performs a check on a string `s` to determine if it contains a specific pattern of '1's. This is unrelated to the task described in the problem statement.
