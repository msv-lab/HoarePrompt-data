Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4. The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses for each test case. The second line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 if the resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
