The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of houses and their preferences for living on either the left or right side of the street. For each test case, it determines and prints the optimal split point where the percentage of residents preferring each side is at least 50%. If no such split point exists, it returns either the start or end of the street based on the overall preference.
