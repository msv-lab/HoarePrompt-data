Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the product of all multipliers and then distributing the bets based on the product divided by each multiplier. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less than the return for each outcome.

Let's consider why this approach might fail:

1. **Product Calculation**: The product of the multipliers can become very large, and the division to determine the bets can result in very large numbers, which might not be optimal or even correct.

2. **Sum of Bets**: The condition `if sumo >= prod` checks if the total bet is greater than or equal to the product, but this does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome. The program should ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome, not just the product.

3. **Optimal Distribution**: The problem can be solved by using a simpler approach where you can assign bets based on the multipliers directly. For example, you can assign bets such that the total bet is minimized while still satisfying the condition for each outcome.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        # Initialize bets to 1 for each outcome
        b = [1] * bets
        total_bet = bets
        # Adjust bets to ensure the condition is met
        for i in range(bets):
            if total_bet >= a[i]:
                b[i] = total_bet // (a[i] - 1) + 1
                total_bet = sum(b)
        if total_bet >= min(a[i] * b[i] for i in range(bets)):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(' '.join(map(str, b)))

func()
```

This corrected version initializes the bets to 1 for each outcome and then adjusts them to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome. If it's not possible to find such a distribution, it outputs -1.
