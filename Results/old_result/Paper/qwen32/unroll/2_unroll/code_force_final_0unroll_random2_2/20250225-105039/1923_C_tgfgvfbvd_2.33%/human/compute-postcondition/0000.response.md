In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `t`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. The variables `n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, and `r_i` are related to the test cases inside the loop and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the only variable we need to ensure is `t` to be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
