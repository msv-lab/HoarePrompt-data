Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is that the program incorrectly calculates the product of the array elements based on the commands. Specifically, it does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements after each command.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Product**: The program calculates the product of the elements that are removed, not the product of the elements that remain in the array after each command.
2. **Reversing the Order**: The program reverses the order of the elements that are removed and then calculates the product, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the program, we need to correctly compute the product of the elements that remain in the array after each command. This can be done by maintaining the product of all elements initially and then updating it based on the commands:

- If the command is 'L', divide the product by the leftmost element and remove the leftmost element from the array.
- If the command is 'R', divide the product by the rightmost element and remove the rightmost element from the array.

However, since direct division might not work with remainders, we need to use modular arithmetic properties to handle this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    # Calculate the initial product of all elements modulo m
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    result = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[left], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
            left += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[right], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
            right -= 1
    
    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- The initial product of all elements modulo `m` is calculated.
- For each command, the product is updated by removing the appropriate element using modular multiplicative inverse (which is calculated using `pow(a, m-2, m)` for a prime `m` or using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for general `m`).

This ensures that the product of the remaining elements is correctly computed after each command.
