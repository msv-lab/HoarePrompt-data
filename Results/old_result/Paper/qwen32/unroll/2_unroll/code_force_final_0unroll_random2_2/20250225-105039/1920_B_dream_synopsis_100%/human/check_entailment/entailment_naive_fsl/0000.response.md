Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the optimal sum after Alice and Bob's moves is flawed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Alice's Moves:**
   - The code sorts the array in descending order and then considers different scenarios where Alice removes `i` elements from the array.
   - However, the code does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice removes elements and Bob flips elements optimally. The logic for updating the sums is incorrect.

2. **Handling of Bob's Moves:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the sum after Bob flips `x` elements, but the logic is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the optimal strategy of Bob flipping the smallest elements after Alice's removals.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
2
3 2 1
-1 2 3
3 2 2
-1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
0
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For the first test case:
  - Alice can remove the element `-1`, leaving `[2, 3]`.
  - Bob can flip `2` to `-2`, resulting in `[-2, 3]` with a sum of `1`.
  - However, a better strategy for Alice is to remove `2`, leaving `[-1, 3]`.
  - Bob can flip `-1` to `1`, resulting in `[1, 3]` with a sum of `4`.
  - The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove `3`, leaving `[-1, 2]`.
  - Bob can flip `-1` to `1`, resulting in `[1, 2]` with a sum of `3`.
  - The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove `-1` and `2`, leaving `[]` with a sum of `0`.
  - The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove `-1` and `3`, leaving `[2]` with a sum of `2`.
