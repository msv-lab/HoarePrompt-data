The provided code snippet only initializes a constant `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. No other variables are affected or modified. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `M`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; Each test case contains integers n, m, and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. For each of the m pairs of friends, the input provides three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i where a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `M` is 1000000007.**
