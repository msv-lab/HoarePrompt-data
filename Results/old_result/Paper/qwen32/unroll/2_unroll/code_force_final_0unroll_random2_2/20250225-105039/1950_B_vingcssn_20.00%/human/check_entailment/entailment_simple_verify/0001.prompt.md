You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

    #State: - The value of `t` and `casos` remains unchanged.
    #   - The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will print a pattern based on the value of `n` read from the input.
    #   - The state of the variables `t` and `casos` is not altered by the loop.
    #
    #Given the above, the output state can be described as follows:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4). It explicitly checks for these values and prints the corresponding checkerboard patterns. However, the problem description states that the input `n` can be as large as 20. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases for `n` within the given range (1 to 20). For example, if the input is `n = 5`, the program will output "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct 10x10 checkerboard pattern. Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
