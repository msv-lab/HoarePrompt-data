Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of subarrays of a palindrome array `a`, `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `0`, `prev` is `0`.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been set to `0`. The other variables (`odds`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
