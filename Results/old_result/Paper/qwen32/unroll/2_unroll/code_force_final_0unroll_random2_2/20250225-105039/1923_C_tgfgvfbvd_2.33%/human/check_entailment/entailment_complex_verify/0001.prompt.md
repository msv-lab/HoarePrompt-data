You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

The loop has finished executing all test cases, and for each query in each test case, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition provided. The variables n, m, l, p, c, a, b, and s are not in a defined state as they are local to the loop iterations and do not persist after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, and the function determines if the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) is at least twice the number of elements in that range. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not return any value explicitly; it outputs the result of each query directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a subarray is "good". A subarray is considered good if there exists another array `b` such that:
1. The sum of elements in `a` (the subarray) is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
2. Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

### Conditions for a Subarray to be "Good"

- **Sum Condition**: The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray. This is because we need to construct another array `b` where each element is different from `a` and positive. If the sum of the subarray is less than twice its length, it is impossible to construct such an array `b` where each element is greater than 0 and different from `a`.
- **Length Condition**: If the subarray has only one element, it cannot be good because we cannot construct an array `b` with a single element that is different from `a` and has a positive sum equal to the sum of `a`.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `c`.
   - It then reads `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `l` and `r`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the prefix sum array `p` for the array `c`. The prefix sum array `p` is used to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the code calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l:r+1]` using the prefix sum array.
   - It checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness of the Code

The code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions derived from the problem statement. Specifically:
- It uses the prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.
- It checks the necessary conditions (sum condition and length condition) to determine if a subarray is good.

### Conclusion

The provided code is correct based on the problem description and the conditions derived from it.

Correctness: **True**
