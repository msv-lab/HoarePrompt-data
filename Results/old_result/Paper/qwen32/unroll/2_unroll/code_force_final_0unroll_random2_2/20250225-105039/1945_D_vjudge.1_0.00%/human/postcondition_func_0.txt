The function reads two integers `n` and `k` (with `1 <= k <= n`) and two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`, where each element is between 1 and 10^9. It calculates and prints the minimum value of the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for `i` ranging from `n - k` to `n - 1`, where `pref` and `soma_b` are computed based on the conditions specified in the code.
