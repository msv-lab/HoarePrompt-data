Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no input arguments. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). The first line of input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the function returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.**
