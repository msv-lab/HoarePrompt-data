Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reading an integer `n` which represents the encoded value of a 3-letter word. The program then tries to determine the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have resulted in this encoded value.

However, there are issues in the logic of the program that make it incorrect. Specifically:

1. The program does not correctly determine the individual letter values based on the sum `n`. It incorrectly uses conditions to check if `lex` is less than 28, 52, or 78, and assigns either 1 or 26 to the array `arr`. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly distribute the sum `n` among the three letters to ensure the smallest possible lexicographical order.

2. The program does not handle the distribution of the sum `n` properly. For example, if `lex` is 24, it should be broken down into three parts such that their sum is 24, and these parts should correspond to the positions of the letters in the alphabet. The current logic does not ensure that the smallest possible letters are chosen.

3. The sorting step after appending the remaining value to `arr` is unnecessary and does not address the core issue of distributing the sum `n` correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Start by assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first two letters.
- Subtract these values from `n` and assign the remaining value to the third letter.
- Ensure that the third letter's value is within the valid range (1 to 26).
- If the third letter's value exceeds 26, increment the second letter and adjust the third letter's value accordingly.
- Continue this process until valid values are found for all three letters.

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded value.

Correctness: **False**
