Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. For each test case, it determines whether "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" should be printed based on the relative positions of the points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` within a grid of dimensions `h` by `w`. The function outputs a result for each test case.**
