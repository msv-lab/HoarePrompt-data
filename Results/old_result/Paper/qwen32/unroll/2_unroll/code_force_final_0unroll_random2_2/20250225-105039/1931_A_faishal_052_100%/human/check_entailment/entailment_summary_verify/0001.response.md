### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it to the problem requirements and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap
Given an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that could have been encoded as `n`. The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

#### Program Analysis

The program's logic for determining the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded word.

2. **Logic to Find the Word**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to fill the first two positions of `arr` with either 1 or 26 based on the value of `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78 (which is always true given the constraints), it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted.
   - The sorted list `arr` is added to `info` for each test case.

3. **Generating the Output**:
   - For each test case, the program constructs a string `temp` by converting each element in `arr` to the corresponding letter using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`.
   - The constructed string is printed.

#### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Logic for Determining Letters**:
  - The program does not correctly determine the smallest possible letters that sum up to `lex`. It incorrectly assigns either 1 or 26 to the first two positions of `arr` without considering the remaining value.
  - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might assign 1 and 26 to the first two positions, leaving 24 - 1 - 26 = -3, which is invalid.
  - The program also sorts `arr`, which is unnecessary and does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word.

- **Flawed Approach**:
  - The program fails to consider the smallest possible values for the first two letters and directly assigns 1 or 26, which does not guarantee the smallest possible word.
  - A correct approach would be to start with the smallest possible value for the first letter, then determine the smallest possible value for the second letter while keeping the sum constraint, and finally assign the remaining value to the third letter.

#### Correct Approach

To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to:
1. Start with the smallest possible value for the first letter (1, which corresponds to 'a').
2. Determine the smallest possible value for the second letter while keeping the sum constraint.
3. The third letter will be the remaining value.

#### Example Fix

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Initialize the smallest possible values for the letters
        a = 1
        b = 1
        c = n - a - b
        # Adjust b and c to be the smallest possible values
        while c > 26:
            b += 1
            c = n - a - b
        # Convert to letters
        word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(word)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the letters are chosen in such a way that they are the smallest possible values while still summing up to `n`.

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified in the program's logic, the original assessment is correct. The program is indeed incorrect.

**Final: False**
