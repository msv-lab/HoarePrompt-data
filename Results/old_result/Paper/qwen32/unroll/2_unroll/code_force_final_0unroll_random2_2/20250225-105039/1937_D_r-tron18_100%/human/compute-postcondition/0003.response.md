The code snippet initializes a list `suffZero` with a single element `0`. This does not affect any of the other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`), which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` equals the length of `s1`, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting with an initial value of `0`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element `0`.**
