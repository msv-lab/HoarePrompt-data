Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, the program only checks if the current element and the previous element can be rearranged to be in non-decreasing order after splitting the previous element, but it does not handle the full transformation and sorting logic required by the problem description.

Let's consider a specific counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
15 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
Here, we can split `15` into `1` and `5`, resulting in the array `[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]`. We can then rearrange the elements to get `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order.

However, the given program will output `NO` for this input. Here's why:

1. The program starts from the end of the array and checks if the current element is smaller than the previous one.
2. When it encounters `2` which is smaller than `15`, it tries to split `15` into `[1, 5]` and checks if `[1, 5, 2]` is sorted, which it is not.
3. Since the check fails, the program incorrectly concludes that it's not possible to sort the array.

Thus, the program does not correctly account for all possible transformations and sorting scenarios as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
