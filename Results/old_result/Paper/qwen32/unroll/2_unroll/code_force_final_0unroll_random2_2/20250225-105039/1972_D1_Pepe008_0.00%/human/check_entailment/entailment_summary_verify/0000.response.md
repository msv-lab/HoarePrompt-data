To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to closely analyze the logic used in the code and verify if it aligns with the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

func()
```

### Function Summary:
The function reads an integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints a specific integer value for each test case based on the formula derived from the input values `a` and `b`.

### Analysis:
The program uses a loop over \(b\) and calculates a value \(x\) for each \(b\). It then sums these values and subtracts 1 from the final sum. The formula used is:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]
where \(i\) ranges from 1 to \(b\).

### Verification:
Let's manually check the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
For \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\):
- Only pair is \((1, 1)\).
- \(a + b = 2\)
- \(\gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\)
- \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\)
- Expected output: 1
- Program output: 1

#### Example 2:
For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- Expected output: 3
- Program output: 3

#### Example 3:
For \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\):
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((3, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- Expected output: 4
- Program output: 4

#### Example 4:
For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\)
- Expected output: 14
- Program output: 14

### Mathematical Derivation:
The formula used in the program seems to be derived based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). For each \(b\), the program calculates the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to produce the correct output for the provided examples. Given that the logic aligns with the problem statement and no counterexamples are found, we can assume the program is correct for all valid inputs within the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the evidence provided.
