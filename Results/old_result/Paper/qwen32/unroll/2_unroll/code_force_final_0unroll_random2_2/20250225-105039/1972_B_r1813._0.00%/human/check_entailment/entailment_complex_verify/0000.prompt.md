You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any direct input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin (facing up or down).
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `input` is assigned the entire input string from standard input; `data` is a list containing all the input values split by whitespace; `index` is 1 + 2*t; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the number of 'U' characters in each string `s`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: - The variables `input`, `data`, `t`, and `index` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    #   - The `results` list is printed completely, with each element ('YES' or 'NO') being printed on a new line.
    #
    #Given the loop only prints the `results` list, the output state will reflect that the `results` have been printed. The other variables retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, and prints "YES" if it is, or "NO" if it is not.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. According to the problem description, if the number of facing-up coins (`num_up_coins`) is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. The provided code correctly counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and checks if it is odd or even. If it is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating Alice's win; if it is even, it appends 'NO', indicating Bob's win. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description and the provided examples. The code also handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the given problem description.
