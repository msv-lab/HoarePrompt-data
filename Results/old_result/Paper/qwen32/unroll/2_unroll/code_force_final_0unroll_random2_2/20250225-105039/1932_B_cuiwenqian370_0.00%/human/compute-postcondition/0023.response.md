Functionality: **The function accepts a list of characters `path`, where each character is either '@' or '*', and returns the maximum number of '@' characters encountered up to any position in the path, excluding positions marked as impossible ('*'). If the path contains no '@' characters or only '*' characters, it returns 0.**
