The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, `test_cases` is `func_1_return_value`. To ensure the loop executes, `func_1_return_value` must be a positive integer.

State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `prices` is a list of n integers representing the prices for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of n integers representing the negative prices for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of n integers representing the bonuses for Bob, `max_profit` is initialized to 0, `current_profit` is initialized to 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` is `func_1_return_value` which must be greater than 0**
