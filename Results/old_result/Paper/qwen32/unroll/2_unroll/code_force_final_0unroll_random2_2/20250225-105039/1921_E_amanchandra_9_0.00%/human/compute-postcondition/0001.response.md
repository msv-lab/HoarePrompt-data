To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does for each set of inputs. The loop reads multiple test cases, each defined by six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`. It then determines the winner of a game based on the positions of `A` and `B` on a grid of dimensions `h` by `w`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the loop:

1. If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw".
2. If `xa <= xb`, it calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`.
3. If `x` is odd:
   - It calculates `l` as the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
   - It calculates `r` as the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
   - It prints "Alice" if `ya` is within the range `[l, r]` adjusted by `x + 1` on both sides; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
4. If `x` is even:
   - It calculates `l` as the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`.
   - It calculates `r` as the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
   - It prints "Bob" if `yb` is within the range `[l, r]` adjusted by `x` on both sides; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The output for each test case is printed on a new line.

Given the initial state and the logic of the loop, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the conditions described above. The state of `t` and the other variables outside the loop (like `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`) remains unchanged, except that their values are used to determine the output for each iteration.

Output State: **t lines, each containing either "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the input values for each test case.**
