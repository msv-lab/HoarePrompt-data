The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Initial State: 
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

Explanation:
The `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
