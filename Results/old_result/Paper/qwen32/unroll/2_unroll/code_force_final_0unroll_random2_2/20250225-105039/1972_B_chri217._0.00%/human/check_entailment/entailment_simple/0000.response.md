### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to understand the winning strategy based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`). The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.

1. **Odd Number of Facing-Up Coins (`num_up % 2 == 1`)**:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring that Bob is always left with an even number of facing-up coins. This is because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by exactly one (since the adjacent coins flip, which doesn't change the parity of the count of facing-up coins). Since the game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the parity alternates with each move, Alice will be the one to make the last move and win.

2. **Even Number of Facing-Up Coins (`num_up % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure that Alice is always left with an even number of facing-up coins. This means that Bob will be the one to make the last move and win.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if the number of `'U'` coins is odd or even and returning `'YES'` if it's odd (indicating Alice's win) and `'NO'` if it's even (indicating Bob's win).

### Correctness:
The program's logic is consistent with the problem's requirements and the provided example cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
