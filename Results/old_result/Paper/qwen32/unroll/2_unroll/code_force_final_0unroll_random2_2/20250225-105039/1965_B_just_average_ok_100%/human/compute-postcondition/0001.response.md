To determine the output state, let's break down the loop and understand what it does for each test case:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - For each test case, the values of `n` and `k` are read.
   - `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).

2. **Finding the Index:**
   - The loop iterates through `nums` to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. This index is stored in `idx`.

3. **Modifying `nums`:**
   - The element at `idx` is removed from `nums`.
   - Three new elements are added to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified `nums` list is printed.
   - The elements of the modified `nums` list are printed.

Since the number of test cases (`t`) is not specified in the problem statement, we can assume that the output state will depend on the specific values of `n` and `k` for each test case. However, we can describe the general output state for a single test case.

Let's assume a single test case with specific values for `n` and `k` to illustrate the output state:

### Example Test Case:
- `n = 10`, `k = 5`
- Initial `nums` list: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]` (up to \(2^{20}\))

### Execution:
1. **Finding the Index:**
   - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 5 is 4 (at index 2).
   - `idx` is set to 2.

2. **Modifying `nums`:**
   - Remove `nums[2]` (which is 4).
   - Add new elements:
     - `5 - 4 = 1` (already exists, so it won't be added again)
     - `5 + 1 = 6`
     - `5 + 4 + 1 = 10`

3. **Final `nums` List:**
   - `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 6, 10]`

### Output:
- Length of `nums`: 12
- Elements of `nums`: `1 2 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 6 10`

### General Output State:
For each test case, the output state will be the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list.

### Final Output State Format:
Given the problem constraints and the described behavior, the output state after all test cases are processed can be described as:

Output State: **For each test case, the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list.**

Since there are `t` test cases, the output will consist of `t` pairs of lines, each pair corresponding to a test case.
