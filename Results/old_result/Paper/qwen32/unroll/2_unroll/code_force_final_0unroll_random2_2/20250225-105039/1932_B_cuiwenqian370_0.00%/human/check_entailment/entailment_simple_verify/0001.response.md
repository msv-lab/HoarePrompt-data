Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` appears to be designed to solve a different problem related to a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the periodicities of the signs.

Let's review the problem requirements and the provided code:

### Problem Requirements:
1. For each test case, read the number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a_i`.
2. Initialize the current year to 0.
3. For each sign, find the next occurrence year after the current year.
4. Update the current year to this next occurrence year.
5. Repeat until all signs have occurred.
6. Output the year in which the last sign occurs.

### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function processes a list of characters (`path`) where each character is either '@' or '*'. It calculates a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to find the maximum number of '@' characters encountered up to each position in the path, excluding positions marked as impossible ('*'). This function does not address the problem of finding the occurrence years of signs based on their periodicities.
  
- **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` with the path (which is actually a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs). It then prints the results from `func_1`. However, since `func_1` is not solving the correct problem, the results are incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
1. For each test case, read the number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a_i`.
2. Initialize the current year to 0.
3. For each sign, find the next occurrence year after the current year by iterating through multiples of the sign's periodicity until finding the first one greater than the current year.
4. Update the current year to this next occurrence year.
5. Repeat until all signs have occurred.
6. Output the year in which the last sign occurs.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
