Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in `arr` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing stick lengths. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4, where `freq` is a dictionary that presumably counts the frequency of each stick length across all test cases.**
