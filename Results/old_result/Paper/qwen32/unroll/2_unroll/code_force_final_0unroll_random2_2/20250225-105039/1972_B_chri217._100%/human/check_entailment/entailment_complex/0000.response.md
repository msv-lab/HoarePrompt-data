Reasoning:  
The problem specifies that Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine if Alice, who goes first, can win if both players play optimally.

The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ("U") determines the winner. If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice can always make the last move and win. If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob can always make the last move and win. This is because each move reduces the number of "U" coins by one, and the player who faces an even number of "U" coins at the start of their turn will always leave an odd number for the opponent, and vice versa.

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: Reads the input and returns a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing the number of coins and the string representing the coins.
2. `func_2`: For each test case, it counts the number of "U" coins and returns "YES" if the count is odd (indicating Alice wins) or "NO" if the count is even (indicating Bob wins).

Both functions work correctly according to the problem's requirements. `func_1` correctly parses the input, and `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
