t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and l is a list of n * n integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for each i in the range of n * n. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 25 * 10^4.
