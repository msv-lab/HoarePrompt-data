You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of lists containing only the characters '0' and '1'. Each grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1 (i.e., it consists of more than one '1').
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())

    #State: t test cases each resulting in the output 'SQUARE'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an `n x n` grid of '0's and '1's. For each grid, it determines whether the shape formed by the '1's is a triangle or a square, with the shape size being greater than 1, and prints the type of shape.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly identifies whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a square or a triangle.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Square Shape**: 
   - Consists of `k` (k > 1) consecutive rows, each with `k` consecutive '1's.
   - The '1's are aligned such that they form a perfect square.

2. **Triangle Shape**:
   - Consists of `k` (k > 1) consecutive rows.
   - The i-th row has `2*i - 1` consecutive '1's.
   - The central '1's are aligned in a single column.
   - An upside-down triangle is also considered valid.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program reads `t` test cases, each with an `n x n` grid. For each test case, it reads `n` lines of the grid and checks the number of '1's in each row.

#### Key Points of the Program:
- If a row has exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
- If a row has more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.
- After processing all rows, it prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is not zero (i.e., if any row had exactly one '1'), otherwise it prints 'SQUARE'.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Triangle Detection**:
   - The program only checks if a row has exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, specifically `2*i - 1` '1's in the i-th row.
   
2. **Square Detection**:
   - The program only checks if a row has more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. This is incorrect because a square requires each of the `k` rows to have exactly `k` '1's, and all rows must have the same number of '1's aligned in a square shape.

3. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to check for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square. It incorrectly assumes that the presence of a row with one '1' or more than one '1' is sufficient to determine the shape.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a square or a triangle. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
