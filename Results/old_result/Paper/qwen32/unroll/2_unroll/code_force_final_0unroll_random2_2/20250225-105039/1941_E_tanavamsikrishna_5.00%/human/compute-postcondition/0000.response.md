The code snippet provided updates the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` by reading input values and converting them to integers. The initial state mentions that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, and `rows` is a 2D list. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` will be updated to the values provided in the input, while `rows` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the values provided in the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers in each sublist being 0.**
