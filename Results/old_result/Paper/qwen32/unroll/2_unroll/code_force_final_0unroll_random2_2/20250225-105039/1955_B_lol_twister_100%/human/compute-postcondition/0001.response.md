The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `li`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, or `a`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the creation of an empty list `li`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is an empty list.**
