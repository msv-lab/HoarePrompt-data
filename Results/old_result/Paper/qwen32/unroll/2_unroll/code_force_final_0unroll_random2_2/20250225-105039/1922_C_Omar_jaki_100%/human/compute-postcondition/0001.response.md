Output State: **`t` is the integer value read from the input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each of the `m` queries, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**

Natural Language: The variable `t` has been assigned the integer value read from the input. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) and their constraints remain as specified in the initial state. The lambda function `r` is still defined to read and process input lines.
