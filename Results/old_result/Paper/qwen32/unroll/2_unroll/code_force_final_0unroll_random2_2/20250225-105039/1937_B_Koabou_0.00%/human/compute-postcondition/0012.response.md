Let's break down the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variable `s`**:
   - It is constructed based on a condition involving the lists `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
   - If there exists an index `i` where `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`.
   - If no such `i` exists, `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, where `n` is the length of `a[1]`.

2. **Variable `x`**:
   - It is the index `i` where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'` is met.
   - If no such `i` exists, `x` is `n - 1`.

3. **Variable `t`**:
   - It is either `1` or `x - i + 1` where the loop breaks.
   - Given the construction of `x`, it seems that `t` will be `1` if no such `i` is found, or `x - i + 1` if `i` is found and the loop breaks at that point.

Given these conditions, we need to determine the value of `t` and what is printed.

### Case Analysis:

- **Case 1: No such `i` is found**:
  - `x` will be `n - 1`.
  - The loop breaks without finding an `i` that meets the condition, so `t` is set to `1`.
  - Output: **1**

- **Case 2: An `i` is found**:
  - `x` is the index `i` where `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`.
  - The loop breaks at this point, and `t` is set to `x - i + 1`.
  - Since `x` is `i` in this case, `t` simplifies to `i - i + 1`, which is `1`.
  - Output: **1**

In both cases, the value of `t` is `1`. Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
