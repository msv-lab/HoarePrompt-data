Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum final score as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program and why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`2n`) and the list of integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is crucial because to maximize the score, we should always try to pair the smallest available numbers first. By sorting the list in ascending order, we ensure that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest available numbers at each step), calculates their minimum, and adds this minimum to the score. This process is repeated `n` times until all numbers are paired and removed from the list.

4. **Output**: After processing each test case, the program prints the calculated score.

The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement. It ensures that the score is maximized by always choosing the smallest available numbers for pairing, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem.

No edge cases were found where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
