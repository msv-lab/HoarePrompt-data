Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The loop has finished executing all test cases, and for each query in each test case, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition provided. The variables n, m, l, p, c, a, b, and s are not in a defined state as they are local to the loop iterations and do not persist after the loop completes.**
