You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, balance is 0, details is a list of tuples (balance, -i, char) for each character in s.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Program Analysis

The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the input, calculates the prefix balance for each character, and then sorts these characters based on the prefix balance and position. Finally, it constructs the result by joining the characters in the sorted order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads a string `s` from the input.
2. **Calculating Prefix Balance**:
   - It initializes `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the `balance` (incrementing for '(', decrementing for ')').
   - It appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the list `details`. The `-i` ensures that ties in balance are broken by position in decreasing order.
3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `details` is sorted based on the prefix balance and position.
4. **Constructing Result**:
   - It constructs the result string by joining the characters in the sorted list `details`.

### Verification Against Problem Description

The problem requires that the balanced shuffle operation produces a new parentheses sequence where the prefix balance is non-negative at every step and the final balance is 0. The program achieves this by:

- Correctly calculating the prefix balance for each character.
- Sorting the characters based on the prefix balance and position, ensuring that ties in balance are broken by position in decreasing order.
- Constructing the result by joining the characters in the sorted order, which guarantees a non-negative prefix balance at every step.

### Testing Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases to ensure the program works correctly:

1. **Simple Balanced Sequence**: `()`
   - Prefix balance: `[0, -1]`
   - Sorted: `[0, -1]`
   - Result: `()`
   
2. **Balanced Sequence with Multiple Pairs**: `(()())`
   - Prefix balance: `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, -1]`
   - Sorted: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1]`
   - Result: `()()()`

3. **Balanced Sequence with Nested Pairs**: `((()))`
   - Prefix balance: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
   - Sorted: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Result: `()(())`

4. **Balanced Sequence with Complex Nesting**: `(()(()))`
   - Prefix balance: `[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
   - Sorted: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Result: `()(()())`

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing of the program, it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The program handles various edge cases and produces the correct result for each of them.

Correctness: **True**.
