The code snippet `cases = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. This variable will now hold the number of test cases, which was previously described as `t` in the initial state. The value of `t` is now replaced by the value of `cases` as read from the input. The precondition for `n` in each test case remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, and for each of the `cases` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 78.**
