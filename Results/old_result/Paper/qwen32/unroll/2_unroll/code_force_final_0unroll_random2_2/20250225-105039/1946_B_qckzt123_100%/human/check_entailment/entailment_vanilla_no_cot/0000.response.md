To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step by step.

**Problem Analysis:**

Given an array `a` of `n` integers, and `k` operations, in each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of `a`, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in `a`. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` such operations, and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Key Observations:**
1. **Maximizing the Sum:** To maximize the sum, we should focus on adding the largest possible subarray sum repeatedly.
2. **Subarray Sum:** The largest subarray sum can be found using Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in linear time.
3. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum:** Once we have the maximum subarray sum, each operation can effectively double this sum by adding it to the array. This is because we can strategically place the sum to maximize its contribution to the overall array sum.
4. **Modulo Operation:** Since the sums can become very large, we take the results modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required.

**Program Analysis:**

Let's break down the provided program:
1. **Reading Input:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.
2. **Sum Calculation:** It calculates the sum `s` of the array `a`.
3. **Kadane's Algorithm:** It uses a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum `t`.
4. **Initial Answer:** The initial answer `ans` is computed as `(s + t) % MOD`.
5. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum:** For `k-1` operations, it doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to `ans`, taking modulo `MOD` at each step to prevent overflow.
6. **Output:** The final answer is printed for each test case.

**Conclusion:**

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations and handles the modulo operation as required. The use of Kadane's algorithm ensures that the maximum subarray sum is efficiently computed.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.
