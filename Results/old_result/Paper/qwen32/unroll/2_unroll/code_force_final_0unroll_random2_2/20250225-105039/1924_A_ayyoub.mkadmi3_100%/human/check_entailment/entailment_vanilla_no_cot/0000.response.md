Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`. The logic inside the function is flawed and does not properly track the subsequences.

2. The logic for generating the missing string when the answer is "NO" is incorrect. The program only checks for the first missing character and repeats it to fill the remaining length, which does not guarantee that the generated string is the shortest one that does not appear as a subsequence.

3. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where `n` is greater than `k`. For example, if `n` is 3 and `k` is 2, the program should check for all possible combinations of "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb", not just the presence of single characters.

4. The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is 1. It should simply check if all characters from 'a' to 'k' are present in `s`.

To solve the problem correctly, a different approach is needed, such as generating all possible strings of length `n` and checking if each one is a subsequence of `s`. If a string is not found, it should be returned as the missing string. This approach can be optimized using dynamic programming or other techniques to handle the constraints efficiently.
