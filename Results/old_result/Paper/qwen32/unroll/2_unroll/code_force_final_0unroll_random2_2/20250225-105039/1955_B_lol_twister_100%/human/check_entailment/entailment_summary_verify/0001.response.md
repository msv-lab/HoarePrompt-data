Let's analyze the given program and the problem description to verify the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to determine if a given list of \( n^2 \) integers can be rearranged to form a specific \( n \times n \) matrix (progressive square) constructed using the formula:
\[ a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \]

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case:
1. It reads \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
2. It reads a list of \( n^2 \) integers \( l \).
3. It calls `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to check if the list can form the progressive square.

The `func_1` function:
1. Finds the minimum value in the list \( l \) and assumes it to be \( a_{1,1} \).
2. Constructs a list \( li \) with the expected values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for all \( k \) and \( h \) in the range \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
3. Sorts both the provided list \( l \) and the constructed list \( li \).
4. Compares the sorted lists. If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Function Summary
The function `func_1` checks if the list `l` can be rearranged to match a specific sequence generated by starting from the minimum value in `l` and incrementing by `c` and `d` in a grid-like fashion. It returns 'yes' if the list can be rearranged to match this sequence, otherwise it returns 'no'.

### Verification
The logic in `func_1` seems correct in terms of constructing the expected progressive square and comparing it with the provided list. However, there is a subtle issue with the assumption that the minimum value in the list \( l \) is always \( a_{1,1} \). The problem statement does not guarantee that the minimum value in the list is the starting value \( a_{1,1} \). Instead, \( a_{1,1} \) is a specific value that needs to be determined based on the rules of the progressive square.

### Correctness Challenge
The key issue here is that the program assumes the minimum value in the list is \( a_{1,1} \), which might not be the case. For example, consider a scenario where the list contains values that do not start from the minimum value but still form a valid progressive square. The program would incorrectly identify such a list as invalid.

### Example
Let's consider a test case:
- \( n = 3 \), \( c = 2 \), \( d = 3 \)
- List: \( [4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11, 10, 12, 14] \)

The progressive square for \( a_{1,1} = 4 \) is:
\[ \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 6 & 8 \\ 7 & 9 & 11 \\ 10 & 12 & 14 \end{bmatrix} \]

The minimum value in the list is 4, which is correctly assumed as \( a_{1,1} \). However, if the list was:
- List: \( [6, 8, 10, 9, 11, 13, 12, 14, 16] \)

The progressive square for \( a_{1,1} = 4 \) is the same, but the minimum value in the list is 6. The program would incorrectly assume 6 as \( a_{1,1} \) and generate an incorrect progressive square.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is incorrect because the program incorrectly assumes the minimum value in the list is \( a_{1,1} \). The correct approach would involve checking all possible starting values for \( a_{1,1} \) and verifying if the list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

Final: **False**
