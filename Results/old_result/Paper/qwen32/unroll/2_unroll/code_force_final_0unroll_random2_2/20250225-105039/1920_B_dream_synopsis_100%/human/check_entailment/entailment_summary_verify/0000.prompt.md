You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible sum after performing specific operations involving the elements of `a` and the values of `k` and `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the optimal sum after Alice and Bob's moves is flawed.

Here’s a detailed explanation of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Alice's Moves:**
   - The code sorts the array in descending order and then considers different scenarios where Alice removes `i` elements from the array.
   - However, the code does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice removes elements and Bob flips elements optimally. The logic for updating the sums is incorrect.

2. **Handling of Bob's Moves:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the sum after Bob flips `x` elements, but the logic is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the optimal strategy of Bob flipping the smallest elements after Alice's removals.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
2
3 2 1
-1 2 3
3 2 2
-1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
0
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For the first test case:
  - Alice can remove the element `-1`, leaving `[2, 3]`.
  - Bob can flip `2` to `-2`, resulting in `[-2, 3]` with a sum of `1`.
  - However, a better strategy for Alice is to remove `2`, leaving `[-1, 3]`.
  - Bob can flip `-1` to `1`, resulting in `[1, 3]` with a sum of `4`.
  - The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove `3`, leaving `[-1, 2]`.
