### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next only after she has bought as many jewels as possible at the current stall.

#### Key Points:
- **Constraints**:
  - Number of test cases: `1 <= t <= 1000`
  - Coins Alice has: `1 <= n <= 10^18`
  - Jewels Alice wants to buy: `1 <= k <= 10^18`
  - Maximum number of stalls: `60`
  - Price per jewel: `1 <= price <= 10^18`

- **Requirement**:
  - Determine if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - If possible, output "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices for each stall.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:

#### Input Reading:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values `n` and `k`.

#### Logic in `func_1(n, k)`:
- **Base Case 1**: If `n == k`, it prints "YES", the number of stalls as `1`, and the price as `1`. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if the price per jewel is `1`.
  
- **Base Case 2**: If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

- **General Case**:
  - The program sets up a list `costs` with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
  - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall and subtracting the corresponding amount of coins from `n`.
  - The variable `h` keeps track of the total number of jewels Alice buys.
  - If `h < k`, it prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, it prints "YES" along with the number of stalls and the prices.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The program only considers two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`), which is not sufficient to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program might calculate `costs` as `[8, 1]`, and Alice would buy `1` jewel at the first stall and `9` jewels at the second stall, totaling `10` jewels, which is incorrect.
- The program does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought equals `k` for arbitrary values of `n` and `k`.
- The program does not utilize the maximum number of stalls (60) effectively to achieve the desired outcome.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program only considers two prices and does not adjust the prices dynamically based on the remaining coins and jewels needed.
- The annotations also show that the program does not handle cases where more than two stalls are required to achieve the exact number of jewels `k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. It fails to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all cases, especially when `n` and `k` are large and require more than two stalls with carefully chosen prices.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
