You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 1 4
    
    3 3 2 3
    
    4 2
    
    2 1 1 1
    
    4 2 3 2
    
    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` processes multiple test cases to determine the maximum profit Alice can achieve by selecting items based on their negative prices and bonuses, while considering a limit `k` on the number of items she can initially select. It prints the maximum profit for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program for correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis:

The program is designed to compute Alice's profit in a game where she buys items and sells some of them to Bob. The goal is to maximize Alice's profit, and Bob's strategy minimizes it.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob can take for free `k`.
   - It then reads two lists: `prices` (cost for Alice) and `bonuses` (Bob's payment).

2. **Combining and Sorting:**
   - The program combines the `prices` and `bonuses` into a list of tuples `combined`, where each tuple is `(-price, bonus)`.
   - The list is sorted based on the `bonus` value.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is used to keep track of the `k` items with the highest `bonus - price` values.
   - The program pushes the first `k` items from the sorted list into the heap.

4. **Calculating Profit:**
   - The program calculates the initial profit from the `k` items in the heap.
   - It then iterates through the remaining items in the sorted list, updating the profit by considering the potential gain from each item and the loss from the item that would be removed from the heap.

5. **Updating Maximum Profit:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during the process.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program uses a heap to keep track of the `k` items with the highest `bonus - price` values. However, the initial heap is not correctly initialized. It should contain the `k` items with the highest `bonus - price` values, but the current implementation just takes the first `k` items from the sorted list, which might not be the optimal choice.

2. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses `heapq.heappushpop` to maintain the heap size `k`. However, the logic for updating the profit might not be correct. Specifically, the profit should be updated based on the `bonus - price` values of the items being added and removed from the heap.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the edge cases where `k` is 0 or `n` is equal to `k`. It should correctly handle these cases by either taking all items or none of them.

### Example Case:

Let's consider an example to illustrate the potential issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2
1 2 1
3 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Current Output:**
The program might not correctly handle this case because the initial heap is not initialized with the `k` items with the highest `bonus - price` values.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly the initialization of the heap and the calculation of profit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The program's logic for initializing the heap and updating the profit is flawed. It does not ensure that the heap always contains the `k` items with the highest `bonus - price` values, which is necessary for Alice to maximize her profit. Additionally, it does not correctly handle edge cases where `k` is 0 or `n` is equal to `k`.
