Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the total number of tickets purchased does not exceed `k` and does not correctly account for the price increases on subsequent days.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        t = 0
        s = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
        print(int(c))
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Price Increase Logic**: The code increases the price for all subsequent days by the number of tickets purchased on the current day. However, the loop does not correctly handle the fact that once `k` tickets are purchased, it should stop purchasing further tickets.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**: The variable `k` is decremented by `s` in each iteration, but the loop continues for all `n` days. This means that even if `k` becomes 0, the loop will still continue, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Stopping Condition**: The loop should stop as soon as `k` tickets are purchased. Currently, it continues iterating over all days, which can result in incorrect calculations.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:

```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

The correct output is `10`, as explained in the problem statement. Let's see how the program handles this:

- The prices are sorted: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
- On the first day, it will buy `min(2, 3) = 2` tickets at a cost of `2 * (2 + 0) = 4`. The price for subsequent days increases by 2: `[4, 6, 8]`.
- On the second day, it will buy `min(2, 1) = 1` ticket at a cost of `1 * (4 + 2) = 6`. The price for subsequent days increases by 1: `[6, 8]`.
- On the third and fourth days, it will not buy any tickets because `k` is already 0.

The total cost is `4 + 6 = 10`, which is correct.

However, consider another test case:

```
1
4 2 8
8 6 4 2
```

The correct output is `64`. Let's see how the program handles this:

- The prices are sorted: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
- On the first day, it will buy `min(2, 8) = 2` tickets at a cost of `2 * (2 + 0) = 4`. The price for subsequent days increases by 2: `[4, 6, 8]`.
- On the second day, it will buy `min(2, 6) = 2` tickets at a cost of `2 * (4 + 2) = 12`. The price for subsequent days increases by 2: `[6, 8]`.
- On the third day, it will buy `min(2, 4) = 2` tickets at a cost of `2 * (6 + 4) = 20`. The price for subsequent days increases by 2: `[8]`.
- On the fourth day, it will buy `min(2, 2) = 2` tickets at a cost of `2 * (8 + 6) = 28`.

The total cost is `4 + 12 + 20 + 28 = 64`, which is correct.

However, the issue arises when `k` is not a multiple of `m` and the remaining tickets are less than `m` on the last day. The program does not handle this correctly because it continues to iterate over all days even if `k` is already 0.

### Corrected Example:
Consider the following test case:

```
1
4 3 5
8 6 4 2
```

The correct output is `12`. Let's see how the program handles this:

- The prices are sorted: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
- On the first day, it will buy `min(3, 5) = 3` tickets at a cost of `3 * (2 + 0) = 6`. The price for subsequent days increases by 3: `[5, 7, 9]`.
- On the second day, it will buy `min(3, 2) = 2` tickets at a cost of `2 * (5 + 3) = 16`. The price for subsequent days increases by 2: `[7, 9]`.

The total cost is `6 + 16 = 22`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be:

- On the first day, buy `min(3, 5) = 3` tickets at a cost of `3 * (2 + 0) = 6`. The price for subsequent days increases by 3: `[5, 7, 9]`.
- On the second day, buy `min(3, 2) = 2` tickets at a cost of `2 * (5 + 3) = 16`. The price for subsequent days increases by 2: `[7, 9]`.

The correct output should be `6 + 6 = 12`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the scenario where `k` is not a multiple of `m` and the remaining tickets are less than `m` on the last day. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
