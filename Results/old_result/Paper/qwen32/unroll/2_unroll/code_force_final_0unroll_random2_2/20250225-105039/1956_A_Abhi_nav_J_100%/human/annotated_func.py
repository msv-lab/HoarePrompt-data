#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k integers where 1 <= k <= 100, a is strictly increasing (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k), and each element in a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100. b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100, and each element in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns list 'b' which contains q integers where 1 <= q <= 100, and each element in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `a`, a strictly increasing list of integers, and `b`, a list of integers. It returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.
