The code snippet `nodes = defaultdict(list)` changes the `nodes` variable from a dictionary to a `defaultdict` of lists. This means that if a key does not exist in `nodes`, it will automatically be initialized to an empty list when accessed.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer representing a node and the value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`.**

In natural language: The `nodes` variable is now a `defaultdict` of lists, while all other variables retain their initial values.
