The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables and their preconditions remain unchanged as the code only modifies `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10, and the grid is an `n` x `n` list of lists containing only the characters '0' and '1'. Each grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1 (i.e., it consists of more than one '1').**
