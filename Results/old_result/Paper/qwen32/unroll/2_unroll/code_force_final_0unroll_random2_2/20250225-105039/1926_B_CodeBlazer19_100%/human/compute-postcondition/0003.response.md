Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid consisting of '0's and '1's. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square made up of '1's with a size greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') for each test case.**
