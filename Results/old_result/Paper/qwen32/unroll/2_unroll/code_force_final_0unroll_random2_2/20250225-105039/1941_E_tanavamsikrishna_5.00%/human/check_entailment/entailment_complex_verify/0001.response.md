### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment in detail.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`:
The goal of `func_1` is to calculate the minimum cost to install supports in a single row, adhering to the constraint that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

- **First Loop**: `for i in range(0, d - 1): row[i] = row[i] + 1`
  - This loop increments the first `d-1` elements by 1. This step is correct as it ensures that supports are installed at the first `d-1` positions with the required cost.
  
- **Second Loop**: `for i in range(d - 1, len(row)): row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1`
  - This loop is intended to ensure that each subsequent support is placed with the minimum cost, considering the previous `d` positions. However, there are two issues:
    1. The range `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` is incorrect. It should consider the range `row[max(0, i - d):i]` to ensure that only the previous `d` positions are considered.
    2. The `if i > 0 else 0` condition is unnecessary because `row[max(0, i - d):i]` will naturally handle the edge case when `i` is less than `d`.

The correct implementation of `func_1` should be:
```python
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = min(row[max(0, i - d):i]) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]
```

#### Function `func_2()`:
- This function reads the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
- It reads the grid of river depths.
- It applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of placing supports in that row.
- It calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

The logic in `func_2()` is correct once `func_1` is corrected. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost for placing `k` consecutive bridges.

### Issues:
- The implementation of `func_1` is incorrect due to the incorrect range in the second loop. The range should be `row[max(0, i - d):i]` instead of `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the implementation of `func_1`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
