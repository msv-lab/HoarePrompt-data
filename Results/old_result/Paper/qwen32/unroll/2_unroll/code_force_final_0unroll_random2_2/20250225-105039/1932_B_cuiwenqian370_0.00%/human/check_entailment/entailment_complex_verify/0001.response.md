Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs, and the signs must occur sequentially.
   - The correct approach involves iterating through each sign, finding the next occurrence year after the current year, and updating the current year to this next occurrence year.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` appears to be designed to find the maximum number of '@' characters in a path with '@' and '*' characters, excluding positions marked as impossible ('*'). This is unrelated to the problem at hand.
   - `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases, but it uses `func_1` to process each test case. Since `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, `func_2` also does not solve the problem correctly.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations describe the behavior of `func_1` accurately. It processes a list of '@' and '*' characters and computes the maximum number of '@' characters encountered up to any position, excluding positions marked as impossible.
   - The annotations for `func_2` indicate that it processes input and calls `func_1` for each test case, but this does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not implement the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on their periodicities.
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the problem.

Final: **False**
