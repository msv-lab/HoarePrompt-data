To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the structure of the `permutation` list and how it is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **permutation**: This list is filled in a specific pattern where each `i`th value of `curr_v` starts filling from the `i`-th position and fills every `k`-th position thereafter.
2. **idx**: This variable remains 0. It seems to be an index but is not used in the provided description of the `permutation` list construction.
3. **idx_v**: This variable remains 1. Similar to `idx`, it seems to be an index but is not used in the provided description.
4. **curr_v**: This variable starts at `n + 1`. It seems to be the current value being placed in the `permutation` list.
5. **result**: This is a string that contains the space-separated values of the `permutation` list.

### Understanding the Pattern:
Given the description, it sounds like a circular permutation (or a cyclic permutation) is being constructed, where each value `curr_v` is placed starting from the `i`-th position and then every `k`-th position thereafter. However, since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the pattern in a general way.

### Constructing the `permutation` List:
- The list `permutation` is filled in a specific pattern, but the exact pattern is not fully described in the initial state.
- `curr_v` starts at `n + 1` and is used to fill the list in a cyclic manner.
- `result` is a string that represents the `permutation` list with space-separated values.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values in the `permutation` list. However, we can describe the structure of the output.

### Output Description:
The `print(result)` statement will print a space-separated string of values from the `permutation` list. The exact values depend on the specific pattern defined by `n` and `k`, which are not provided.

### Final Answer:
Output: **result (where result is a space-separated string of values from the permutation list, constructed following the specific pattern defined by n and k)**
