Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine which letter, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in each of the given strings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's behavior:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5.
3. It initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero. `l` is intended to count the occurrences of 'A', and `h` is intended to count the occurrences of 'B'.
4. The program then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is 'A', it increments `l`. Otherwise, it increments `h`.
5. After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares the two counters:
   - If `l` (the count of 'A') is greater than `h` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

The logic correctly identifies the most frequent character in each string. However, the program does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. According to the problem statement, if the counts are equal, the program should print either 'A' or 'B', but it will print 'B' in this case. Since the problem statement does not specify a preference for one over the other in the event of a tie, and the provided output matches the behavior of the program, the program can be considered correct based on the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
