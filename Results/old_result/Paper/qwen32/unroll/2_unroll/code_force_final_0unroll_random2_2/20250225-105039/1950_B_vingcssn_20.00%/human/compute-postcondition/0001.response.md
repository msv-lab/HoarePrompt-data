To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `c` and `casos`. The loop will execute if `casos` is greater than 0, as `c` starts at 0 and increments up to, but does not include, `casos`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 20, and `casos` is equal to `t`. Since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 20, `casos` will also be in this range, ensuring that the loop will execute.

The variable `c` is initialized to 0 in the `range(0, casos)` function, so we don't need to adjust its initial state.

Therefore, the state does not need to be modified for the loop to execute, as long as `casos` (which is equal to `t`) is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 20, `casos` is equal to `t`, `c` is 0**
