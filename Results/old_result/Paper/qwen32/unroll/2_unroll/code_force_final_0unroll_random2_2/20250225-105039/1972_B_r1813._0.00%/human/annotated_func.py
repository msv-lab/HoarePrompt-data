#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any direct input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin (facing up or down).
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `input` is assigned the entire input string from standard input; `data` is a list containing all the input values split by whitespace; `index` is 1 + 2*t; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the number of 'U' characters in each string `s`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: - The variables `input`, `data`, `t`, and `index` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    #   - The `results` list is printed completely, with each element ('YES' or 'NO') being printed on a new line.
    #
    #Given the loop only prints the `results` list, the output state will reflect that the `results` have been printed. The other variables retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, and prints "YES" if it is, or "NO" if it is not.
