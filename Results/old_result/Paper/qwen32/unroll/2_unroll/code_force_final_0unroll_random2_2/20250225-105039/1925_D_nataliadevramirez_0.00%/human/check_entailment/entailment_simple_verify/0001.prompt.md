You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, and return the result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \), where \( \frac{p}{q} \) is the expected value expressed as a fraction in simplest form.

2. **Key Points**:
   - There are \( n \) children and \( m \) pairs of friends.
   - Each friend pair has an initial friendship value.
   - For each of the \( k \) excursions, a pair of children is chosen randomly.
   - If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all chosen pairs.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - For each friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen in \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \), because there are \( \binom{n}{2} \) possible pairs.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen, starting from its initial value.
   - The expected contribution of a friend pair to the total sum is the sum of the expected values of its friendship value over the \( k \) excursions.
   - The expected friendship value after \( x \) excursions for a pair with initial value \( f \) is \( f + \frac{x(x+1)}{2 \binom{n}{2}} \).

4. **Simplification**:
   - The problem simplifies to calculating the sum of the expected contributions of all friend pairs.
   - The expected contribution of a single friend pair can be calculated as \( f \cdot k + \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Since the problem asks for the result modulo \( 10^9+7 \), we need to handle the division carefully by using modular inverses.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the expected contribution of all friend pairs.
   - It sums up \( f \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) for all friend pairs.
   - The term \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) is calculated once and used for all friend pairs.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the result.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Missing Modular Inverse**:
   - The program does not account for the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \) in the expected value calculation.
   - The correct expected contribution of a friend pair should be \( f \cdot k + \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) needs to be calculated using the modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the expected value by not including the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \).

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \) in the expected value calculation.
