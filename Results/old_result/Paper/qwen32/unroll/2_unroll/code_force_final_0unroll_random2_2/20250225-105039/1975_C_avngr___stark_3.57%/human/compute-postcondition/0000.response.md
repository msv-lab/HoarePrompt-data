Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The initial state for the array `a` and its length `n` for each test case is not yet defined.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The values for `n` and the array `a` for each test case are still to be read from the input.
