### Reasoning

Let's break down the provided program and the annotations to evaluate its correctness against the problem description.

#### Problem Recap
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
- If not, we need to provide one such string that is not a subsequence.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function is intended to help determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English letters.
   - It iterates over the string `s`, and for each character, if it is in the alphabet set, it removes the character from the set.
   - If the set becomes empty, it resets the set and appends the character to `s2`.
   - It constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the alphabet set.
   - It then checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a boolean indicating this, along with `s1` and `s2`.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations state that `s1` is the same as `s`, `s2` contains the last `k-1` characters of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The final return statement checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a tuple containing a boolean, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function's logic is flawed. It does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. Instead, it checks if the string `s` contains all `k` characters enough times.
   - The function does not account for the order of characters or the requirement that all combinations of length `n` must be subsequences.

2. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The logic used to construct a missing subsequence is incorrect. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using that character.
   - This approach does not ensure that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

#### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect. The logic in `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`, and the logic to construct a missing subsequence is flawed.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
