You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The grasshopper starts at the top-left cell (1, 1) and can only move right or down. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string formed by the cells in the path from (1, 1) to (2, n) and the number of such paths that produce this smallest string.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Path Generation**:
   - The grasshopper can either stay in the first row or switch to the second row at any point.
   - We need to explore all possible paths and determine the lexicographically smallest one.
   
2. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - A string `s` is lexicographically smaller than another string `t` if at the first differing position, `s` has a smaller character.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - Once the smallest string is found, we need to count how many different paths can produce this string.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided code to see if it addresses these points correctly:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
        x = n - 1
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
    print(s, sep='')
    print(t)
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **Path Selection**:
   - The program seems to attempt to find a switch point from the first row to the second row, but the logic is flawed.
   - It does not correctly handle the case where the smallest string starts with '1' in the first row and continues in the second row.

2. **String Construction**:
   - The string `s` is constructed based on a specific condition, but it does not guarantee that it is the smallest possible string.
   - The program does not explore all possible paths to find the smallest lexicographical string.

3. **Path Counting**:
   - The path counting logic is incorrect.
   - The variable `t` is intended to count the number of paths that produce the smallest string, but the logic is flawed and does not correctly count all such paths.

### Conclusion

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to explore all possible paths and does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest string or the number of paths that produce it.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not guarantee finding the lexicographically smallest string or counting all paths that produce it.  
Correctness: **False**
