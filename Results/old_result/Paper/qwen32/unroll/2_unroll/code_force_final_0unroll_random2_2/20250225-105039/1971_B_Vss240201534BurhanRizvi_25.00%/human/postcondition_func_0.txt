The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string `s`, it checks if a shuffled version of `s` is different from `s` itself. If they differ, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string; otherwise, it prints "No". The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
