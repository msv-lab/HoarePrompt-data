You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required. The logic in the program seems flawed, particularly in how it handles the grouping of numbers based on their bit representations.

Here is a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Bitwise Operation**: The program uses `s = i ^ check` where `check = 2 ** 31 - 1` (which is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1). The XOR operation here seems to be intended to flip the bits of the number, but the subsequent logic does not correctly handle the grouping based on the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Grouping Logic**: The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the numbers and their complements, but the logic for reducing the number of groups (`ans`) is not correct. Specifically, the condition `if s in dic` and the subsequent decrement of `ans` do not correctly reflect the problem's requirement that no two numbers in the same group can have matching bits from 1st to 31st.

3. **Incorrect Output Timing**: The program prints the answer (`ans`) inside the loop that processes each number, which is incorrect. The answer should be printed only after processing all numbers in a test case.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases such as all numbers being the same or having no common bits correctly.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
1 2 4
```
The expected output is `1` because the binary representations of `1`, `2`, and `4` are `001`, `010`, and `100` respectively, and they can all be placed in the same group since they do not share any common bits from 1st to 31st.

However, the provided program will likely output `3` for this case because it does not correctly handle the grouping logic.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve using a bitmask to check the compatibility of numbers and using a graph-based approach or a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum number of groups required. The provided program does not follow this approach and thus is incorrect.
