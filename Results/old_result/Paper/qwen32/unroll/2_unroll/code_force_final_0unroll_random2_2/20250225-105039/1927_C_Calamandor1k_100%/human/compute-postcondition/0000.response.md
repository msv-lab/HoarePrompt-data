The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) that were mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in `cases` is a tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 <= b_j <= 10^6. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4*10^5; `results` is an empty list.**
