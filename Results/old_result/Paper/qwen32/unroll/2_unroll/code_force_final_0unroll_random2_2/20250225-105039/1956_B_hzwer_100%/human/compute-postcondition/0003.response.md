Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the list at most 2 times. The function returns the results for each test case, which are not specified in detail here, but are implied to be based on the given card values and their occurrences.**
