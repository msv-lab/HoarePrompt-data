### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to decode an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) into a lexicographically smallest 3-letter word.
- The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.
- The sum of the indices of the three letters should equal `n`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and processes each encoded value to determine the lexicographically smallest word. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded value `lex`.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - For each test case, it initializes an array `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop to fill the first two positions of `arr`:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it assigns 1 to the position and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it assigns 26 to the position and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it assigns 26 to the position and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - The third position is filled with the remaining value of `lex`.
   - The array is then sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - The positions are converted to letters and printed.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, including the values assigned to `arr` and the final sorted array.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Flawed Logic for First Two Letters:**
  - The logic for assigning values to the first two positions is flawed. It does not correctly handle the distribution of the encoded value to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
  - For example, if `lex` is 24, it might assign 1, 1, and 22 instead of 1, 1, and 22, which is correct, but the way it handles other values is incorrect.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if `lex` is 55, it might assign values like 26, 26, and 3, which corresponds to "zzc". However, the correct answer should be "czz".

#### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case `lex = 55`:
- The correct assignment should be 3, 26, and 26, which corresponds to "czz".
- The program might assign 26, 26, and 3, which corresponds to "zzc", which is not lexicographically smallest.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the decoding logic to ensure the lexicographically smallest word for all possible encoded values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**.
