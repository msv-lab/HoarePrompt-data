To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the given loop and the variables involved. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `path` is a string of space-separated integers.
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of signs.
   - `data` is a list of strings where each string is an integer from `path`.
   - `t` is the integer value of the first element of `data`.
   - `index` is 1.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
     - `index` is incremented by 1.
     - `path` is updated to `data[index]`.
     - `index` is incremented by 1.
     - `results` is appended with the result of `func_1(path)`.

3. **Post-Loop State:**
   - After `t` iterations, `index` will have been incremented by 2 for each iteration, so `index` will be `1 + 2*t`.
   - `results` will contain the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration.

Given the above, the output state after the loop has finished executing will be:

- `path` will hold the value of `data[index]` from the last iteration.
- `n` will hold the value of `data[index-1]` from the last iteration.
- `index` will be `1 + 2*t`.
- `results` will be a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration.

Thus, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`path` is the last `path` value processed, `n` is the last `n` value processed, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is a list of results from `func_1(path)` for each iteration.**
