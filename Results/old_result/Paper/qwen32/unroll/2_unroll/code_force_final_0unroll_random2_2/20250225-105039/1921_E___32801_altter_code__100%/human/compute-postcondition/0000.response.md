The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to the variable `r`. The initial state mentions several variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`), but none of these are affected by the code snippet. The variable `r` is introduced and assigned a value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w; it is guaranteed that x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b; the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `r` is a list of integers read from input.**
