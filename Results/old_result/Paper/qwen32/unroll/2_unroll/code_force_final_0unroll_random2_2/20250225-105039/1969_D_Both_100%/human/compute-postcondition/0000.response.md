To determine the output state, we need to understand the implications of the line `test_cases = func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it returns some value which is then assigned to `test_cases`. The other variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given that the function `func_1()` could return any value, we'll denote that return value simply as `func_1_return_value` for the sake of this explanation.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of items, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `prices` is a list of n integers representing the prices for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of n integers representing the negative prices for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of n integers representing the bonuses for Bob, `max_profit` is initialized to 0, `current_profit` is initialized to 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and `combined` is sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` is `func_1_return_value`.**
