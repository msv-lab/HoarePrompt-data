Output State: **For each test case, the output is the final value of `ans` after the loop has computed the sum of `n` and the integer divisions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and each test case's `n` and `m` are processed independently to produce a separate output value.**
