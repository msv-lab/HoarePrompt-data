The given code snippet contains a `print('draw')` statement. The precondition provides information about several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables described in the precondition.

Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:

- The `print('draw')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'draw'`.
- The variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `b` are mentioned in the precondition but are not used in the `print` statement.
- Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output is simply the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
