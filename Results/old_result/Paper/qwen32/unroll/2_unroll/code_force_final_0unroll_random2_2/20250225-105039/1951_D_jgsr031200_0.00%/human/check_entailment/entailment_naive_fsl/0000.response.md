Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code and identify issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if it's possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins.
   - The initial check `if n == k` is correct: if Alice has the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants, she can buy one jewel for 1 coin.
   - The check `if n < k` is also correct: if Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants, she cannot buy all the jewels.
   - However, the logic after these checks is incorrect.

2. **Costs Calculation**:
   - The costs list is initialized with `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which is not a valid strategy for setting up stalls.
   - The loop iterates over the costs list, but the logic inside the loop doesn't correctly determine the number of stalls or their prices.
   - The logic for calculating the number of stalls and their prices is flawed, and it doesn't ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" and the number of stalls and their prices only if the sum of the calculated number of jewels (`h`) is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - However, the program does not ensure that the number of stalls is at most 60, and it does not correctly calculate the prices of the stalls.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 1000000000000000000` (10^18) and `k = 1000000000000000000` (10^18). The program should print "YES", "1", "1" because Alice can buy one jewel for 1 coin.
   - Consider the test case `n = 1000000000000000000` (10^18) and `k = 1`. The program should print "YES", "60", "1 1 1 ... 1" (60 ones) because Alice can buy one jewel from each of the 60 stalls for 1 coin each.
   - The program does not handle these cases correctly.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work as expected:

**Input**:
```
2
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
1000000000000000000 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
YES
1
1
YES
60
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

**Actual Output**:
```
YES
1
1
NO
```

The program incorrectly prints "NO" for the second test case, which should be "YES" with 60 stalls each priced at 1 coin.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
