To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the code does for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, the code reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Special Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, it directly prints `k` and moves to the next test case.
3. **General Case Handling**: For `n > 1`:
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` (which is not used further in the code).
   - It calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than `k` and stores it in `temp`.
   - It constructs a list `ans` starting with `(1 << i) - 1` (which is `2^i - 1` where `i` is the highest power such that `2^i < k`).
   - It then appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans`.
   - It fills the rest of the list `ans` with zeros until its length is `n`.
   - Finally, it prints the list `ans`.

The code processes each test case independently, so the output state after all iterations will depend on the specific values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Since the state of variables not directly involved in the loop (like `t`) remains unchanged, and the results of each test case are printed immediately, the output state can be described as a series of printed results corresponding to each test case.

Output State: **A series of printed results for each test case, where each result is a list of integers of length `n` constructed as described above.**
