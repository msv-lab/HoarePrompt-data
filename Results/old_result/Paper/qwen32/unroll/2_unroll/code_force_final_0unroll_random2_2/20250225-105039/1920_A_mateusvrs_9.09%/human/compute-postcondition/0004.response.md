Given the initial state, we know that after processing all `t` test cases, the list `r` will contain the results for each test case. The `print` statement is designed to print each element of the list `r` on a new line.

Here is the breakdown of the print statement:
- `*r` unpacks the list `r` so that each element of the list is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
- `sep='\n'` specifies that the separator between the elements should be a newline character, meaning each element of `r` will be printed on a new line.

Since the exact contents of the list `r` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical or string values that will be printed. However, we know that each element of `r` will be printed on a new line.

Therefore, the output will be a series of results, one per line, corresponding to the results of each test case.

Output: **Each element of the list `r` printed on a new line (where `r` contains the results for each test case)**
