You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting solely of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: t lines, each containing either 'A' or 'B', based on the counts of 'A' and 'B' in each of the t test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where the number of 'A's and 'B's is equal in the string. According to the problem statement, the program should output the character that appears most frequently. If both characters appear with the same frequency, it does not specify which one to output, but the given program will always output 'B' in such cases, which may not be the correct behavior according to the problem's implied expectations.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
1
ABABB
```
Here, 'A' and 'B' both appear 3 times. The program will output 'B', but since the problem does not specify a preference when frequencies are equal, this could be considered incorrect if the expected output is 'A' in this case.

To fix this, the program should handle the tie case according to the problem's requirements or specifications. If the problem does not specify a preference, the program could be considered correct as long as it consistently handles ties in a defined manner (e.g., always choosing 'A' or always choosing 'B').

However, based on the provided code and the lack of explicit tie-breaking rules in the problem description, the safest assumption is that the code is incorrect because it does not handle the tie case as expected by the problem statement's implied requirements.
