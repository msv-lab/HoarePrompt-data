To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the game rules and the given solution.

### Game Analysis:

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap their wallets or keep their current wallets and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Initial State:** The game starts with Alice having `a` coins and Bob having `b` coins.
2. **Turns:** Alice moves first, and then they alternate turns.
3. **Moves:**
   - Swap wallets or keep the current wallet.
   - Remove one coin from the current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition:** The player who cannot make a move loses.

#### Strategy:

- If the difference `abs(a - b)` between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob wins.
- If the difference `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation of the Program:

The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then checks the parity of the absolute difference `abs(a - b)` and prints "Bob" if the difference is even and "Alice" if the difference is odd.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case: a=1, b=1**
   - `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even) -> Bob wins.
2. **Test Case: a=1, b=4**
   - `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd) -> Alice wins.
3. **Test Case: a=5, b=3**
   - `abs(5 - 3) = 2` (even) -> Bob wins.
4. **Test Case: a=4, b=5**
   - `abs(4 - 5) = 1` (odd) -> Alice wins.
5. **Test Case: a=11, b=9**
   - `abs(11 - 9) = 2` (even) -> Bob wins.
6. **Test Case: a=83, b=91**
   - `abs(83 - 91) = 8` (even) -> Bob wins.
7. **Test Case: a=1032, b=9307**
   - `abs(1032 - 9307) = 8275` (odd) -> Alice wins.
8. **Test Case: a=839204, b=7281**
   - `abs(839204 - 7281) = 831923` (odd) -> Alice wins.
9. **Test Case: a=1000000000, b=1000000000**
   - `abs(1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0` (even) -> Bob wins.
10. **Test Case: a=53110, b=2024**
    - `abs(53110 - 2024) = 51086` (even) -> Bob wins.

The program correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy.

Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The logic aligns with the optimal play strategy derived from the game rules.

Correctness: **True**
