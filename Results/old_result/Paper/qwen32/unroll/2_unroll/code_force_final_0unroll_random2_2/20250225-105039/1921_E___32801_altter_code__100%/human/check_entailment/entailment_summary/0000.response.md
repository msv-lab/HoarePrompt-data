Reasoning:
The given program `func_1` attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and the dimensions of the board. However, there are several issues and oversights in the logic of the program that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Move Handling**: The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players. The logic for moving the chips and checking if a player can win is flawed. For example, the program does not account for the fact that both players can move diagonally and vertically, and it incorrectly calculates the number of moves required for each player to reach the other's position.

2. **Incorrect Win Conditions**: The win conditions are not correctly implemented. The program only checks if the y-coordinates are equal after a single move and does not correctly simulate the game until a win or a draw is determined.

3. **Incorrect Draw Conditions**: The program incorrectly determines draw conditions. For example, it checks if `x2 <= x1` after the first move, which is not the correct condition for a draw. A draw should be determined when neither player can make a move or when they cannot win.

4. **Inconsistent Case Handling**: The program outputs 'bob' in lowercase, which is inconsistent with the problem statement that allows any case for the output.

5. **Incorrect Movement Logic**: The logic for moving the chips and checking the positions is overly complex and does not correctly simulate the game's rules.

6. **Lack of Loop for Game Simulation**: The program does not simulate the game in a loop until a win or a draw is determined. It only makes a single move and checks the conditions, which is insufficient for determining the correct outcome.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **False**
