You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives. This is followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        
        ans = 0
        
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state consists of the printed answers for each test case, which are the sums of the excess counts of each integer in their respective test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the list at most 2 times. The function returns the results for each test case, which are not specified in detail here, but are implied to be based on the given card values and their occurrences.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
