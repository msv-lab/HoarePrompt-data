The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not utilized in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value to be printed is not influenced by the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the constraints and relationships between `t`, `n`, and `k`.
2. The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(2)`.
3. The value `2` is explicitly given in the print statement and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Thus, the output of the code snippet is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
