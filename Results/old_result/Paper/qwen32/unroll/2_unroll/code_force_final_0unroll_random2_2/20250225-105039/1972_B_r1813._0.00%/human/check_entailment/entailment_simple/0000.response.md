### Reasoning:
The program's logic hinges on the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`). The core idea is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because:

1. **Odd Number of 'U's:**
   - Each move reduces the number of 'U's by 1 and possibly flips some coins.
   - If the number of 'U's is initially odd, Alice's first move will make it even, Bob's move will make it odd again, and so on.
   - Eventually, the number of 'U's will reach 1, and Alice will make the final move, winning the game.

2. **Even Number of 'U's:**
   - Starting with an even number of 'U's, Alice's first move will make it odd.
   - Bob can then always make it even again, and so on.
   - The game will end with Bob making the last move, leaving Alice with no 'U's to choose from, making Bob the winner.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U's in the string `s` for each test case and appending 'YES' to the results list if the count is odd, and 'NO' if the count is even. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
