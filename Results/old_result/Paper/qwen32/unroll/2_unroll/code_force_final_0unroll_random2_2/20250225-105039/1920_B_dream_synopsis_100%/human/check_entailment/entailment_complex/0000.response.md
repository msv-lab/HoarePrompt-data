### Reasoning:

The program provided aims to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Sorting and Reversing the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order and then reversed to get the largest elements at the beginning. This helps in easily determining which elements Alice should remove and which ones Bob should negate.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum `sum1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the array.

3. **Iterating Over Possible Moves by Alice:**
   - The program iterates over possible numbers of elements Alice can remove (`i` from 0 to `k`).
   - For each `i`, it calculates the sum of the array after Alice has removed `i` elements and Bob has negated up to `x` elements.

4. **Calculating the Sum After Operations:**
   - If `i == 0`, it calculates the sum assuming Bob negates the `x` largest elements.
   - If `i > 0` and `i + x - 1 < n`, it adjusts the sum by adding back the element Alice removed (`a[i-1]`) and subtracting twice the element Bob would negate (`2 * a[i + x - 1]`).
   - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, it only adds back the element Alice removed (`a[i-1]`), as Bob can't negate more elements than are available.

5. **Tracking Maximum Sum:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum sum obtained for each possible number of elements Alice can remove.

6. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the maximum sum after both players have made their optimal moves.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum after both players have made their optimal moves. It considers all possible scenarios of elements Alice can remove and elements Bob can negate, ensuring the result is the best possible outcome given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the provided logic and the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
