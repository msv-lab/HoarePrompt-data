To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the provided loop processes each test case.

### Explanation of the Loop:
1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, the loop reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `l`.
2. **Sorting**: The list `l` of ticket prices is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Initialization**: Three variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to `0`. These represent the total tickets sold so far (`t`), the number of tickets to sell in the current iteration (`s`), and the total cost (`c`), respectively.
4. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each day's ticket price in the sorted list `l`.
   - **Determine Tickets to Sell (`s`)**: For each day, `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets that can be sold in one day) and `k` (remaining tickets to sell).
   - **Update Total Cost (`c`)**: The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of selling `s` tickets at the current day's price `l[i]` plus the total tickets sold so far `t`.
   - **Update Total Tickets Sold (`t`)**: The total tickets sold `t` is incremented by `s`.
   - **Update Remaining Tickets (`k`)**: The remaining tickets `k` is decremented by `s`.
5. **Output**: After processing all days for a test case, the total cost `c` is printed.

### Output State:
After all the test cases have been processed, the output state will be a series of integers, each representing the total cost `c` for the corresponding test case. The state of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, `s`, and `c` will be specific to each test case and will not persist across different test cases.

### Format of the Output State:
The output state will be a series of integers, one per line, each corresponding to the total cost `c` for each test case.

### Example:
If the input consists of two test cases:
- Test Case 1: `n=3`, `m=2`, `k=4`, `l=[5, 3, 8]`
- Test Case 2: `n=2`, `m=3`, `k=5`, `l=[10, 20]`

The output state would be:
- For Test Case 1: The total cost `c` is calculated and printed.
- For Test Case 2: The total cost `c` is calculated and printed.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **the series of total costs `c` for each test case, one per line.**

Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, the output state is described in terms of the process rather than specific values. Each line in the output corresponds to the total cost for one test case.

Output State: **the series of total costs `c` for each test case, one per line.**
