For each test case, the function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then constructs two lists, `ans1` and `ans2`, each containing `2 * k` integers, ensuring that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice across both lists. The function outputs these two lists.
