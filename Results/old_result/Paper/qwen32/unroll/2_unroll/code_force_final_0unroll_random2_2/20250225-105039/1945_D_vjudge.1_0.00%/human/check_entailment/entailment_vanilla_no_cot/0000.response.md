Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for calculating the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend is flawed. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Reversing of Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed, which does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem describes the queue from the front to the back, and reversing these lists would mean Kirill is trying to move from the back to the front, which doesn't match the problem's intent.

2. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect. The program tries to find the minimum cost by iterating through the reversed lists, but it doesn't correctly handle the conditions for swapping and the cumulative cost of bribing people.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `m = n` or when all `a_i` and `b_i` values are very large.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed. A common method is to use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the smallest possible bribes Kirill can make to move up the queue. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Priority queue to keep track of the smallest bribes
        pq = []
        heapq.heapify(pq)
        cost = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i >= n - m + 1:
                cost += heapq.heappop(pq)
            heapq.heappush(pq, a[i] + b[i] * (n - i - 1))
        
        print(cost)

solve()
```

This corrected program uses a priority queue to efficiently keep track of the minimum bribes needed to move Kirill to the desired position in the queue.
