Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly determines whether the shape drawn on the grid is a square or a triangle based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n`.
   - It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to `0` and an empty string `''` respectively. These are intended to store the result ("TRIANGLE" or "SQUARE").

2. **Processing Each Row:**
   - For each row `s` in the grid:
     - It checks the count of '1's in the row.
     - If the count of '1's is exactly 1, it sets `a` to "TRIANGLE".
     - If the count of '1's is greater than 1, it sets `b` to "SQUARE".

3. **Determining the Shape:**
   - After processing all rows, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `0` (which means it was set to "TRIANGLE").
   - If `a` is not `0`, it prints "TRIANGLE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "SQUARE" (which is stored in `b`).

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Triangle Detection:**
  - The program sets `a` to "TRIANGLE" if any row has exactly one '1'. This is incorrect because a triangle, as per the problem description, has a specific pattern of '1's that increases by 2 for each subsequent row and is centered.
  - A single '1' in a row does not necessarily mean the shape is a triangle.

- **Incorrect Square Detection:**
  - The program sets `b` to "SQUARE" if any row has more than one '1'. This is also incorrect because a square has rows with the same number of '1's, and the '1's are aligned in a specific manner.
  - The program does not check if the '1's are aligned correctly to form a square.

- **Logic Flaw:**
  - The program does not implement any logic to check the alignment and pattern of '1's for either a triangle or a square.
  - It only checks the count of '1's in each row, which is insufficient to determine the shape accurately.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine the shape of the figure drawn on the grid. Therefore, the Correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
