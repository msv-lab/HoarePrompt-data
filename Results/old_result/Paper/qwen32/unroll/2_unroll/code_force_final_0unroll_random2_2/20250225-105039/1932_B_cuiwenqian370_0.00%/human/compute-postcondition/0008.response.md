Given the loop and the initial state, the loop iterates over each `result` in the `results` list and prints it. After the loop finishes, the values of `path`, `n`, and `index` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop. The `results` list is also not altered, as the loop only reads from it.

Output State: **`path` is the last `path` value processed, `n` is the last `n` value processed, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is a list of results from `func_1(path)` for each iteration.**
