You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the product of two numbers, `x` and `y`, by swapping corresponding digits between them. The operations can be performed any number of times, and the digits in `x` and `y` are between 1 and 9.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two numbers `x` and `y`. It then attempts to maximize the product by swapping digits under certain conditions.

### Detailed Steps of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two numbers `x` and `y` as strings and converts them into lists of characters (digits).

2. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program initializes a flag `f` to 0.
   - It iterates through the digits of `x` and `y` simultaneously.
   - If `f` is 0 (which means no swap has occurred yet):
     - If the `i-th` digit of `x` is less than the `i-th` digit of `y`, it swaps these digits and sets `f` to 1.
     - If the `i-th` digit of `x` is greater than the `i-th` digit of `y`, it sets `f` to 1 (no swap).
   - If `f` is 1 (which means a swap has already occurred):
     - If the `i-th` digit of `x` is greater than the `i-th` digit of `y`, it swaps these digits.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the modified `x` and `y` after all possible swaps.

### Issues with the Program:
- The program only performs one swap if the first digit of `x` is less than the first digit of `y` and does not consider further swaps that could potentially maximize the product.
- The flag `f` is set to 1 after the first swap or comparison, which means subsequent digits are not considered for swapping unless the first digit of `x` was already greater than the first digit of `y`.
- This logic does not guarantee that the product of `x` and `y` is maximized. The optimal strategy involves comparing and potentially swapping all corresponding digits to maximize the product, not just the first pair.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
