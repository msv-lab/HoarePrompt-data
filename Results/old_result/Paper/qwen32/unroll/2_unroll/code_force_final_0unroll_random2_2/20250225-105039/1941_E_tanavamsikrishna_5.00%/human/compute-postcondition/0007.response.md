To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, we need to understand the context and how `total_costs` is populated.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` are variables that remain unchanged.
- `costs` is a list that remains unchanged.
- `total_costs` is a list that will contain the sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.

### Calculation of `total_costs`:
The `total_costs` list is populated by summing up `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list. For example, if `costs = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]` and `k = 3`, then `total_costs` would be `[c1 + c2 + c3, c2 + c3 + c4, c3 + c4 + c5]`.

### Determining the Output:
The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum from the `total_costs` list.

### Explanation:
Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given information.

The `total_costs` list contains the sums of all possible `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list. The `min(total_costs)` function finds the smallest sum among these values.

### Final Output:
Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list)**
