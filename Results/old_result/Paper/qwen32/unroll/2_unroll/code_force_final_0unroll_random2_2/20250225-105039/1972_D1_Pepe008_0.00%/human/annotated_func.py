#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.

    #State: The output state consists of `T` printed integers, each representing the result of the calculation `suma - 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints a specific integer value for each test case based on the formula derived from the input values `a` and `b`.
