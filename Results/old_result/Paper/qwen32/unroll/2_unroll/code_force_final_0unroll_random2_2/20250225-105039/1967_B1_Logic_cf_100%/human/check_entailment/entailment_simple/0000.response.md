Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided program calculates the number of valid pairs as follows:
- For each test case, it initializes `ans` to `n` (which accounts for the pairs \((a, 1)\) since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1\)).
- Then, for each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

However, the logic of adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each \(b\) does not correctly account for the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check whether the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true. The provided program does not do this but instead uses a formula that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

Let's consider the first example:
- For \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), the only pair is \((1, 1)\), and the program correctly outputs 1.
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). The program incorrectly outputs 3, but this is coincidental and does not mean the program is correct for other inputs.

Given the complexity of the problem and the need to check each pair, the provided solution's logic is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
