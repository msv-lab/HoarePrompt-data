You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting solely of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: t lines, each containing either 'A' or 'B', based on the counts of 'A' and 'B' in each of the t test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then iterates `t` times, where each iteration corresponds to a new test case.
3. For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.
4. Two counters `l` and `h` are initialized to 0. These counters are used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively in the string.
5. The program iterates over each character in the string `a`. If the character is 'A', it increments `l` by 1. Otherwise, it increments `h` by 1.
6. After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares the values of `l` and `h`.
7. If `l` (the count of 'A') is greater than `h` (the count of 'B'), the program prints 'A'.
8. Otherwise, the program prints 'B'.

There is a subtle issue with the program: It does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. In such a case, the problem description does not specify which letter to output, but the program defaults to outputting 'B'. This is a potential issue if the problem expects a specific behavior in the case of a tie (e.g., always outputting 'A' or always outputting 'B' in a tie). However, based on the examples provided, it seems that the program's behavior is accepted.

Given the examples, the program outputs the correct letter for each test case, and there is no indication that ties should be handled differently. Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and examples.
