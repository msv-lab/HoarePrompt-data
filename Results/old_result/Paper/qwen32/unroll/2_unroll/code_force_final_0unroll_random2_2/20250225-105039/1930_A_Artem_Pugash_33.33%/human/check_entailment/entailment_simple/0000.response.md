### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the final score by optimally pairing the numbers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is a critical step because the strategy to achieve the maximum final score involves pairing the smallest available numbers first. By sorting, we ensure that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list, making it easier to pick them.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program then iteratively picks the first two numbers from the sorted list (which are the smallest in the remaining list), adds the smaller of the two to the score, and removes both numbers from the list. This process is repeated until all numbers are paired and removed.

4. **Output**: After processing all numbers for a test case, the program prints the computed score, which is the maximum possible score for that test case.

5. **Looping Through Test Cases**: The above steps are repeated for each test case.

### Correctness:
The strategy of sorting the list and pairing the smallest numbers is optimal because it ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible value to the score, which maximizes the score given the constraints of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example executions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
