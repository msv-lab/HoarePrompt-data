### Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins each player has and their optimal strategy. The key insight is that the game can be reduced to analyzing the parity (even or odd) of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have.

Here's the strategy breakdown:
- **If the absolute difference (|a - b|) is even**: Bob wins. This is because Alice will always be the one to face an even difference first, and she can always force Bob to face an odd difference, leading to Bob's eventual loss.
- **If the absolute difference (|a - b|) is odd**: Alice wins. Alice can always force Bob to face an even difference, leading to Bob's eventual loss.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` for each test case and printing "Alice" or "Bob" accordingly.
