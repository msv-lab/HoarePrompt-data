Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in a list `a` and `k` is another integer. The list `a` contains `n` integers, each within the range from -10^9 to 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.**
