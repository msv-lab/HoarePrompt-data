Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of coins (1 <= n <= 100), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D". The function returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the `n` and `s` values read in each iteration.**
