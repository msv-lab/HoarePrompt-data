The loop in the given code snippet depends on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, the only variable we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes is the value that `int(input())` will return.

Given that the loop will run `t` times, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns `t`. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that the input will provide the value of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the input will provide the value of `t`**
