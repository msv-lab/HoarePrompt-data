### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum cost of placing supports on a single row of the grid.
- **Logic**:
  - The first `d-1` cells are each incremented by 1.
  - For each subsequent cell, the cost is calculated as the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the depth of the current cell plus 1.
  - The function returns the cost of placing supports in the last cell of the row.
- **Output Hints**: The function correctly modifies the row according to the problem's rules and returns the total cost for that row.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function reads the input, calculates the minimum cost for placing `k` consecutive bridges, and prints the result.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - Reads the grid of depths.
  - For each row, it calculates the cost of placing supports using `func_1`.
  - For each possible starting row (from 1 to `n-k+1`), it sums the costs of placing `k` consecutive bridges.
  - It keeps track of the minimum total cost among all possible placements.
- **Output Hints**: The function correctly calculates and prints the minimum total cost for placing `k` consecutive bridges.

### Verification of the Program:
- The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case independently.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cost of placing supports in a single row according to the problem's rules.
- The function `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum total cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges by considering all possible starting rows and summing the costs.
- The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem description correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
