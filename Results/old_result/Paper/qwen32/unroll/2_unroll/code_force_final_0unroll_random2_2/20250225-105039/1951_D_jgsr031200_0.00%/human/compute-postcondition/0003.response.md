The provided initial state describes the values of `n` and `k` as positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and it specifies that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
