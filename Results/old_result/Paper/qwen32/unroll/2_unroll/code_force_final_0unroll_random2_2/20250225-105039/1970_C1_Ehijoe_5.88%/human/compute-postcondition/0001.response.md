The code snippet provided initializes an empty deque named `tree`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, or the structure of the tree itself, as the tree's edges are not being modified or stored in the deque at this point. The starting node of the stone, represented by the integers `u_1, ..., u_t`, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node of the stone for each round. `tree` is an empty deque.**
