The code snippet provided is just reading an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. No other variables are affected or initialized in this snippet. The values of `n`, `m`, and the string `a` are not yet read or assigned.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5), where `n` is the number of problems in the bank and `m` is the number of upcoming rounds. This is followed by a string `a` of length `n`, consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
