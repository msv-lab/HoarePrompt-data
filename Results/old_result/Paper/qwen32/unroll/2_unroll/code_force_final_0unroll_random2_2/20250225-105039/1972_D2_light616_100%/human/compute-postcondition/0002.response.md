The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt` have specific values and constraints, but since `n` and `m` are reassigned, their values will be updated based on the input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0.**

This means that `n` and `m` now hold the values provided by the user input, while `x` and `cnt` retain their initial values of 1 and 0, respectively.
