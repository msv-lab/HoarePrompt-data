Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. The integer `a` denotes the type of constraint (1 for k >= x, 2 for k <= x, 3 for k != x). The function returns the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case.**
