### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by dividing the array `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`. It then tries to construct two arrays `ans1` and `ans2` each of length `2k` such that their bitwise XORs are equal. However, the logic used to construct these arrays is flawed, and it does not guarantee that the bitwise XORs of `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal for all test cases.

Here's a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Initialization and Selection of Elements:**
   - The code first separates the array `a` into `b` (first `n` elements) and `c` (last `n` elements).
   - It then sorts both `b` and `c`.
   - It initializes `ans1` and `ans2` as empty lists and sets `k` to `2*k` (which is the total number of elements required in each of the final lists).
   - The code then tries to select elements from `b` and `c` to fill `ans1` and `ans2`.

2. **Selection Logic:**
   - The code checks if the first and last elements of `b` are unique and adds them to a list `l` if they are.
   - It then iterates through `b` and adds pairs of identical elements to `ans1` and single elements to `l`.
   - It repeats a similar process for `c`, adding pairs of identical elements to `ans2`.
   - Finally, it tries to balance `ans1` and `ans2` by adding elements from `l` to both lists until `k` elements are added to each.

3. **Bitwise XOR Consideration:**
   - The code does not explicitly ensure that the bitwise XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` is equal. The selection of elements is based on the presence of duplicate elements and the order of elements, but it does not guarantee that the XORs will be equal.

4. **Example Issues:**
   - Consider the test case `n=6, k=1, a=[6, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 5, 5, 4]`. The expected output could be `6 4` and `1 3` or any other valid pair. However, the code might not produce a valid pair due to the flawed selection logic.

Given the above points, the code does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` will always be equal, which is a critical requirement of the problem.
