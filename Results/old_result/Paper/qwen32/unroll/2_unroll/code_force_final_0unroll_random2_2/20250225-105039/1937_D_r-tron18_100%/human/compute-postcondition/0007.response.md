To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **s1**: A string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
2. **n**: A non-negative integer equal to the length of `s1`.
3. **pre**: A list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
4. **totalOne**: Initialized to 0.
5. **preOne**: An empty list.
6. **suffZero**: A list containing cumulative sums of indices of '0' characters (Note: This seems incorrect as `suffZero` should be related to '<' characters, not '0').
7. **ans**: A list of `n` values calculated based on certain conditions.

### Key Points to Understand:
- **pre**: This list contains the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`. For example, if `s1` is `"<><>"`, `pre` would be `[2, 4]`.
- **suffZero**: This list should ideally contain cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters, not '0'. However, based on the context, it seems to be related to '<' characters.
- **ans**: This list is calculated based on some conditions, but the exact conditions are not specified in the problem statement. 

### Calculation of `ans`:
Since the exact conditions for calculating `ans` are not provided, let's assume that `ans` is calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters. A common approach in such problems is to calculate the number of '>' characters before each position and the number of '<' characters after each position.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s1` is `"<><>"`:
- `n = 4`
- `pre = [2, 4]` (1-based indices of '>')
- `totalOne = 0` (initially)
- `preOne` will be populated based on the number of '>' characters before each position.
- `suffZero` will be populated based on the number of '<' characters after each position.
- `ans` will be calculated based on these values.

Since the exact conditions are not provided, let's assume a simple calculation:
- `ans[i]` could be the number of '>' characters before position `i` minus the number of '<' characters after position `i`.

### Example Output:
For `s1 = "<><>"`:
- `ans` could be calculated as `[0, 0, 1, 1]` (assuming the above simple calculation).

### General Output:
Since the exact conditions are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the calculation logic.

### Final Output:
Given the above assumptions and the lack of exact conditions, the output will be based on the calculated values of `ans`. Since the exact values are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the logic used to calculate `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a list of n values calculated based on the conditions related to the positions of '<' and '>' characters in s1)**
