To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables are affected. The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads new values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`, and then calls `func_1` with these values. The result of `func_1` is printed in each iteration. However, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are reinitialized in each iteration, so they do not retain their values from one iteration to the next.

Since the loop reinitializes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` in each iteration, after the loop finishes, these variables will hold the values from the last iteration. However, since the loop does not modify any global variables or external state outside of its body, the initial state of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` provided before the loop starts will not be affected by the loop itself, except for the last iteration.

The output state will only reflect the final values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` from the last iteration of the loop, along with the fact that the loop has executed `t` times and the results of `func_1` have been printed.

Given that the problem does not specify the behavior of `func_1` or the exact input values for each iteration, we can only describe the output state in terms of the last iteration's input values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `t` will be 0 (since the loop will have finished executing). The results of `func_1` for each iteration will have been printed, but these results are not stored in any variable in the provided code snippet.**
