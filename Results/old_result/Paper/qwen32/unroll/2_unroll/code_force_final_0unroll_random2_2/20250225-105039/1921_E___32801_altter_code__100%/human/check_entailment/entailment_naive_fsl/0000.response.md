Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The code attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and the rules of movement. However, the logic seems flawed in handling certain scenarios, particularly when the number of moves required for Alice to reach Bob's position is even or odd.

Here is a specific test case that the current implementation fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 5 1 1 4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- Alice starts at (1, 1).
- Bob starts at (4, 4).
- Alice can move diagonally down-right to (2, 2), then to (3, 3), and finally to (4, 4) in 3 moves.
- Bob can move diagonally up-left to (3, 3), then to (2, 2), and finally to (1, 1) in 3 moves.
- Since both can reach the other's position in an odd number of moves, it seems like Alice should win, but the game ends in a draw because neither can force a win on the other.

However, the code incorrectly prints "Bob" for this case, indicating a flaw in the logic.

**Another Test Case:**
```
1
5 5 1 4 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- Alice starts at (1, 4).
- Bob starts at (4, 1).
- Alice can move diagonally down-left to (2, 3), then to (3, 2), and finally to (4, 1) in 3 moves.
- Bob can move diagonally up-right to (3, 2), then to (2, 3), and finally to (1, 4) in 3 moves.
- Again, the game ends in a draw because neither can force a win on the other.

The code incorrectly prints "Alice" for this case, further confirming the flaw in the logic.

Given these test cases, the code does not correctly determine the outcome for all possible scenarios, hence the correctness is **False**.
