You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons or up to 3 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`a`) and 2x2 icons (`b`). It then calculates the minimum number of screens needed as follows:

1. **Handling 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`t`).
   - If `b` is even, it divides `b` by 2 (since each screen can hold 2 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is odd, it divides `b` by 2 and rounds up (since one more screen is needed for the remaining icon).

2. **Handling 1x1 Icons:**
   - It calculates the remaining capacity on the screens used for 2x2 icons (`t1`).
   - If the remaining capacity is greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons, no additional screens are needed.
   - If the remaining capacity is not enough, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. Dividing by 2 and rounding up is correct, but the calculation of remaining capacity (`t1`) is flawed.
- The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` does not correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. It assumes each screen used for 2x2 icons is completely filled, which is not always true.
- The logic for placing 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons is also flawed because it does not correctly consider the partial occupancy of screens used for 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the program, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed in all cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately compute the minimum number of screens required based on the given constraints. A correct implementation would need to carefully account for the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons and ensure that screens are utilized optimally.
