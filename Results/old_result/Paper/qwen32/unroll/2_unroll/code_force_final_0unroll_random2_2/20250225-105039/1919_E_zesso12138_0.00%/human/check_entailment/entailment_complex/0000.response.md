### Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of possible initial arrays `a` that could result in a given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The solution utilizes dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to achieve the given prefix sums.

#### Analysis of `func_1(n, p)`:
- The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[offset]` which is set to 1. Here, `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices.
- It iterates through each element of the prefix sum array `p` and updates the `dp` array to reflect the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
- The update rule involves adding the number of ways to reach the current prefix sum to the number of ways to reach the prefix sums that can be obtained by adding or subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum.
- Finally, the function returns the value in `dp` corresponding to the final prefix sum in `p` adjusted by the `offset`.

#### Analysis of `func_2()`:
- This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute the number of possible initial arrays `a`.
- It collects the results for each test case and prints them.

#### Correctness of the Approach:
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` correctly models the problem of counting the number of ways to achieve the given prefix sums through a sequence of 1s and -1s.
- The use of `offset` allows the dynamic programming array to handle negative indices, which is crucial for the problem.
- The solution efficiently computes the result modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It reads the input, processes each test case using dynamic programming, and outputs the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
