To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that the conditions in the loop head are satisfied. The loop head is:

```python
while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
```

Let's break down the conditions:

1. `left <= right`: This condition is already satisfied because `left` is 0 and `right` is 1.
2. `right < len(s)`: This condition requires that `right` is less than the length of the list `s`. Since `right` is 1, `s` must have at least 2 elements.
3. `left < len(s)`: This condition requires that `left` is less than the length of the list `s`. Since `left` is 0, `s` must have at least 1 element.

Given that `s` is a list that contains all the binary strings from `sChar` in the same order, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of `s`. Specifically, `s` must have at least 2 elements to ensure that both `right < len(s)` and `left < len(s)` are satisfied.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`s` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sChar` remains unchanged, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
