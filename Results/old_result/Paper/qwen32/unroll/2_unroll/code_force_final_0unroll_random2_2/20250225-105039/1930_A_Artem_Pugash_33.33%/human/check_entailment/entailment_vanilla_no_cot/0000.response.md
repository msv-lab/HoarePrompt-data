Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers together. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we pair the numbers, the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimums.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program iteratively pops the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest due to the sorting step), calculates their minimum, and adds this minimum to the score. This process is repeated `n` times, which is the correct number of moves.

4. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the accumulated score.

This approach is optimal because sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are always paired together, thereby maximizing the score as required by the problem statement.
