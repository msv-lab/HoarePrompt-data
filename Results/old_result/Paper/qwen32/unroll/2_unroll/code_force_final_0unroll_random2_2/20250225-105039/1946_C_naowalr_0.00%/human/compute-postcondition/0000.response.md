The code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5; `t` is an integer read from the standard input.**
