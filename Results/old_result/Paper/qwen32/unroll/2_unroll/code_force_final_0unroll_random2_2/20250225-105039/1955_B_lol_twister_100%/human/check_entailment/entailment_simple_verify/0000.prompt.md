You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for constructing a progressive square based on the given rules. Specifically, the program assumes that the smallest element in the list is `a_{1,1}`, which is not necessarily true. The value of `a_{1,1}` should be derived from the given values of `c` and `d` and the provided list of integers.

The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the smallest element in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}`. This assumption can lead to incorrect results because `a_{1,1}` could be any value that, when used to construct the progressive square with the given `c` and `d`, results in the same set of elements as the provided list `l`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the value of `a_{1,1}` such that the constructed progressive square matches the provided list `l`. The current implementation does not account for this and can therefore produce incorrect results.

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 3
4 7 10 5 8 11 6 9 12
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the program incorrectly determines that the elements do not match because it assumes `a_{1,1}` is 4, which is not the correct value. The correct value for `a_{1,1}` in this case would be 1, leading to the correct progressive square.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
