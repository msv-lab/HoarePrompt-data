The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even. It constructs a permutation list of length `n` by filling it with values in a specific pattern: starting from each `i`-th position, it fills every `k`-th position thereafter with consecutive integers. Finally, it prints the permutation list as a space-separated string.
