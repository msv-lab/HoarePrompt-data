You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements:

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Anna's Move**: Anna reverses the digits of an element in the list.
2. **Sasha's Move**: Sasha concatenates two different elements in the list and inserts the result back into the list, removing the two original elements.
3. **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number is not less than \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`**:
   - It calculates the total number of digits in all numbers in the list.
   - It calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and sorts them in descending order.
   - It subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the total digits for every second element in the sorted list.
   - It returns 'Sasha' if the remaining total digits are greater than or equal to \(m + 1\); otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.

2. **Function `zerocnts(num)`**:
   - It counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.

### Issues:
- The code does not simulate the actual game moves.
- It does not consider the optimal strategies for both players.
- The code focuses on the number of digits and trailing zeros, which are not sufficient to determine the final concatenated number.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:

```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```

- **Anna's Turn**: Anna can reverse any number. Let's say she reverses 56 to 65.
- **Sasha's Turn**: Sasha can concatenate 9 and 1 to form 91 or 19. Let's say he forms 91.
- **Anna's Turn**: Anna can reverse 65 to 56.
- **Sasha's Turn**: Sasha concatenates 56 and 91 to form 5691.

The final number is 5691, which is greater than \(10^5\). Therefore, Sasha should win.

However, the code would likely not handle this correctly because it does not simulate the game moves and does not consider the optimal strategies for both players.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement and does not consider the optimal strategies for both players. Therefore, it is incorrect.
