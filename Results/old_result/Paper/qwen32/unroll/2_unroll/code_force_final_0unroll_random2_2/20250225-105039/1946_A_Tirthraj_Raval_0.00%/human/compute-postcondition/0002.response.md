The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given that `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The values of `n` and `a` are not directly relevant to the execution of the for loop itself, but they are mentioned as context for what might happen within the loop body.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized or adjusted before the loop starts since it is assigned a value in each iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` must be at least 1**
