The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `w`. The initial state describes `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, but none of these are affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, `w` will hold the value of the input integer, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is an input integer.**
