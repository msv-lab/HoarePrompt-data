You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. There are three types of constraints:
1. `k` must be greater than or equal to some integer `x` (type 1).
2. `k` must be less than or equal to some integer `x` (type 2).
3. `k` must not be equal to some integer `x` (type 3).

The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases and output the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then reads `n` constraints and processes them accordingly.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - `cx` is a set used to store all the values for type 3 constraints (values `k` must not be equal to).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`), representing the maximum possible value for type 2 constraints.
   - `bx` is initialized to a small value (`-1`), representing the minimum possible value for type 1 constraints.
   - For each constraint:
     - If it's a type 1 constraint (`a == 1`), `bx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If it's a type 2 constraint (`a == 2`), `ax` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If it's a type 3 constraint (`a == 3`), `x` is added to the set `cx`.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` (the minimum value `k` must be greater than or equal to) is greater than or equal to `ax` (the maximum value `k` must be less than or equal to). If so, it means there are no valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, and the result for this test case is `0`.
   - If `bx < ax`, the program calculates the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of integers in this range that are in the set `cx` (values `k` must not be equal to). This is done by iterating over the set `cx` and counting how many of its elements are in the range `[bx, ax]`. The final result for this test case is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are in the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program stores the result for each test case in a list `r` and prints all results at the end.

### Correctness

The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It handles all types of constraints and ensures that the constraints are finite and consistent (as guaranteed by the problem statement).

However, there is a mistake in the condition `if bx >= ax:`. The correct condition should be `if bx > ax:` because `bx` and `ax` represent the inclusive bounds of the valid range for `k`. If `bx > ax`, then there are no valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

### Corrected Condition

The condition should be:
```python
if bx > ax:
    r.append(0)
```

### Conclusion

The program is almost correct but has a small mistake in the condition. The corrected condition should be `if bx > ax:`. Given the original condition `if bx >= ax:`, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
