    #State: For each test case, the length of the modified list `s` followed by the elements of the modified list `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `x`. For each test case, it transforms the binary representation of `x` according to specific rules and outputs the length of the resulting list and the list itself.
