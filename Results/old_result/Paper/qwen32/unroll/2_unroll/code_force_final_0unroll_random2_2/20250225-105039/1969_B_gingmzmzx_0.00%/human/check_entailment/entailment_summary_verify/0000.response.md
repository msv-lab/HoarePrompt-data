### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)
```

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case. For each string, it calculates a value based on the positions of '0's and '1's and prints this value. The printed value for each test case represents the number of valid pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the substring s[i:j+1] contains at least one '0' and one '1'.

#### Analysis:
The program does not seem to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `zeroes` counts the number of zeros in the string.
   - `cnt` is a list that keeps track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - `ans` is the variable that accumulates the total cost.

2. **Loop Through Each Character**:
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - Increment the count of `c` in `cnt`.
     - If `c` is 0 and there have been any 1s encountered (`cnt[1] > 0`), increment the cost by 1. This suggests that each 0 encountered after a 1 contributes to the cost.
     - If `c` is 1, add the number of remaining zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost. This suggests that each 1 encountered contributes the number of remaining zeros to the cost.

#### Evaluation:
The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Here's why:

- The logic in the loop does not properly account for the cost of cyclic shifts. The cost should be related to the length of the substring being shifted, but the provided code does not reflect this.
- The program does not actually perform any cyclic shifts; it only calculates a cost based on some heuristic that does not align with the problem description.

#### Counterexample:
Let's consider the example `101011`:
- The program calculates the cost as `5`, but let's see if this is correct.

To sort `101011` to `000111`:
1. Perform a cyclic shift on `[1, 3]`: `101011 -> 011011` (cost: 3)
2. Perform a cyclic shift on `[2, 4]`: `011011 -> 001111` (cost: 3)

Total cost: `3 + 3 = 6` (not 5).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. It uses a heuristic that does not align with the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

Final: **False**
