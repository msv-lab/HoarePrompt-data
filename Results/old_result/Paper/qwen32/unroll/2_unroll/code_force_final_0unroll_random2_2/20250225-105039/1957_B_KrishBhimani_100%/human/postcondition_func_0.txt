The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs and prints a list of `n` integers. If `n` is 1, the list contains only `k`. Otherwise, it constructs a list starting with the largest power of 2 minus 1 that is less than `k`, followed by the difference between `k` and the sum of the constructed numbers, and fills the rest of the list with zeros.
