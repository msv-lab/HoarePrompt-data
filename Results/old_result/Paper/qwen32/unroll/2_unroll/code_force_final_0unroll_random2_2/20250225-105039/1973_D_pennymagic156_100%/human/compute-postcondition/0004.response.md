To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `n // k + 1`.

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if the range `(1, n // k + 1)` is non-empty. This means that `n // k + 1` must be greater than `1`.

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `n // k + 1 > 1` implies `n // k > 0`, which means `n` must be greater than `0` and `k` must be a positive integer (since `k` is between `1` and `n` inclusive, this is already ensured).
2. `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n // k + 1`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `n` and `k` are such that the range is non-empty. Since `k` is between `1` and `n` inclusive, we only need to ensure `n` is greater than `0`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than `0` and `k` is within the specified range.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `v` is `n` or the value of `i` where `func_2()` returned `n`**
