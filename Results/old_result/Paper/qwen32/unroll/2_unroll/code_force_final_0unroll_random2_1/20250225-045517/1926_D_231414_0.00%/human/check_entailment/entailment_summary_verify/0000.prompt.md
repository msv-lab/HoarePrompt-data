You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        dic = dict()
        ans = n
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if s in dic:
                dic[s] -= 1
                ans -= 1
                if dic[s] == 0:
                    del dic[s]
            elif i in dic:
                dic[i] += 1
            else:
                dic[i] = 1
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. For each integer in the list, it calculates a value based on the XOR operation with a fixed constant (2^31 - 1). It then updates a dictionary to track occurrences of these values and adjusts a counter `ans` to reflect the number of unique values. The function prints the updated counter after processing each integer in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Logic Error in Grouping Numbers**:
   The core idea of the problem is to group numbers such that no two numbers in the same group share any matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit (least significant bits). The current implementation uses a dictionary to count occurrences and seems to try to reduce the number of groups by some logic involving XOR and dictionary manipulations, but it does not correctly ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

2. **Incorrect Use of XOR**:
   The line `s = i ^ check` does not serve the purpose of checking for matching bits. XORing a number with `2**31 - 1` (which is a binary number with 31 ones) flips all the bits of the number. This operation does not help in identifying numbers that can be grouped together based on the problem's criteria.

3. **Incorrect Grouping Logic**:
   The program attempts to reduce the number of groups by decrementing `ans` when a number's complement (flipped bits) is found in the dictionary. This logic is incorrect because it does not ensure that numbers in the same group do not share any matching bits.

4. **Immediate Printing of Answer**:
   The program prints the answer after processing each number in the list, which is incorrect. The final answer for each test case should be printed only after all numbers in that test case have been processed.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   Let's consider the first test case from the problem description:
   ```
   4
   1 4 3 4
   ```
   - Binary representations:
     - 1: `0000000000000000000000000000001`
     - 4: `0000000000000000000000000000100`
     - 3: `0000000000000000000000000000011`
     - 4: `0000000000000000000000000000100`
   - Since all numbers share at least one matching bit, they must be placed in different groups. The correct answer is 4, but the program will not produce this result due to the incorrect logic.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
