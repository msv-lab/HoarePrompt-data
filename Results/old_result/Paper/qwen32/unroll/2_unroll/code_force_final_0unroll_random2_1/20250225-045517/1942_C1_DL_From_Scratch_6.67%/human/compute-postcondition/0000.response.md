Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the integer input, representing the number of test cases. The other variables `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, as well as the list of vertices, remain unchanged in this state.
