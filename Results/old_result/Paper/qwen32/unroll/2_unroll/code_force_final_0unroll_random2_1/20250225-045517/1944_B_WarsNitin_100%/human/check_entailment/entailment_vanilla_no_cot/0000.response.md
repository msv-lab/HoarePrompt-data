Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to split the array `a` into two parts, `b` and `c`, and then select two subsets `l` and `r` of lengths `2k` from `b` and `c` respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Splitting the input array `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`.
2. Sorting both halves.
3. Selecting elements from `b` and `c` to form `ans1` and `ans2` respectively.
4. Ensuring that the XOR of elements in `ans1` equals the XOR of elements in `ans2`.

However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not guarantee that the XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal. Let's go through the program step by step to identify the issues:

- **Sorting and Selection**:
  - The program sorts both halves of the array.
  - It then tries to select elements from `b` and `c` based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not ensure that the XOR of the selected elements will be equal.
  
- **Handling of Duplicates**:
  - The program checks for duplicates and adds pairs of duplicate elements to `ans1` and `ans2`.
  - However, it does not ensure that the XOR of the remaining elements in `l` will balance out to make the XOR of `ans1` equal to the XOR of `ans2`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might have specific patterns that require a different selection strategy to achieve the desired XOR equality.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed logic and the lack of a guaranteed method to ensure that the XOR of `ans1` equals the XOR of `ans2`, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
