Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic within the loop and the calculation of the cost `c` are incorrect. Here are the issues:

1. **Initialization of `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The cost should start at 0, and the correct cost should be accumulated based on the prices and the number of tickets bought.

2. **Logic in the Loop**: The loop iterates over the days, and within the loop, it calculates `s = min(m, k)`, which is correct as it determines the number of tickets that can be bought on that day. However, the subsequent calculations are incorrect. The cost `c` should be updated by adding the total cost of the tickets bought on that day, which is `s * (l[i] + current_increase)`, where `current_increase` is the total increase in price due to previous purchases. The program does not keep track of `current_increase` and incorrectly subtracts `s * s / 2` from `c`.

3. **Output**: The final output should be the total cost of buying `k` tickets, but due to the incorrect logic, the output is not correct.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = 0
        current_increase = 0
        for price in l:
            if k == 0:
                break
            tickets_today = min(m, k)
            c += tickets_today * (price + current_increase)
            k -= tickets_today
            current_increase += tickets_today
        print(c)

func()
```

In this corrected version, `current_increase` keeps track of the price increase due to previous purchases, and the cost `c` is correctly updated by adding the total cost of the tickets bought on each day.

Correctness: **False**
