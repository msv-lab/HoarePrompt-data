The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `index`. This does not affect the list `data` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the `data` list remains unchanged, and `index` is now `0`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a component of the original input string split by whitespace; `index` is 0.**
