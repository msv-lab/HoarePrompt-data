Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing a boolean, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`. The boolean is `True` if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, and `False` otherwise. The substring is the part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. `s2` is the set of characters from `s` that caused the alphabet to reset.**

In simpler terms, the program checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n` times `k`, returns that check as a boolean, then returns the remaining part of `s1` starting from every `k`th index, and finally returns `s2`.
