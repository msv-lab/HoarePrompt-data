#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no input parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits this line into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, and it returns an integer which is obtained from the input.

    #The program returns an integer obtained from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer obtained from the user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and returns a map object that yields integers. This map object is created by applying the `int` function to each element of the input split by whitespace.
def func_3():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a map object that yields integers. These integers are obtained by converting each element of the input string, which is split by whitespace, to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature, hence no precondition can be derived from the given function.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
