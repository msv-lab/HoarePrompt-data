### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. Let's break down the evidence:

#### Problem Description:
The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on the periodicities of the signs. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the second sign must occur after the first, the third after the second, and so on.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:** This function appears to be designed to count the maximum number of '@' characters in a sequence while considering '*' as a reset point. It is unrelated to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.
- **Function `func_2`:** This function reads input and processes each test case using `func_1`, which, as established, is not relevant to the problem. It does not correctly handle the input format or compute the required output.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the behavior of `func_1` and `func_2` in detail, confirming that they are not related to the problem at hand. The annotations show that `func_1` processes a sequence of '@' and '*' characters and calculates a count based on these characters, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation provided in the original assessment reads the input, processes each test case by iterating through the signs and calculating the next occurrence year based on the previous sign's occurrence year, and prints the results. This aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The correct implementation is provided in the original assessment and should be used instead.

### Final:
Final: **False**
