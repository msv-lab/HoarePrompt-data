### Reasoning:

The given problem involves determining the maximum profit Bob can make by selling `n` buns under specific pricing rules. The key is to decide the optimal number `k` of buns to sell at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins, where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determining `k`:**
   - The value of `k` is determined as `min(n, b - a)`. This is because:
     - If `b - a` is less than `n`, then only `b - a` buns can be sold at the modified price because the price of the `b - a + 1`-th bun would drop to 0 or below, which is not feasible.
     - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then all `n` buns can be sold at the modified price.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as:
     - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`: This computes the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1`. The sum of an arithmetic series can be computed using the formula `sum = k * (2b - k + 1) / 2`, which simplifies to `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This computes the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum profit.

The logic correctly handles all edge cases, including when `b <= a` and when `b - a` is less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it accurately computes the maximum profit for each test case based on the given rules.

**Correctness: True**
