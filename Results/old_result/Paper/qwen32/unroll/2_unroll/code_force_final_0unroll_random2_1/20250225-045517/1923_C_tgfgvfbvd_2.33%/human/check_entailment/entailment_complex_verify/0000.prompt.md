You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0, i.e., 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the sum of a specified sub-list is at least twice the length of that sub-list, printing 'YES' if true and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good".
- A subarray is "good" if there exists an array `b` of the same length such that:
  1. The sum of elements in the subarray of `c` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. Each element in the subarray of `c` is not equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
  3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and then for each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray can be split into two parts such that the sum of one part is at least twice the length of the subarray. If this condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Key Points:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array `c`.
   - The prefix sum `p[i]` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `c`.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not check if the subarray can be transformed into an array `b` where each element in `b` is different from `c` and greater than 0.
- The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` does not guarantee that the subarray can be transformed into a valid array `b` according to the problem's constraints.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
- The subarray is `[1, 1, 1]`, and its sum is `3`.
- The length of the subarray is `3`.
- The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` translates to `3 >= 2 * 3`, which is `False`.
- Therefore, the program will output `NO`.

However, let's try to construct a valid array `b`:
- We need `b` such that `b[0] + b[1] + b[2] = 3` and `b[i] > 0` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
- One possible `b` could be `[2, 1, 0]`, but `b[2]` is not greater than 0.
- Another possible `b` could be `[2, 0, 1]`, but `b[1]` is not greater than 0.
- It is impossible to create such an array `b`.

For this input, the correct output should be `NO` because it is impossible to create a valid array `b` that meets all the conditions. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. It only checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, which is not a sufficient condition.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
