The only variables in the loop head are the loop variable `_` and the range `2`. The loop will execute as long as the range is greater than 0. Since the range is a constant `2`, the loop will always execute twice regardless of the values of `n` or `a`.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and there are no variables in the loop head that can be adjusted to affect the execution of the loop, the states of `n` and `a` do not need to be changed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of the grid for a test case, `a` is an empty list**
