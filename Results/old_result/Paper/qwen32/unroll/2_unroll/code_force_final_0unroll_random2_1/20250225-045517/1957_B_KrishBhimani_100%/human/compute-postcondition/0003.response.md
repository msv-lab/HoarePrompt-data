Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. If `n` is 1, it outputs `k`. If `n` is greater than 1, it outputs a list of length `n` starting with the largest power of 2 minus 1 that is less than `k`, followed by the remainder when `k` is subtracted by this power of 2 minus 1, and the rest of the list filled with zeros.**
