Output State: **`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input representing the number of test cases. The initial state conditions for `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**

This means that `T` now holds the integer value that was input, representing the number of test cases. The conditions on `t`, `n`, and `m` from the initial state are still valid.
