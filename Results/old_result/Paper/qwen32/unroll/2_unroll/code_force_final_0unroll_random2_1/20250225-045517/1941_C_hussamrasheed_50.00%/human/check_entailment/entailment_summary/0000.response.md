### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each test case string and then summing these counts to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. However, this approach is flawed.

Here's why the program is incorrect:
1. **Counting Substrings**: The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" directly. This does not account for overlapping substrings or the possibility of removing characters in a way that minimizes deletions. For example, if the string is "mappie", the program would count 1 "map" and 1 "pie", leading to a total of 2 deletions. However, removing just the 'm' and 'p' from "mappie" (resulting in "appie") would make it beautiful with only 2 deletions, but the program does not consider this optimal solution.
   
2. **Overlapping Substrings**: The program does not handle overlapping substrings properly. For example, in the string "mappie", the 'p' in "map" and the 'p' in "pie" are the same character, but the program counts them separately, leading to an incorrect result.

3. **Greedy Deletion**: The program does not employ a greedy or dynamic programming approach to minimize deletions. It simply counts and sums the occurrences of the substrings, which does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It fails to account for overlapping substrings and does not provide an optimal solution for minimizing deletions.
