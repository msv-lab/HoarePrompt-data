Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic implemented in the program does not accurately reflect the cost calculation for achieving the sorted order through cyclic shifts.

The program seems to be attempting to count the number of inversions or transitions from '1' to '0' but does not properly account for the cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. The correct approach would involve more sophisticated logic to determine the optimal sequence of cyclic shifts and their associated costs.
