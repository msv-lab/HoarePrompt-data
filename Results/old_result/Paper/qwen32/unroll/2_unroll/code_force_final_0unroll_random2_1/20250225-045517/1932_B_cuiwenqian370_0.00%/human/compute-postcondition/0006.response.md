To determine the output state after the execution of the loop, we need to understand the sequence of operations within the loop and how they affect the variables.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `path` is a string of space-separated integers.
   - `n` is an integer (initially set but will be reassigned in the loop).
   - `data` is a list of strings, where each string is one of the integers from `path`.
   - `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
   - `index` is initialized to 1.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `n` is reassigned to the integer value of the string at `data[index]`.
     - `index` is incremented by 1.
     - `path` is reassigned to the string at `data[index]`.
     - `index` is incremented by 1.
     - `func_1(path)` is called, and its result is appended to `results`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `t` iterations will have been performed.
   - `n` will hold the last value assigned to it, which is the integer value of the string at `data[index - 2]` in the final iteration.
   - `path` will hold the last value assigned to it, which is the string at `data[index - 1]` in the final iteration.
   - `index` will be `2 * t + 1` because in each iteration, `index` is incremented by 2.
   - `results` will contain the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration.

**Output State:** `path` is the string at `data[2 * t]`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[2 * t - 1]`, `data` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, and `results` contains the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration.

Output State: **path is the string at data[2 * t], n is the integer value of the string at data[2 * t - 1], data remains unchanged, t remains unchanged, index is 2 * t + 1, and results contains the results of func_1(path) for each iteration.**
