The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2 because the loop starts from `i = 2`.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 2. The value of `i` does not need to be adjusted as it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop itself.

State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', `n` must be greater than 2, `dp` is initialized according to the given conditions**
