Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, given the constraints:
- You can buy at most `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets by `x` for all subsequent days.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of days `n`, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day `m`, and the total number of tickets to be bought `k`.
2. Reads the list of ticket prices `l` for each day.
3. Sorts the list of prices in ascending order.
4. Iterates over the sorted list of prices and calculates the total cost `c` to buy `k` tickets while keeping track of the total increase `t` in ticket prices due to previous purchases.
5. For each day, it buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining `k` tickets, calculates the cost for those tickets considering the current price increase, and updates the total cost `c`, the price increase `t`, and the remaining number of tickets `k`.
6. Prints the total cost `c` for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if the logic aligns with the problem requirements:
1. **Sorting the Prices**: Sorting the prices in ascending order ensures that we buy the cheapest tickets first, which minimizes the total cost.
2. **Buying Tickets**: The program buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining `k` tickets each day, which adheres to the constraint of buying no more than `m` tickets per day.
3. **Price Increase**: The price increase `t` is correctly updated after each purchase and applied to the subsequent days' prices.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The cost for each purchase is calculated correctly by multiplying the number of tickets by the current price (original price + price increase).

Given these points, the program seems to follow the correct logic to minimize the total cost of buying `k` tickets. Therefore, the program should work correctly for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
