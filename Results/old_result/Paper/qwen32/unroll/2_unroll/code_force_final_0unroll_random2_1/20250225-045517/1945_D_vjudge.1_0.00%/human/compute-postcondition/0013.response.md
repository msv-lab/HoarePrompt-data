Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `k`, a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n; and `lista_A`, a list of n integers where each element `a_i` represents the cost Kirill has to pay to bribe the i-th person. Additionally, it accepts `lista_B`, a list of n integers where each element `b_i` represents the cost Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th person when bribing the j-th person to position i. The function returns the minimum total cost Kirill has to pay to bribe his way to the k-th position in the queue.**
