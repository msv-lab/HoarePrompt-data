To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, as the loop iterates `t` times.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains `_` and `t`.
2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Its value does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
3. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given this, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The values of `n` and `a` are not directly relevant to whether the loop will execute, but they must be defined appropriately for the loop body to function correctly when it does execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case**
