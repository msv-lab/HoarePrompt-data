Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array and two limits `k` and `x`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after removing up to `k` elements and multiplying up to `x` elements by -1. The function outputs the maximum sum for each test case.**
