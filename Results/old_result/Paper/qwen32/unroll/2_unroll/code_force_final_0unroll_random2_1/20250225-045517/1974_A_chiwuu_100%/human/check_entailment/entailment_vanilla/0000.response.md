Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (a) and 2x2 icons (b). The program then calculates the minimum number of screens required.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `n` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of 1x1 icons `a` and 2x2 icons `b` are read.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is calculated as `t = b // 2`. If `b` is odd, one additional screen is needed, hence `t = b // 2 + 1`.
   - This part seems correct as placing each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and we need to account for the extra screen if there's an odd number of 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   - The total cells used by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`.
   - The remaining cells available after placing 2x2 icons on `t` screens is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - If not, the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons is calculated. If the remaining icons `t2 = a - t1` can fill a full screen (15 cells), then `t2 // 15` additional screens are needed. Otherwise, one more screen is required (`t2 // 15 + 1`).

4. **Output:**
   - The total number of screens `t` is printed for each test case.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the first test case:
- Input: `1 1`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
  - Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons: `1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `11 >= 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (correct)

The logic seems to correctly handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons across the minimum number of screens.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and verifying with an example, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. 

Correctness: **True**
