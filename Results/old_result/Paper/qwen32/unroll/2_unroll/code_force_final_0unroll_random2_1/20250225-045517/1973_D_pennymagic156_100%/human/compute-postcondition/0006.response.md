In the given task, the initial state specifies the presence of variables `n`, `k`, and `v`. However, these variables are not used in the provided Python code snippet. The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string along with a flush operation.

Let's break down the print statement:
- The string `'! -1'` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `v`.

Output: **! -1**
