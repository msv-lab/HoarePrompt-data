The function reads a number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. If `n` is greater than 10000, it outputs `1` followed by `16668`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of operations needed to increase the median of the list `a` to a value greater than its original median and outputs this number of operations.
