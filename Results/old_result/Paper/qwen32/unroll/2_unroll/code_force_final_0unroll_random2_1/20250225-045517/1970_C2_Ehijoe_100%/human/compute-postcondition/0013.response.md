Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `start` is the integer read from the input, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `t` remains the second integer read from the input, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have only one adjacent node (leaf nodes), `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`, and `moves` is False**
