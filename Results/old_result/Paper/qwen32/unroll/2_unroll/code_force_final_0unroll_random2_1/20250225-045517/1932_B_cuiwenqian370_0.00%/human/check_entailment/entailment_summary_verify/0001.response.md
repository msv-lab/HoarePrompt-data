Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The code provided, however, does not implement this logic. Instead, it processes input related to a path with '@' and '*' characters and uses dynamic programming to evaluate some form of scoring or counting based on these characters. This is completely unrelated to the problem of finding the year when each sign occurs sequentially based on the periodicity of each sign.

The function summary provided also supports this assessment. It describes the function `func_2` as reading test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path`, and then processing each test case using the `func_1` function. This summary does not align with the problem description, which requires processing a list of integers representing the periodicity of the signs.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.

Final: **False**
