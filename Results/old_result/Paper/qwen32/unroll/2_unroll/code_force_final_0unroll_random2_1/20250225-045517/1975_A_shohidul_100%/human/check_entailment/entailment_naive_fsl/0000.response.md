Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation any number of times. Specifically, the logic for checking whether the array can be split and swapped to achieve a sorted order is flawed.

Here's a detailed analysis:

1. The program first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it prints "YES".
2. If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first point where the order is violated (i.e., `a[i-1] > a[i]`).
3. Once it finds such a point, it checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new`: This checks if the first element of the array is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix starting from the point where the order is violated.
   - `new_all`: This checks if the suffix starting from the point where the order is violated is sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop. If not, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

The issue with this logic is that it only checks a single split point and does not consider other possible split points that might make the array sortable. For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
3 4 5 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
You can split the array into `x=[3,4,5]` and `y=[1,2]`, then swap them to get `[1,2,3,4,5]`, which is sorted.

However, the provided program will print "NO" for this input because it will only consider the first point where the order is violated (i.e., `a[2] > a[3]`), and it will not find a valid split point that makes the array sortable.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases for splitting and swapping the array to achieve a sorted order.
