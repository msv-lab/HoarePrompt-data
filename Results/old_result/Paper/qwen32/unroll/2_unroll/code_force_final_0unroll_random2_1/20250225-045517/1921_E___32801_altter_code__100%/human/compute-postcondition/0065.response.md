Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`
- `r` is a list of integers
- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x1` is `r[2] + a`
- `y1` is `r[3]`
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`
- `y2` is `r[5]`
- `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are mentioned but not explicitly defined in the initial state.
- Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.
- `(x2 - x1)` is an even number.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, `a` is `m - y1`.
- `b` is `x2 - x1`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('draw')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `a`, or `b`. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'draw'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
