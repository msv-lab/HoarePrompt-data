Given the initial state, the variable `result` is explicitly defined as the string `'1 4 7 9 2 5 8 0 3 6'`. This string is a space-separated representation of the elements in the `permutation` list.

The `print(result)` statement will output the value of the `result` variable directly.

Output: **1 4 7 9 2 5 8 0 3 6**
