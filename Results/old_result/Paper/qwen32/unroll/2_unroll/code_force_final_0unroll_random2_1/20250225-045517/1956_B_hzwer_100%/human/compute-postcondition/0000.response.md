The provided code snippet only includes the line `input = sys.stdin.readline`. This line reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`, which is a more efficient way to read input in Python, especially for large inputs.

Since no further operations are performed on the variables `n` or the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, these remain unchanged. The only change is the reassignment of the `input` variable.

Output State: **Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards you and Nene receive, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The `input` variable is reassigned to `sys.stdin.readline`.**
