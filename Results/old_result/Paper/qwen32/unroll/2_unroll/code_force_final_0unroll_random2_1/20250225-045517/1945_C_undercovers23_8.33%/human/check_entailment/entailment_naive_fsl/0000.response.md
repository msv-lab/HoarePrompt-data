Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the percentages of zeros and ones, which is not necessary for the problem. Instead, it should directly check the counts of zeros and ones on each side of the road.

Here are the issues in the provided code:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The code calculates percentages (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`) which is not required. The problem statement requires checking if the number of zeros on the left side is at least \(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\) and the number of ones on the right side is at least \(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\).

2. **Logic for Counting Zeros and Ones**: The code uses percentage checks instead of directly counting zeros and ones. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        zero, one = 0, s.count('1')
        min_diff = float('inf')
        best_i = -1
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if zero >= (i + 1) / 2 and one >= (n - i) / 2:
                diff = abs(n / 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < best_i):
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_i = i
            if i < n:
                if s[i] == '0':
                    zero += 1
                else:
                    one -= 1
        
        print(best_i)

```

This corrected version directly counts the zeros and ones on each side of the road and checks if they meet the required conditions. It also handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.
