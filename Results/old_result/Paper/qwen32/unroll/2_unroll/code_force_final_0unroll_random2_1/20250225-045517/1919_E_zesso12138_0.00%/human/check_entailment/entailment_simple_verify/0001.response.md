To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to systematically analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotations. Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Problem Breakdown

The problem requires us to determine how many possible arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The prefix sum array `p` is defined as `p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Solution Explanation

The program uses dynamic programming (DP) to solve the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized as an array of size `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to `0`.
   - `offset = n` is used to shift the indices of the `dp` array to handle negative prefix sums.
   - `dp[offset] = 1` indicates that there is one way to achieve a prefix sum of `0` (which is the initial state).

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a` (from `1` to `n`), the algorithm updates the `dp` array.
   - `new_dp` is created to store the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum after considering the current element of `a`.
   - For each possible prefix sum `j` (from `0` to `2 * n`), if there is a way to achieve this sum (`dp[j] > 0`), the algorithm updates `new_dp` for the sums that can be achieved by adding `1` or `-1` to `j`.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the counts do not overflow.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements of `a`, the final prefix sum (which is `p[-1]` in the sorted array) is used to determine the number of ways to achieve this sum.
   - The final sum is adjusted by adding `offset` to handle the shifted index.
   - The result is the value in `dp` at the adjusted final sum index.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Initialization**: The `dp` array is correctly initialized to handle the initial state of the prefix sum being `0`.
- **DP Transition**: The transition logic correctly accounts for the two possible values of `a` (`1` and `-1`), updating the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum.
- **Final Calculation**: The final sum is correctly adjusted by adding `offset` to match the shifted index in the `dp` array.
- **Input Handling**: The input is correctly read and processed for each test case.

### Annotations Review

The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call to `func_1`, `n` is a positive integer and `p` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- Inside `func_1`, `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` representing the number of ways to reach each possible sum after `n` steps, and `offset` is `n`.
- After the DP transitions, `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.

### Testing the Program

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [0]`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No array `a` can produce `p = [0]` as the sorted prefix sum array.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [1]`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The array `a = [1]` produces `p = [1]`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No array `a` can produce `p = [-1, 1, 2]` as the sorted prefix sum array.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Three possible arrays `a` can produce `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The array `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]` produces `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`.

All the examples match the expected outputs, indicating that the program is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the verification with the provided examples, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

**Final: True**
