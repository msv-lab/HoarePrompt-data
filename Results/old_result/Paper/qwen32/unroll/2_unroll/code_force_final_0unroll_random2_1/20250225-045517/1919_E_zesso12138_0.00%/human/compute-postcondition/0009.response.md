The provided loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. Since the loop only involves printing and does not modify any of the variables `n`, `p`, `index`, `t`, or `results` itself, these variables remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing.

The only change is that the contents of `results` will have been printed to the console.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the size of the array `a` from the last iteration, `p` is the list of prefix sums from the last iteration, `index` is the position after the last prefix sums in `data`, `t` is the number of iterations, and `results` is a list of results from each iteration of `func_1(n, p)`. The contents of `results` have been printed.**
