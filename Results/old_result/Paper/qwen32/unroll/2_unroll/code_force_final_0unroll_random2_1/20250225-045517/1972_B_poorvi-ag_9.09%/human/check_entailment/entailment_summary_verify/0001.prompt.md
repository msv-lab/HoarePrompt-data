You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their respective facing directions ("U" for up and "D" for down). For each test case, it checks if the number of coins is odd and if there are more coins facing up than down. If both conditions are met, it outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem describes a game involving coins arranged in a circle. Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who makes the last valid move wins.

### Key Observations:
1. **Even Number of Coins (n % 2 == 0):**
   - If the number of coins is even, it can be shown that Bob will always win if both play optimally. This is because every move Alice makes will result in an odd number of coins, and every move Bob makes will result in an even number of coins. Therefore, Bob will always be the one to make the last move when only one coin remains.
   
2. **Odd Number of Coins (n % 2 != 0):**
   - If the number of coins is odd, the situation is more complex. However, the program seems to use a heuristic based on the count of 'U' and 'D'. Specifically, it checks if the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) is greater than the number of 'D' (facing-down coins). If so, it predicts that Alice will win; otherwise, it predicts that Bob will win. This heuristic is not necessarily correct based on the problem's rules and the optimal play strategy.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of coins and the string representing the coins.
3. If the number of coins is even, it appends 'no' to the results list (indicating Bob wins).
4. If the number of coins is odd, it checks if the count of 'U' is greater than the count of 'D'. If true, it appends 'yes' to the results list (indicating Alice wins); otherwise, it appends 'no' (indicating Bob wins).

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the case where the number of coins is even by predicting Bob as the winner.
- However, the heuristic used for the odd number of coins is not correct. The number of 'U' and 'D' does not directly determine the winner based on the problem's rules and optimal play strategy.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect heuristic for determining the winner when the number of coins is odd. The correct approach would involve a more detailed analysis of the game's mechanics and the players' optimal strategies.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
