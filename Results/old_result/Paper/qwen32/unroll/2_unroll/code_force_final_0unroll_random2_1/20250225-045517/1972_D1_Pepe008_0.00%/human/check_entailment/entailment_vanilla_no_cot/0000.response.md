Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem according to the given problem description and example outputs. The logic in the program seems incorrect and does not properly account for the conditions specified in the problem. The commented-out section appears to be an attempt to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check the condition, but the actual implementation does not do this. Instead, it uses a different formula that does not accurately count the number of valid pairs for the given constraints.
