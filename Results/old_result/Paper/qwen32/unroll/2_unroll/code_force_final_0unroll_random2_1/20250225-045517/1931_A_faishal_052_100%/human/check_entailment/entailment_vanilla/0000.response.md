Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to decode an integer (which represents the sum of positions of three lowercase Latin letters) back into the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word. The letters in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26, with "a" being 1 and "z" being 26.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which is the encoded value of the word. The program then tries to determine the three letters that sum up to `lex` and outputs the lexicographically smallest combination of these letters.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `cases` is read.
   - For each test case, the encoded value `lex` is read.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the three letters.
   - It then enters a loop to determine the positions of the first two letters.
     - If `lex < 28`, it appends `1` to `arr` (since the smallest letter "a" corresponds to 1) and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it appends `26` to `arr` (since the largest letter "z" corresponds to 26) and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it again appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - The remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr` as the position of the third letter.
   - The list `arr` is sorted to ensure the letters are in lexicographically smallest order.
   - The positions in `arr` are converted to corresponding letters and added to a string `temp`.
   - The string `temp` (which represents the decoded word) is printed.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Logic for Determining Letters:**
  - The program incorrectly assumes that if `lex < 28`, the first letter must be "a" and if `lex < 52`, the second letter must be "z". This is not always the case.
  - The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the first two letters and the remaining sum for the third letter. It should aim to minimize the first letter first, then the second letter, and finally determine the third letter.
- **Sorting the Letters:**
  - Sorting the positions of the letters after assigning them does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. The program should directly construct the smallest possible letters without sorting.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating over possible values for the first letter (from "a" to "z").
- For each first letter, iterating over possible values for the second letter.
- The third letter is then determined by subtracting the sum of the first two letters from `lex`.
- Ensuring that the third letter is a valid letter (between 1 and 26).

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the program's logic, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
