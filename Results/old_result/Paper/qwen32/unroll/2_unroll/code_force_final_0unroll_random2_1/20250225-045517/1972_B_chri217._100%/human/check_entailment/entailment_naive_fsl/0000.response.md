Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`). The key insight is that Alice will win if the number of facing-up coins is odd and Bob will win if it is even. This is because each player removes a facing-up coin and flips its adjacent coins, and the parity of the number of facing-up coins determines who will be forced into a losing position.

Here's a breakdown of the program:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads the input, which includes the number of test cases and the details of each test case (number of coins and the string representing the coins). It stores these details in a list of tuples.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function takes a single test case (a tuple containing the number of coins and the string) and counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`). It then returns `'YES'` if the count of `'U'` is odd and `'NO'` if it is even.

The program processes each test case independently and applies the same logic, which is consistent with the problem description. Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program correctly determines the winner for each test case. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided logic.
