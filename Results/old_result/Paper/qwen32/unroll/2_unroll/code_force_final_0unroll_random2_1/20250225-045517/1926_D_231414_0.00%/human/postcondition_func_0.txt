The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. For each integer in the list, it calculates a value based on the XOR operation with a fixed constant (2^31 - 1). It then updates a dictionary to track occurrences of these values and adjusts a counter `ans` to reflect the number of unique values. The function prints the updated counter after processing each integer in the list.
