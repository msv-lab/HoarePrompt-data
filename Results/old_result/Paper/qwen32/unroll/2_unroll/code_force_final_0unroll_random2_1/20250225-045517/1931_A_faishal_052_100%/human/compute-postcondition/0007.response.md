Functionality: **The function processes a number of test cases, each with an integer input `lex` between 3 and 78. For each test case, it calculates a list of three values based on the value of `lex`, sorts this list, and then converts these values into characters by mapping them to the ASCII range of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'). The function prints a string of these three characters for each test case.**
