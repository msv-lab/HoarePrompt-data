The function `solution()` does not take any parameters. The input is provided through standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers x and y, each consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and each having the same length. The number of test cases, t, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The integers x and y satisfy 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100.
