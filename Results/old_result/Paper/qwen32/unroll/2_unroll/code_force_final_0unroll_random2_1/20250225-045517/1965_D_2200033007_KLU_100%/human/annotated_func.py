#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where consecutive duplicate integers are removed by pairs, resulting in the list `[1, 3, 1]`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000. The list odds contains \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) integers, which are all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a of size n.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n` such that 3 <= n <= 1000. The list `odds` contains \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) integers, which are subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`. The function reconstructs and returns the palindrome array `a`.
