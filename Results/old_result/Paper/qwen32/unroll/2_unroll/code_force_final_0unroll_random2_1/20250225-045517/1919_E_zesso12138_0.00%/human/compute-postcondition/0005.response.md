The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. None of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the split input, `index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list.**
