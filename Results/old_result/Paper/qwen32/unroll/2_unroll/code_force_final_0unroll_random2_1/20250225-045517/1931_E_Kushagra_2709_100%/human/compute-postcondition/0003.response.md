The loop iterates over the string `num` from the last character to the first, checking if each character is '0'. If a non-zero character is encountered, the loop breaks. If the character is '0', the variable `tot` is incremented by 1. This process counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9; `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`.**
