### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by iterating through the list of costs and calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions in the queue. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill) and `m` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
   - It then reads two lists: `lista_A` (costs to bribe each person directly) and `lista_B` (additional costs for each person between the bribed person and Kirill).

2. **Reversing Lists**:
   - The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This allows the program to process the costs from the end of the queue towards the front, which is useful for calculating the cumulative costs.

3. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `soma_b` is used to accumulate the sum of `lista_B` values where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]`.
   - `pref` is used to accumulate the total cost when a direct bribe (`lista_A[i]`) is cheaper than the cumulative additional costs (`soma_b`).

4. **Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The program then iterates over the last `k` positions (from `n-k` to `n-1`) and calculates the total cost for Kirill to reach each of these positions.
   - It keeps track of the minimum cost encountered during this iteration.

### Correctness Evaluation:

The logic implemented in the program is correct for the problem described. The program efficiently calculates the minimum cost by leveraging the reversed lists to process the costs from the end of the queue towards the front. It correctly handles the conditions for direct bribes and additional costs, ensuring that Kirill reaches one of the first `m` positions with the minimum possible expenditure.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correctly implemented based on the provided problem description and the logic used. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
