You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then prints two lists, `ans1` and `ans2`, each containing `k` integers, such that each integer in these lists appears exactly once across both lists. The integers are selected based on specific conditions related to their occurrences and positions in the input list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
Given an array `a` of length `2n`, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice, and an integer `k`, the task is to find two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that:
- `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
- The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a` of length `2n`.
2. **Splitting the Array**: The array `a` is split into two parts: `b` (first `n` elements) and `c` (last `n` elements).
3. **Sorting**: Both `b` and `c` are sorted.
4. **Building `l` and `ans1`/`ans2`**:
   - `l` is initialized as an empty list.
   - The program checks the first and last elements of `b` to see if they are unique and adds them to `l` if they are.
   - It then iterates through `b` to find pairs of identical elements, adding these pairs to `ans1` and decrementing `k` by 2 for each pair.
   - It does the same for `c`, adding pairs of identical elements to `ans2`.
   - If `k` is still greater than 0 after processing `b` and `c`, it adds elements from `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2` until `k` reaches 0.
5. **Output**: It prints `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Logic for `l` and `ans1`/`ans2` Construction**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of `ans1` equals the bitwise XOR of `ans2`.
   - The logic for constructing `l` and adding elements to `ans1`/`ans2` is flawed. It does not ensure that the final subsets `ans1` and `ans2` meet the criteria of having equal bitwise XOR.

2. **Handling of Unique Elements**:
   - The program checks the first and last elements of `b` for uniqueness and adds them to `l` if they are unique. However, this does not ensure that the final subsets `ans1` and `ans2` will have equal bitwise XOR.

3. **Final XOR Check**:
   - The program does not perform a final check to ensure that the bitwise XOR of `ans1` equals the bitwise XOR of `ans2`.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not guarantee that the final subsets `ans1` and `ans2` will have equal bitwise XOR, which is a key requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
