### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by generating a random permutation of the given string `s` and checking if it is different from the original string. If a different permutation is found, it outputs "Yes" followed by the permutation; otherwise, it outputs "No".

Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Random Permutation**: The `random.sample(s, len(s))` function generates a random permutation of the string `s`. This means that the order of characters in the permutation is random.

2. **Comparison**: The program checks if the generated permutation `s2` is different from the original string `s`. If they are different, it prints "Yes" and the permutation; otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Multiple Permutations**: Given the random nature of `random.sample`, there is a possibility that the generated permutation might be the same as the original string. However, the problem statement does not require the program to guarantee a different permutation on every run, only that it should find a different permutation if one exists.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input string consists of a single character or when all characters in the string are the same (e.g., "aaaaa"). In the latter case, no permutation can be different from the original string, and the program correctly outputs "No".

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs "Yes" or "No" (case-insensitive) as required, and it outputs the permutation on a new line when "Yes" is printed.

Based on the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements. However, there is a subtle issue with the randomness aspect. If the input string has a very low number of unique characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the probability of generating a different permutation is low, but the program does correctly handle such cases by outputting "No" when no different permutation is found.
