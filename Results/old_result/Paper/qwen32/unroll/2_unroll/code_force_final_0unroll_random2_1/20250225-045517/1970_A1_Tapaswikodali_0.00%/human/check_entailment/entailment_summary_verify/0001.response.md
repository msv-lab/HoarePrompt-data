### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position in the input string `s`. The balance is incremented for each opening parenthesis `(` and decremented for each closing parenthesis `)`.

2. **Storing Details**:
   - The program stores a tuple for each character in the string, containing the prefix balance, the negative of the position, and the character itself. This ensures that when sorting, positions with the same prefix balance are sorted in decreasing order by using the negative position.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list of tuples is sorted primarily by the prefix balance in increasing order and secondarily by the negative position in increasing order (which corresponds to the original position in decreasing order). This matches the problem description's criteria for sorting.

4. **Forming the Result**:
   - The program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted list of tuples. This results in the correct balanced shuffle sequence as per the problem statement.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the constructed result string.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Prefix Balance**:
  - The program accurately computes the prefix balance for each character in the string.
  
- **Sorting Criteria**:
  - The sorting criteria match the problem description: first by prefix balance in increasing order, and then by position in decreasing order for ties.
  
- **Result Construction**:
  - The program correctly constructs the result string by taking the characters from the sorted list of tuples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It accurately computes the prefix balance, sorts the characters according to the specified criteria, and constructs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.
