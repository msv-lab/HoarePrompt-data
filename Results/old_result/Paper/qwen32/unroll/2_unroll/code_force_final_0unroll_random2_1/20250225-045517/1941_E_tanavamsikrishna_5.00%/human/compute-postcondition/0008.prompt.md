You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of rows, m is a positive integer representing the number of columns, k is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the river grid and contains m integers, with the first and last integers being 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, `total_costs` (where `total_costs` is a list of sums of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list).
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every k consecutive elements from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, which are positive integers representing the number of rows, number of columns, number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. It also accepts a 2D list `rows` of integers where each sublist represents a row in the river grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers being 0. The function returns a value indicating whether it is possible to place `k` bridges in the grid such that the maximum distance between supports does not exceed `d`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
