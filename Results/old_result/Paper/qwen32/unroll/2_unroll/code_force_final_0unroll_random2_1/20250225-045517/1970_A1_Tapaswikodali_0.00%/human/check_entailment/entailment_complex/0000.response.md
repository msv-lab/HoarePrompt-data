### Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the described balanced shuffle operation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program starts by initializing `balance` to 0 and an empty list `details`.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - It iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the `balance` based on whether the character is "(" (increment balance) or ")" (decrement balance).
   - It appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list. The `-i` ensures that in case of a tie in the balance, the positions are sorted in decreasing order.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The `details` list, which now contains tuples of (balance, -position, character), is sorted. This sorting respects the rules defined in the problem: first by balance in increasing order, and then by position in decreasing order (due to the negative sign).

4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.

5. **Output**:
   - The resulting string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence, is printed.

### Correctness:
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly performs the balanced shuffle operation as specified. The sorting mechanism ensures that the resulting sequence maintains the required properties of a balanced parentheses sequence, and the output matches the expected result for the provided example.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

**Correctness: True**
