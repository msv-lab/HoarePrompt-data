Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the encoded value of a 3-letter word.
2. **Output**: For each test case, the program should output the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`.
3. **Encoding**: The encoding of a word is the sum of the positions of its characters in the alphabet (where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the values corresponding to the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` (since the smallest possible letter is 'a') and reduces `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` (since the largest possible letter is 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Conversion**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted to ensure the smallest possible lexicographical order.
   - The sorted values in `arr` are then converted to corresponding letters by adding 96 (to convert from 1-based index to ASCII) and joined to form a string `temp`.

4. **Output**:
   - The resulting string `temp` is printed for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic**:
   - The loop runs only twice, which means it can only handle cases where the sum of the first two letters is at most 52. For sums up to 78, it incorrectly appends 26 twice, which is not always the smallest possible combination.
   - The logic does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the first two letters is less than 52 but more than 26. It should handle each letter independently to find the smallest possible combination.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the list `arr` after appending values does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical word. The values should be chosen in a way that respects the order of letters in the alphabet.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the decoding logic and the way the values are chosen, the program does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for a given encoded value.

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, a more systematic approach should be taken to find the smallest possible combination of three letters that sum up to the given encoded value, ensuring that the letters are chosen in lexicographical order.
