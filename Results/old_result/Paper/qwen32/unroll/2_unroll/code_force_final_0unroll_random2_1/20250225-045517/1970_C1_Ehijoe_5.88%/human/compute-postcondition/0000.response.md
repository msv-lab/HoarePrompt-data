Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. Since `t` is specified to be 1, it remains unchanged. The initial conditions regarding the tree and the starting node for each round are still valid as the code does not modify them.
