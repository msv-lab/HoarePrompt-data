To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the given code does in each iteration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n+1` to zero. Then, for each integer `x` in the list `a`, it increments `cnt[x]` by 1. This counts how many times each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list.
3. **Calculating the Answer**: It initializes `ans` to 0. Then, for each count `x` in the `cnt` array, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`. This effectively counts the number of duplicates for each integer in the list.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

Since the code processes each test case independently, the output state after all iterations will be a series of printed values, each corresponding to the number of duplicate integers in the respective test case's list.

Since the problem statement asks for the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, and the output is a series of printed values, the "output state" can be described as the sequence of these printed values.

However, since we are asked to describe the output state in a specific format and the output is not stored in a variable but rather printed, we can describe it as the final state of the printed results.

Given that the problem does not specify how many test cases there are or what their specific inputs are, the output state can be described generally as a sequence of integers, each representing the number of duplicate integers in the respective test case's list.

Thus, the output state after all executions of the loop have finished can be described as:

Output State: **a sequence of integers, each representing the number of duplicate integers in the respective test case's list.**
