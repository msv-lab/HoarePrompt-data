To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the loop's range parameters.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if the range `(n, 0, -1)` is valid, meaning `n` must be greater than 0 because the loop starts at `n` and decrements `i` down to 1.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already defined as being in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), it is already valid for the loop to start.
2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized to `n` in the first iteration. We do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts because it is set by the range function.
3. **`k`**: The variable `k` is not used in the loop head and does not affect whether the loop executes. However, it is part of the initial state, so we should include it in the final state description.
4. **`v`**: The variable `v` is set to 1 and is not used in the loop head. Like `k`, it does not affect whether the loop executes, but it should be included in the final state description.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts that ensures the loop will execute is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `v` is 1**.
