### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Answer**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This is correct because for \(b = 1\), any \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) satisfies the condition since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

3. **Loop for \(b > 1\)**:
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\) and adds this to `ans`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). This formula is incorrect because it assumes that \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) for all \(a\), which is not true. The \(\gcd(a, b)\) can be any divisor of \(b\), and the formula should account for all possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\).

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program initializes `ans` to `n` and then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.
- The annotations do not challenge the correctness of the formula used within the loop, but the logic of the formula itself is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not properly account for the \(\gcd(a, b)\) in the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
