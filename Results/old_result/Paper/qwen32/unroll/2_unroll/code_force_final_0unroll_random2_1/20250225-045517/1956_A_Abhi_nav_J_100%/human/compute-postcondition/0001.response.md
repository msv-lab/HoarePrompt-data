Output State: **The program returns a - 1, which is not a valid operation for a list.**

However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the operation `a - 1` as it is not valid for lists in Python. Assuming the intention is to subtract 1 from each element in the list `a`, the corrected operation would be a list comprehension. Given the task constraints, I will provide the output state based on that assumption.

Corrected Code Assumption:
```
return [x - 1 for x in a]
```

Output State: **The program returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.**
