Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by sorting the integers and then pairing the smallest available integers together. By sorting the list in ascending order, the program ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible given the remaining choices, which is optimal for maximizing the score. The program handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement and outputs the correct result for each test case based on the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
