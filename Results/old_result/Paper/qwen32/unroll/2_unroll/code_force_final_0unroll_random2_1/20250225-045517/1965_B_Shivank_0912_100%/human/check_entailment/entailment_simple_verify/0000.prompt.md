You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: `t` retains the value of the number of test cases, `n` and `k` retain the values of the last test case, and `i` and `ans` do not exist.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the given program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that no subsequence of `a` sums to `k`, while every integer from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be obtained as a sum of some subsequence of `a`.

Here's the code again for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)
```

Let's break down the program logic:
1. The program starts by finding the largest power of 2 less than `k` using the variable `i`.
2. It then constructs a list `ans` with some specific values:
   - `k - (1 << i)`
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
   - All powers of 2 except the `i`-th power.
3. The program prints the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Subsequence Sum to `k`:** The program needs to ensure that no subsequence of `ans` sums to `k`. The current construction does not guarantee this. For example, if `k` is a power of 2, the construction might not prevent a subsequence from summing to `k`.
2. **Subsequence Sum to All Values from 1 to `n` (except `k`):** The program needs to ensure that every integer from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be obtained as a sum of some subsequence of `ans`. The current construction does not guarantee this either.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Let's consider the input `n = 10` and `k = 3`:
- The largest power of 2 less than 3 is `1` (i.e., `i = 0`).
- The constructed list `ans` would be `[2, 4, 5, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`.
- This list does not guarantee that every integer from 1 to 10 (except 3) can be obtained as a sum of some subsequence of `ans`.
- Additionally, it's possible that some subsequence might sum to `3`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee that it meets the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
