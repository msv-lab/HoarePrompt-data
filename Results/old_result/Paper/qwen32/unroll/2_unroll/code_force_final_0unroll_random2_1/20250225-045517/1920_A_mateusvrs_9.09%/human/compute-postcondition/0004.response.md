Let's analyze the given task step-by-step.

### Initial State:
The initial state describes a list `[result1, result2, ..., resultt]`. This indicates that there is a list named `r` (as implied by the print statement) which contains a sequence of elements, `result1` through `resultt`.

### Python Code Snippet:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(*r, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
- The `*r` syntax in the `print` statement is used to unpack the list `r`. This means that each element of the list `r` will be passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
- The `sep='\n'` argument specifies that the separator between the printed elements should be a newline character.

### Output:
Given the initial state, the list `r` contains elements `result1, result2, ..., resultt`. When the `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement is executed, each element of the list `r` will be printed on a new line.

Therefore, the output will be:
```
result1
result2
...
resultt
```

### Final Answer:
Output: **result1
result2
...
resultt (where each resulti is an element of the list r)**
