Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a min-heap `heap`, a list `remaining_items`, and several other lists and variables (`n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`). It sorts the `combined` list by bonus values, and based on the values of `n` and `k`, it calculates the maximum profit for Bob and Alice by strategically selecting items from the `heap` and `remaining_items`. The function returns the `max_profit` which is the highest profit that can be achieved under the given constraints.**
