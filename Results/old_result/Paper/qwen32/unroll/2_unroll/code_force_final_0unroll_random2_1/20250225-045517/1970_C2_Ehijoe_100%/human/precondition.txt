nodes is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of a tree with n nodes (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), where each inner list contains integers representing the neighbors of a node. start is an integer representing the starting node (1 <= start <= n). parent is an optional parameter used in the DFS traversal to keep track of the parent node, initially set to None.
