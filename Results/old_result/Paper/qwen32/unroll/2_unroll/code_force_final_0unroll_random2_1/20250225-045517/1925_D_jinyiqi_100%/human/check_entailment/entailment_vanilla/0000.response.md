Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input and Output:**
   - Input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we have the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
   - We are also given the friendship values for each pair of friends.
   - The output for each test case should be the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and then \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

2. **Logic:**
   - For each test case, we need to consider the probability of picking a pair of friends and how the friendship values change over the excursions.
   - The expected value calculation involves considering the probability of picking a specific pair and the increase in friendship values over time.
   - The expected value can be calculated based on the number of pairs, the number of excursions, and the initial friendship values.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Calculating Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends (`sum_f`).

3. **Calculating Total Number of Possible Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs of children (`cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`).

4. **Calculating Numerator (`p`) and Denominator (`q`):**
   - The program calculates `p` and `q` based on the formula:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot cn2^2
     \]
   - It then simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).

5. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9+7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then calculates the result as `p * q^{-1} % M` and prints it.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the logic and calculations in the program match the problem requirements.

- **Sum of Initial Friendship Values (`sum_f`):** Correctly calculated.
- **Total Number of Possible Pairs (`cn2`):** Correctly calculated.
- **Numerator (`p`) and Denominator (`q`):** The formula used seems to be incorrect based on the problem description. The expected value calculation involves more complex probability and combinatorial considerations that are not accurately represented by the given formula.
- **Simplification and Modular Inverse:** Correctly implemented given the formula, but the formula itself is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation based on the problem description. The formula used for `p` and `q` does not accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
