Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n` and `m`. Specifically, it computes a sum `suma` by iterating through values from 1 to `b` and adjusting `suma` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, then prints `suma - 1`.**
