Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each test case. The logic for distributing the encoded sum across the three letters is flawed. Here are some specific issues:

1. The program does not correctly handle the distribution of the sum across the three letters to ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.
2. The program incorrectly checks conditions for subtracting 1 or 26 from the encoded sum, and it does not properly account for all possible combinations.
3. The sorting of the array `arr` after distributing the values does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

To fix the program, a more systematic approach is needed to distribute the encoded sum across the three letters while ensuring the word is lexicographically smallest. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        n -= 3  # Subtract 3 because we start with 'aaa'
        
        # Distribute the remaining sum across the three letters
        if n > 0:
            b += min(n, 25)
            n -= min(n, 25)
        if n > 0:
            c += n
        
        # Convert to letters
        word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(word)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest possible letters are used first and distributes the remaining sum in a way that maintains the lexicographical order.
