### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged to form a specific "progressive square" matrix based on the rules provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `c`, and `d`, which define the size of the matrix and the parameters for constructing the progressive square.
   - It then reads a list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Determine `a_{1,1}`:**
   - The program identifies `a` as the minimum value in the list `l`. This value corresponds to `a_{1,1}` in the problem statement, which is the smallest element in the progressive square.

3. **Construct the Progressive Square:**
   - The program constructs a list `li` of `n^2` integers where each integer is calculated using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This formula generates the elements of the progressive square based on the rules provided.

4. **Comparison:**
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted list `l` is equal to the sorted list `li`. If they are equal, it means the list `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the program returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Correctness:

The logic of the program is correct based on the problem statement. The progressive square is uniquely determined by the values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the minimum element `a_{1,1}`. The program correctly identifies `a_{1,1}` as the minimum value in the list `l`, constructs the progressive square using the formula, and checks if the sorted list of elements matches the sorted progressive square.

Thus, the program will correctly determine whether the given list of integers can be rearranged to form the specified progressive square for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
