Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no direct parameters. Instead, it processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. For each test case, it receives a binary string `s` of length between 2 and 200,000, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns the result for each test case based on the processing of the binary string `s`.**
