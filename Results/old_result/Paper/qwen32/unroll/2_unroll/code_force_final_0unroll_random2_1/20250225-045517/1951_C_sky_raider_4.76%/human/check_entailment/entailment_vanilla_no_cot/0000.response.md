Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The program incorrectly calculates the cost of buying tickets. The cost should be based on the current price of the ticket plus the accumulated increase due to previous purchases, not a simple linear function as implemented.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Tickets**: The program does not correctly handle the remaining tickets (`k`) and the number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`). It incorrectly assumes that the number of tickets to be bought each day is the minimum of `m` and `k`, but it does not properly update the prices for subsequent days.

3. **Incorrect Accumulation of Cost**: The program uses a variable `c` to accumulate the cost, but it adds an incorrect value (`l[i] * s - s * s / 2`) which does not reflect the actual cost of buying tickets with the increased prices.

4. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list of prices, which is not necessary for solving the problem optimally. The optimal strategy involves buying tickets on the days with the lowest prices first, but the program does not correctly implement this strategy due to the other issues mentioned.

To solve the problem correctly, a more appropriate approach would involve using a greedy strategy to buy tickets on the days with the lowest prices, while keeping track of the accumulated price increase due to previous purchases. This can be efficiently done using a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the day with the current lowest price.
