Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix any number of times. The logic in the program is flawed, especially the part where it checks the new array after the split.

Here are a few issues with the program:

1. The program only checks if the array can be split at the first point where the order is violated and then checks if the new array formed after the swap is sorted. This is incorrect because the array can be split at multiple points, and the correct split point might not be the first point where the order is violated.

2. The condition `check_all_new` is checking if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array (suffix). This is not the correct condition to check. The correct condition should be that the last element of the prefix should be less than or equal to the first element of the suffix.

3. The program prints 'NO' as soon as it finds a split point that does not satisfy the conditions, without checking other possible split points.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to find if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the last element of the prefix is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix, and both parts are individually sorted. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    prefix = a[:i]
                    suffix = a[i:]
                    if all(prefix[j - 1] <= prefix[j] for j in range(1, len(prefix))) and \
                       all(suffix[j - 1] <= suffix[j] for j in range(1, len(suffix))) and \
                       (not prefix or not suffix or prefix[-1] <= suffix[0]):
                        print('YES')
                        break
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks for all possible split points and verifies the conditions correctly.
