Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Alice's Moves**:
   - Alice can move her chip one cell down, down-right, or down-left.
   - Alice wins if she places her chip in a cell occupied by Bob's chip.
   - Alice cannot move if she is in the last row (`x_a = h`).

2. **Bob's Moves**:
   - Bob can move his chip one cell up, up-right, or up-left.
   - Bob wins if he places his chip in a cell occupied by Alice's chip.
   - Bob cannot move if he is in the first row (`x_b = 1`).

3. **Game Outcome**:
   - The game ends in a draw if neither player can make a move or if neither player can force a win.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`.

2. **Determine the Outcome**:
   - If `xa > xb`, Alice is initially below Bob. In this case, Alice cannot win because she cannot move up, and Bob can always move down, so the outcome is a draw.
   - If `xa <= xb`, Alice is initially above or at the same row as Bob (though the problem guarantees `xa != xb`, so `xa < xb`).
     - Calculate `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`, which represents the maximum number of moves Alice can make to reach the same row as Bob.
     - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true (i.e., the difference in rows is odd):
       - Calculate `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`, which represent the range of columns Bob can reach in `x` moves.
       - If Alice can reach any column in the range `[l, r]` in `x + 1` moves, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.
     - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is false (i.e., the difference in rows is even):
       - Calculate `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`, which represent the range of columns Alice can reach in `x` moves.
       - If Bob can reach any column in the range `[l, r]` in `x` moves, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

### Correctness

The program's logic seems to correctly determine the outcome of the game based on the given conditions. Here are some points to note:

- **Initial Position Comparison**:
  - If `xa > xb`, Alice cannot win, so the program correctly outputs "Draw".
  
- **Range Calculation**:
  - The range `[l, r]` correctly represents the columns that Bob (for odd row differences) or Alice (for even row differences) can reach in the specified number of moves.

- **Win Conditions**:
  - The program correctly checks if Alice or Bob can reach the other's column within the allowed moves to determine the winner.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the outcome of the game for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
