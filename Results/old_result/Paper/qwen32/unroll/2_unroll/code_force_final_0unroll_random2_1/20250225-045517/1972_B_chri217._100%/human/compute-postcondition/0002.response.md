Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `case`, which is a tuple. The first element of the tuple is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U' and 'D', where 'U' represents a coin facing up and 'D' represents a coin facing down. The function returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters in the string is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.**
