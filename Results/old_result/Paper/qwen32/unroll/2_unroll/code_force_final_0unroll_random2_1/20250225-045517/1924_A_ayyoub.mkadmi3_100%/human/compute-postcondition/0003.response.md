The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which will take on each character of the string `s` in each iteration. Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, the state of `s` determines whether the loop will execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, `s` must have at least one character. The states of `s1`, `s2`, and `alphabet` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so we do not need to adjust them for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `s` has at least one character.

State: **`s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, where `m` must be at least 1, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**
