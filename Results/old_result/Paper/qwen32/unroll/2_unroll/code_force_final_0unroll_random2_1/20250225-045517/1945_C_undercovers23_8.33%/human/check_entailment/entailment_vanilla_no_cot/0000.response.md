Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Percentage Calculation Error**: The program calculates the percentage of zeros and ones in the left and right sections of the road incorrectly. Instead of calculating the exact number of zeros and ones that should be present to satisfy the condition, it calculates percentages and compares them to 50, which is not the intended logic.

2. **Condition Check**: The condition to check if the road can be placed between houses `i` and `i+1` should be based on whether the number of zeros on the left is at least `ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and the number of ones on the right is at least `ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)`. The current implementation incorrectly uses percentages.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house correctly. It only checks for positions between houses.

4. **Finding the Optimal Position**: The program finds the optimal position by minimizing the absolute difference from the middle, but it does not correctly handle the case where no valid position is found between houses, and it does not correctly handle the edge cases for placing the road before the first house or after the last house.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        zero, one = 0, s.count('1')
        best_i = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one -= 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                diff = abs(n // 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < best_i):
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_i = i
        
        if best_i == -1:
            if s.count('1') >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                best_i = n
            else:
                best_i = 0
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the conditions for placing the road and handles all edge cases, including placing the road before the first house or after the last house.
