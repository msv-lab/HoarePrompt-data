### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the given program to determine if the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Answer**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This implies that it assumes all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid, which is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(a + b = a + 1\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot a = a\), and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(a\) when \(a = 1\).

3. **Loop for \(b > 1\)**:
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\) and adds this to `ans`.

#### Evaluation of the Program's Logic:

The key part of the program that needs scrutiny is the loop where it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\). The logic here is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that \(\gcd(a, b)\) is always 1 for all \(a\) and \(b\). However, \(\gcd(a, b)\) can be any divisor of \(b\), and the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be checked for each possible \(\gcd(a, b)\).

The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and checking the condition for each valid pair \((a, b)\). The given program does not do this and instead uses a simplified formula that does not account for the varying values of \(\gcd(a, b)\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula used does not properly account for the \(\gcd(a, b)\) in the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
