The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `info`. No other variables are modified, and the initial conditions for `cases` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, and for each of the `cases` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 78; `info` is an empty list.**
