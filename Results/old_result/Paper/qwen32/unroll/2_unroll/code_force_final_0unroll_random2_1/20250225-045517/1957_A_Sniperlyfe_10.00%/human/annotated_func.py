#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers where the first element represents the number of test cases. Each test case is followed by an integer indicating the number of stick lengths and then the stick lengths themselves. The function calculates and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 4.
