### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how they work and whether they correctly solve the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the number of ways to reach the final sum `p[-1]` after `n` steps, using a dynamic programming approach.
   - **Mechanism**: 
     - Initializes a `dp` array of size `2 * n + 1` to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible sum. The `offset` of `n` is used to handle negative sums by shifting the range from `[-n, n]` to `[0, 2 * n]`.
     - Iterates over each step from `1` to `n`, updating the `dp` array based on the possible transitions (either adding `1` or subtracting `1`).
     - The final result is the value in `dp` corresponding to the sum `p[-1] + n`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases by reading input, processing each case using `func_1`, and printing the results.
   - **Mechanism**:
     - Reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
     - Parses the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads `n` and the list `p`, then calls `func_1` to compute the number of valid arrays `a` for the given `p`.
     - Collects the results and prints them.

### Analysis:

- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is appropriate for solving the problem. It correctly models the transitions between prefix sums and efficiently computes the number of ways to achieve the final sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` effectively handles multiple test cases by reading all input at once and processing each test case sequentially. This is efficient given the constraints.
- **Correctness of Output**: The output of `func_1` is used directly as the result for each test case in `func_2`, and the results are printed modulo `998,244,353` as required.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid arrays `a` that produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p` for each test case, and it handles the constraints efficiently.

### Correctness: **True**
