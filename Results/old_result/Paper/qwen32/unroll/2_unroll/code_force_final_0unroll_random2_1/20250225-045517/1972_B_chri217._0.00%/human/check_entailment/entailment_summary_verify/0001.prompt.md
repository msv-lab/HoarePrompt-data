You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input, which consists of 'U' and 'D' characters representing coins facing up and down, respectively. It returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd, and 'NO' if the number of 'U' characters is even.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution provided.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around a circular arrangement of coins that can be either facing up ('U') or down ('D'). Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine if Alice (who goes first) will win if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **Game Termination**: The game will always terminate because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins.
2. **Winning Condition**: The winner is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') at the start of the game.
   - If the number of 'U' is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of 'U' is even, Bob wins.

### Explanation of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' in the string `s` representing the coins. It then checks the parity of this count:
- If the count is odd, it prints "YES" (indicating Alice wins).
- If the count is even, it prints "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

### Verification:
The program correctly implements the above logic. It correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which is the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem description and the provided program, the program is correct. It accurately determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy derived from the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic that Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and Bob wins if the number of facing-up coins is even. This logic is derived from the optimal play strategy for both players.
