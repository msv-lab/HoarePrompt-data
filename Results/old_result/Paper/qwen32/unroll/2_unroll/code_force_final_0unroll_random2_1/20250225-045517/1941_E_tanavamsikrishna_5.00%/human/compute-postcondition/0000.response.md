The code snippet provided reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. These variables were previously described as representing the number of rows, number of columns, number of bridges, and maximum distance between supports, respectively. The 2D list `rows` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the river grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers being 0.**
