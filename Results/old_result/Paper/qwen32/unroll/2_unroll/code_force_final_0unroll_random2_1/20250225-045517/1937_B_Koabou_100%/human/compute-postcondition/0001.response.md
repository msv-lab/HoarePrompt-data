The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the input. This integer represents the length of the grid for each test case. The variable `a` is an empty list and remains unchanged by this code snippet. The value of `t` (the number of test cases) and the subsequent lines of input (which include the values for `n` and the binary strings) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of the grid for a test case; `a` is an empty list.**
