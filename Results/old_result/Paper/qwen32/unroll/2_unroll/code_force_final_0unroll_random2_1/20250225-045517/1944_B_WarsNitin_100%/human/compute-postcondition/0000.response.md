The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer provided by the input, but it will still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 5000. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4 and 1 <= k <= floor(n/2); `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.**
