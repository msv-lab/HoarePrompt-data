The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 for each test case. After executing this code, the value of `n` will be the integer input provided, and it will replace the previous value of `n` as specified in the initial state. The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.**
