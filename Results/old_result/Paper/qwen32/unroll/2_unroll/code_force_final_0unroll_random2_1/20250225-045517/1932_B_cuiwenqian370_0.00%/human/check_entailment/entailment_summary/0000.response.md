Reasoning:  
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem described. The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The functions provided, however, seem to be solving a different problem related to counting '@' characters in a path while avoiding '*'.

- `func_1` is designed to find the maximum number of '@' characters in a list of characters, resetting the count if a '*' is encountered.
- `func_2` reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number and a string, and applies `func_1` to each string, then prints the results.

Since neither of these functions addresses the problem of determining the year of the n-th sign's occurrence based on their periodicity, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
