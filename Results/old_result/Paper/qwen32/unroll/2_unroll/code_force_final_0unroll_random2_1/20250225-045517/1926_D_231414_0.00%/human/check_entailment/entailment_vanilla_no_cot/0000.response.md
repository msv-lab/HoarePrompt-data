Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic of the program is flawed, particularly in how it attempts to determine the minimum number of groups required. The program uses a dictionary to keep track of certain values, but it does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that no two numbers in the same group share any matching bits from 1st to 31st bit.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Use of XOR Operation**: The program uses the XOR operation with `check` (which is `2 ** 31 - 1` or all 1s in the 31 least significant bits) to invert the bits of each number. This operation is not helping in grouping the numbers correctly as per the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Grouping Logic**: The program attempts to decrement the answer (`ans`) when it finds a number that can be grouped with another based on the dictionary, but this logic is flawed. It does not correctly ensure that no two numbers in the same group share any matching bits.

3. **Incorrect Output Timing**: The program prints the answer (`ans`) inside the loop that processes each number in the test case, which is incorrect. The answer should be printed only after processing all numbers in a test case.

4. **Dictionary Usage**: The dictionary (`dic`) is used in a way that does not align with the problem requirements. The dictionary should be used to track the unique bit patterns of the numbers, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    times = int(input())
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        bit_patterns = set()
        for number in data:
            # Convert the number to a 31-bit binary string and add to the set
            bit_pattern = format(number, '031b')
            bit_patterns.add(bit_pattern)
        # The number of unique bit patterns is the minimum number of groups required
        print(len(bit_patterns))

func()
```

This corrected version uses a set to track unique 31-bit binary patterns of the numbers. The size of the set at the end of processing each test case gives the minimum number of groups required.
