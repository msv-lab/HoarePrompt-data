The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which means the variable `n` will be assigned the integer value of the input provided. The initial state includes the variable `t` which is an integer between 1 and 1440, and `day` which is 'AM'. The string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" is also part of the initial state for each of the `t` test cases, but its specific value is not provided and is not affected by this code snippet.

The variable `n` is introduced and assigned a value based on the user input, which is converted to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `day`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` is 'AM', and `n` is an input integer.**
