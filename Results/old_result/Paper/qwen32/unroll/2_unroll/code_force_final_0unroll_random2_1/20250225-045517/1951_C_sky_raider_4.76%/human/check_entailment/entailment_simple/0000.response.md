Reasoning: 

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the execution states given in the comments. Let's break down why:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the list of prices (`l.sort()`). This is a good start since we want to buy tickets at the lowest possible price. However, after sorting, the prices do not reflect the increasing cost due to the purchase of tickets on previous days.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost (`c`)**: The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`. This does not represent any meaningful initial cost in the problem context. The cost `c` is supposed to accumulate the total cost of buying tickets, but the initial value is arbitrary and incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Tickets to Buy (`s`)**: The variable `s` is set to `min(m, k)` in each iteration. This is correct for determining the maximum number of tickets that can be bought on the current day without exceeding the daily limit or the remaining tickets needed. However, the cost calculation following this is incorrect.

4. **Cost Accumulation**: The cost is supposed to be accumulated as `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This formula does not make sense in the context of the problem. The term `s * s / 2` is subtracted from the cost, which is not justified based on the problem's rules. The correct formula should simply be `c += l[i] * s`, where `l[i]` is the price of a ticket on the current day after considering the price increases from previous purchases.

5. **Price Increase**: The problem specifies that the price of tickets increases based on the number of tickets bought on previous days. However, the program does not account for this correctly after sorting the prices. The sorted list no longer reflects the actual prices on each day, and the price increase logic is not properly implemented.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to purchase the tickets as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
