Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct.**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been updated to the integer value provided by the input. The conditions about the test cases and the strings remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state description and are not affected by the input operation.
