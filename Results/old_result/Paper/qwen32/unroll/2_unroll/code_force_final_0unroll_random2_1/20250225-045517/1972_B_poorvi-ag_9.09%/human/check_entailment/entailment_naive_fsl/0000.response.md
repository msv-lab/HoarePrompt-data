Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of coins and the count of "U" and "D" coins. The logic used in the program does not account for the optimal moves that Alice and Bob can make.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
UUU
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Correct Game Play:**
1. Alice chooses the first coin, and the string becomes "DDU".
2. Bob chooses the last coin, and the string becomes "D".
3. Alice chooses the only coin and wins.

However, the program will output "NO" because the number of coins (3) is odd and the count of "U" (initially 3) is not greater than the count of "D" (initially 0).

Another counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
UDD
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Correct Game Play:**
1. Alice chooses the first coin, and the string becomes "DDD".
2. Bob cannot make a move because there are no "U" coins left, so Alice wins.

However, the program will output "NO" because the number of coins (3) is odd and the count of "U" (initially 1) is not greater than the count of "D" (initially 2).

These counterexamples show that the program does not correctly determine the winner for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
