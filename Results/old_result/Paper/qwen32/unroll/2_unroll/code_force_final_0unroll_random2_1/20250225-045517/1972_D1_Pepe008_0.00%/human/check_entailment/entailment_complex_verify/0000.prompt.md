You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:

    #State: The output state consists of T lines, each containing the result of the computation `suma - 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n` and `m`. Specifically, it computes a sum `suma` by iterating through values from 1 to `b` and adjusting `suma` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program seems to have a logical error in the way it calculates the number of valid pairs. Let's break it down:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases \(T\) is read.
   - For each test case, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are read.

2. **Logic for Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\).
   - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Potential Issues
The logic in the provided program seems to be incorrect. The formula used to calculate the number of valid pairs does not align with the problem statement. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly translated into the formula used in the code.

### Example Test Cases
Let's consider the example test cases to see if the program works correctly:

1. **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
   - Only pair is \((1, 1)\).
   - \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
   - Correct output: 1.
   - Program output: 1.

2. **Test Case 2**: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
   - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\).
   - Correct output: 3.
   - Program output: 3.

3. **Test Case 3**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
   - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\).
   - Correct output: 14.
   - Program output: 14.

### Conclusion
While the provided program seems to produce correct results for the given example test cases, the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs does not seem to be derived from the problem statement. The formula used might not be correct for all possible values of \(n\) and \(m\).

### Finding a Counterexample
Let's consider a more complex test case to see if the program fails:

- **Test Case**: \(n = 100\), \(m = 100\)
  - The correct number of valid pairs can be calculated by iterating over all pairs and checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The provided program might not produce the correct result for this test case due to the incorrect logic.

### Final Answer
Given the analysis, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses a formula that does not correctly translate the problem statement into a valid solution for all possible values of \(n\) and \(m\). While it may work for some test cases, it is not a general solution.
