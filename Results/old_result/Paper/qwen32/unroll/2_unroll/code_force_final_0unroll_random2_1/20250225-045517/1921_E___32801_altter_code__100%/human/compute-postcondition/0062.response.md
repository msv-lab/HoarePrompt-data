The value of `x1` is incremented by `a`. Given the conditions, `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list of integers, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `(x2 - x1)` is an even number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`.**
