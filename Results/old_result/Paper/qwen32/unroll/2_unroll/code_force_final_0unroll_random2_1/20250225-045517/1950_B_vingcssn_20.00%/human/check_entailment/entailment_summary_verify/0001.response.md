Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The given program explicitly handles only the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For any `n` greater than 4, it outputs "No esta en el rango," which is not in line with the problem description that requires a 2n x 2n checkerboard to be printed for all values of `n` between 1 and 20. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the full range of valid inputs as specified in the problem statement.

The function summary also confirms this limitation by stating that for `n` not within the range 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango," which is consistent with the program's behavior. Since the program does not generate the correct output for all valid inputs, it cannot be considered correct.

Final: **False**
