The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low <= high`. 

Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `min(n, b)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `low` is already 0, we need to ensure that `high` is at least 0. Given that `high` is defined as `min(n, b)`, it is already guaranteed to be non-negative as long as `n` and `b` are non-negative integers, which is a reasonable assumption for the context of the problem.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for `low` and `high` to satisfy the condition `low <= high`.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. `low` is 0, `high` is `min(n, b)`, `max_profit` is 0**
