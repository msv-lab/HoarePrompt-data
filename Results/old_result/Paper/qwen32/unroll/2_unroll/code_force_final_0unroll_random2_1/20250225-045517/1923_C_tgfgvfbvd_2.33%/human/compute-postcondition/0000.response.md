The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not going to be used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the integer value obtained from `int(input())`, which corresponds to the number of test cases (`t`).

Given the provided state, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` or any other variables in the loop head since the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the number of iterations is already determined by `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
