### Reasoning:

The provided program contains a few logical errors that prevent it from correctly determining whether the array can be sorted using the described operations. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Splitting and Comparison**:
   - The program attempts to split the array elements when an element is found to be smaller than the previous one. However, it incorrectly assumes that simply splitting the previous element and checking if the resulting array (including the current element) is sorted is sufficient.
   - The program only considers the first digit of the previous element and the current element for comparison, which is not the correct approach. The operation allows splitting any element that is at least 10 into its digits, and we need to consider all possible splits to determine if the array can be sorted.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Digits**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where multiple digits need to be inserted. It only checks the immediate previous element and its first digit, which is insufficient to cover all possible transformations.

3. **Incorrect Loop and Condition**:
   - The loop iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, which is not the correct approach for determining if the array can be sorted. The correct approach would involve checking if the array can be transformed into a sorted state by considering all possible splits.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program is not correctly implementing the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
