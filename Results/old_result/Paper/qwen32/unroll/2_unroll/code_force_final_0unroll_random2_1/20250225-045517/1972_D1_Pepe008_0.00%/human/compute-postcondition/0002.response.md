To determine the output state, let's break down the loop and understand what it does:

1. **Initial State**: `T` is assigned the value of the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Execution**:
    - For each test case (from `0` to `T-1`), the loop reads two integers `a` and `b`.
    - It initializes `suma` to `0`.
    - It then iterates over `i` from `1` to `b`.
    - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
    - If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than `0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.
    - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

The loop modifies the variables `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, and `x` within each iteration. However, since the variables `T`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by the loop, they remain unchanged.

The output state is determined by the printed value in each iteration of the outer loop. Since the output is printed for each test case, the output state will be a sequence of printed values corresponding to each test case.

To describe the output state in a simple format, we can say that the output state consists of `T` lines, where each line contains the result of the computation for the respective test case.

Output State: **The output state consists of T lines, each containing the result of the computation `suma - 1` for each test case.**
