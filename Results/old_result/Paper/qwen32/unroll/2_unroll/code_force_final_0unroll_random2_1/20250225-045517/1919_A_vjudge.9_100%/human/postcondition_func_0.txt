The function reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then determines if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; if the difference is odd, it prints "Alice". This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.
