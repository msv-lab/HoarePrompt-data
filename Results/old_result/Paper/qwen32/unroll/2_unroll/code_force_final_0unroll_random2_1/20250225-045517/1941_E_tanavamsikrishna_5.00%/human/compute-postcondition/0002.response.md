Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the river grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers being 0; `costs` is a list where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding row in `rows` with the argument `d`.**

In simpler terms, after the code executes, the `costs` list is created, where each element is the result of processing each row in the `rows` list using the function `func_1` with `d` as the argument. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`) retain their initial values.
