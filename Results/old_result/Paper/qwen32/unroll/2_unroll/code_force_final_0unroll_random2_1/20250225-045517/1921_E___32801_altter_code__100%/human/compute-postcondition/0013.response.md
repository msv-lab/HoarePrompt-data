The value of `x1` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `r` is a list of integers; `n` is `r[0]`; `m` is `r[1]`; `x1` is `r[2] + 1`; `y1` is `r[3] + 1`; `x2` is `r[4]`; `y2` is `r[5]`; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `y2` is greater than `y1`.
