To determine the output state after the loop execution, let's analyze the code step by step.

The provided loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. Here's a breakdown of what the code does in each iteration:

1. **Reading Input**: It reads two integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Calculating `t`**:
   - It first sets `t` to the value of `b`.
   - If `t` is even, it divides `t` by 2. If `t` is odd, it divides `t` by 2 and adds 1 (essentially rounding up).
3. **Calculating `t1`**: It calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
4. **Adjusting `t`**:
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, it calculates `t2` as `a - t1`. It then adjusts `t` by adding the number of 15-unit increments needed to cover `t2`. If `t2` is not a multiple of 15, it adds an additional increment.

5. **Output**: The adjusted value of `t` is printed.

The loop does not modify the initial variables `x` and `y` (the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons). The only output from the loop is the value of `t` after each iteration, which is printed.

Since the code does not accumulate results across iterations or modify `x` and `y`, the output state will simply be the printed values of `t` for each of the `n` iterations.

Given the problem statement, the output state will be a series of printed values of `t` after each iteration. However, since we need to represent the final state in the specified format, we can summarize it as follows:

Output State: **The printed values of `t` for each of the `n` iterations.**

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` for each iteration are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical values of `t` for each iteration. However, we can describe the state as the series of outputs produced by the loop.

Thus, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **The printed values of `t` for each of the `n` iterations.**
