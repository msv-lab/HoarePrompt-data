Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 5), and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
