You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in the handling of constraints. Specifically, the condition `if bx >= ax:` is incorrect because it should be `if bx > ax:`. The current implementation will incorrectly return 0 whenever `bx` equals `ax`, even though there might be valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints in this case.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

- `bx` is the maximum of all constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).
- `ax` is the minimum of all constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
- If `bx > ax`, it means there are no integers that can satisfy both types of constraints simultaneously, so the answer should be 0.
- However, if `bx == ax`, it means there is exactly one integer `k` that satisfies both types of constraints, and it should be checked against the constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
3
1 5
2 5
3 6
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- k must be greater than or equal to 5.
- k must be less than or equal to 5.
- k must not be equal to 6.

The only integer that satisfies all constraints is 5. However, the current code will return 0 because `bx` (5) is equal to `ax` (5), and it does not correctly handle this case.

To fix the code, the condition `if bx >= ax:` should be changed to `if bx > ax:`, and an additional check should be added to handle the case when `bx == ax`.

Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        elif bx == ax:
            if bx in cx:
                r.append(0)
            else:
                r.append(1)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

This corrected code properly handles the case when `bx == ax` and ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
