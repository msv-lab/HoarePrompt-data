Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for excursions. The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, and the result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Code Analysis
The provided code calculates the expected value using the following formulas:
\[ p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \]
\[ \text{result} = \left( \frac{p}{q} \right) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Combinatorial Calculation**: \(\binom{n}{2}\) represents the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: `sum_f` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
3. **Probability and Expected Value**:
   - The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f}\) seems to account for the initial friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The term \(m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\) seems to account for the expected increase in friendship values due to repeated selections of the same pairs.

### Verification Against the Example
Let's verify the code with the provided example:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  3 1 2
  1 2 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  3
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - There are 3 children (1, 2, 3) and 1 pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1.
  - For the first excursion, the pair (1, 2) is chosen with probability \(\frac{1}{3}\) and the sum of friendship values is 1.
  - For the second excursion, the pair (1, 2) is chosen with probability \(\frac{1}{3}\) and the friendship value increases by 1, making the sum of friendship values 2.
  - The expected value is \(\frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2 = 1\).

However, the expected output given in the problem statement is `3`, which suggests a different interpretation or calculation method.

### Correctness of the Code
The provided code does not seem to correctly account for the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement. The expected value calculation involves the probability of selecting each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values over multiple excursions.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not accurately compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

Final: **False**
