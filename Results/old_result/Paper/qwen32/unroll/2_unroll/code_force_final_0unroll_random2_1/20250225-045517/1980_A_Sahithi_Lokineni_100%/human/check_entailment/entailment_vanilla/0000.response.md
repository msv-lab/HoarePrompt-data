Let's analyze the given Python program step by step based on the problem description.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It also reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Dictionary Initialization:**
   - A defaultdict `d` is initialized with a default value function `default_value`, but this function is not defined anywhere in the code. This is a potential issue because the defaultdict will not have a default value of 0 for keys that are not explicitly set.
   - The dictionary is then manually set to 0 for keys 'A' to 'G'. This is redundant because the defaultdict should handle this automatically if `default_value` were properly defined.

3. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and counts the occurrences of each difficulty level by incrementing the corresponding value in the dictionary `d`.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Number of New Problems:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of new problems needed.
   - It then iterates over each key in the dictionary `d`.
   - If the count of a particular difficulty level `d[val]` is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. This logic is incorrect because it should check if the count is less than `m` (not less than or equal to), and it should add the difference only if the count is less than `m`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The use of `defaultdict` without a proper `default_value` function can lead to unexpected behavior.
- The logic for calculating the minimum number of new problems is incorrect. The condition should be `if d[val] < m` instead of `if d[val] <= m`.
- The function `func_1` is defined but never used, which is unnecessary.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct. The logic for calculating the minimum number of new problems is flawed, and the use of `defaultdict` without a proper default value function can lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**
