The code snippet converts the list `permutation` into a space-separated string and assigns it to the variable `result`. The values of `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`permutation` is `[1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 0, 3, 6]`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 10; `result` is `'1 4 7 9 2 5 8 0 3 6'`**.
