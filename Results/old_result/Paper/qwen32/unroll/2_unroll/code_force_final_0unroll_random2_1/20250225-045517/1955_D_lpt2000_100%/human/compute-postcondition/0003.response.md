Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= k <= m <= n`, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers. List `a` contains `n` integers, and list `b` contains `m` integers, with each integer in the lists satisfying `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
