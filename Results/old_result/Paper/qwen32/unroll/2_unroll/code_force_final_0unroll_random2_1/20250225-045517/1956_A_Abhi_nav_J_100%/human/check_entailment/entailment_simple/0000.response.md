### Reasoning:
The provided program is supposed to simulate the game described in the problem statement and determine the number of winners for each given number of players `n_i`. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the game logic. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to simulate the game for a single `n_i` (denoted as `b` in the function) and a sequence `a`. 
   - The function's current logic is incorrect because it does not simulate the removal of players based on the positions specified in `a`. Instead, it simply returns `a - 1` if `a <= b`, otherwise it returns `b`. This is not how the game is played according to the problem description.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - According to the problem, in each round, players at the positions specified in the sequence `a` are removed from the lineup simultaneously. If a position in `a` is greater than the number of remaining players, it is skipped.
   - The function should repeatedly simulate this process until no players are removed in a round, then return the number of remaining players.

3. **Example**:
   - For `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`, the correct simulation should result in 2 winners (players A and B), as explained in the problem statement.
   - However, the function `func_1` would return `2` for `a = 3` and `b = 5` (since `a <= b`), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game and thus the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
