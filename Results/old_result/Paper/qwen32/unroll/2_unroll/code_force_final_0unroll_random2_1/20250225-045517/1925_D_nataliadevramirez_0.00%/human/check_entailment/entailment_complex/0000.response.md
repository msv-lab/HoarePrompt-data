### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `friendships`: A list of `m` triples `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`, where `a_i` and `b_i` are children who are friends and `f_i` is the initial friendship value of that pair.

2. **Objective:**
   - Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - This value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, and the result is `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - For each friend pair `(a_i, b_i)` with initial friendship value `f_i`, the expected sum of friendship values for `k` excursions can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = f_i \times \left(\frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}\right) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula comes from the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}\).

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as input.
  - It initializes `result` to 0.
  - For each friendship `(a, b, f)` in `friendships`, it adds `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to `result`.
  - Finally, it returns `result % MOD`.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of `friendships`.
  - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result.

#### Verification:
- The formula used in `func_1` correctly computes the expected sum of friendship values for each pair of friends over `k` excursions.
- The code handles multiple test cases by iterating `t` times and calling `func_1` for each test case.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution as per the problem description and the given examples.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
