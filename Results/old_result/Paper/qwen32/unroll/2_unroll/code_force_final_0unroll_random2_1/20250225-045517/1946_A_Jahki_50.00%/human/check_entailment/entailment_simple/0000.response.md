### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array by incrementing one of its elements by 1 in each operation. However, there are several issues with the provided code:

1. **Handling Large `n` Values:**
   - The program includes a condition `if num2 > 10000` which is not a valid approach for solving the problem. This condition breaks the loop and prints fixed values (1 and 16668) for `n > 10000`, which is not consistent with the problem requirements.
   - There is no logical basis for why this condition should be there, and it does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

2. **Calculating the Median:**
   - The program correctly identifies the median index `ma` based on whether `n` is even or odd.
   - It then enters a while loop to increment the element at the median index until the new median is greater than the original median.
   - However, the approach of repeatedly sorting the array `b` inside the loop is inefficient and unnecessary. Sorting the array once and then using a priority queue (min-heap and max-heap) or a two-pointer technique would be more efficient.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of operations required to increase the median.
   - However, due to the inefficient sorting within the loop, the program will not perform well for large values of `n`.

Given these points, the program is not correct because it includes a non-logical condition that breaks the loop for `n > 10000` and prints fixed values, which is not aligned with the problem requirements. Additionally, the approach of repeatedly sorting the array is inefficient.

### Correctness: **False**
