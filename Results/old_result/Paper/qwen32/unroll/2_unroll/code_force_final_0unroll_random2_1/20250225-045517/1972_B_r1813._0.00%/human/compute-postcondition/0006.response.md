The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` in the `range(t)`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The state of `data`, `index`, `t`, and `results` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, but they are part of the given state before the loop starts. Since the loop head only depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a component of the original input string split by whitespace; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the string at `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
