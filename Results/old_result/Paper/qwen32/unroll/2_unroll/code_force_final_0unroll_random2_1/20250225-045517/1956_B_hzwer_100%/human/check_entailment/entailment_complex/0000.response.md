Reasoning:  
The provided program is not correct based on the problem description. The program calculates the number of duplicate integers in the list of cards you have, which is not the goal of the problem. Instead, the problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally.

The program should simulate the game, taking into account the optimal moves of both players. Here's a corrected approach:

1. Count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
2. Count the occurrences of each card in Nene's hand (which we can infer from the total occurrences of each card and your hand).
3. Simulate the game by alternating turns between you and Nene.
4. On each turn, choose a card optimally:
   - For you, choose a card that maximizes your points.
   - For Nene, choose a card that maximizes her points while minimizing your points.
5. Keep track of the points you earn and the cards on the table.

The provided program only counts the number of duplicate cards in your hand and sums them up, which is not the correct strategy to determine the maximum points you can earn.

Correctness: **False**
