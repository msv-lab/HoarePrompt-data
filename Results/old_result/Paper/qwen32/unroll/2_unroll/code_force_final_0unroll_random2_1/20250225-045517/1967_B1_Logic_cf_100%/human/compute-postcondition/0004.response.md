Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`, and for each test case, it computes and prints a value `ans` based on these integers. The value `ans` is calculated by starting with `n` and adding to it the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. The function handles up to `t` test cases, where `t` is provided as input.**
