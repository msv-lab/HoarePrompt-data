Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list of integers; `n` is `r[0]`; `m` is `r[1]`; `x1` is `r[2] + y2` if `y1` is greater than `y2`, otherwise `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + m - y2`; `y1` is `r[3] + 1` if `y2` is greater than `r[3] + 1`, otherwise `y1` is `r[3] - 1`; `x2` is `x2 - a`; `y2` is `r[5]`; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state; either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even; `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1`. If `y1` is less than `y2`, `a` is `m - y2`. `b` is `x2 - x1`, which is an even positive integer.**

However, there is an inconsistency in the postcondition because the if condition `(x2 <= x1 or x1 < 1 or x2 > n)` directly contradicts the precondition that `x2` is greater than `x1`. To resolve this, we need to clarify that the postcondition should reflect the state where the if condition is true, meaning one of the conditions `x2 <= x1`, `x1 < 1`, or `x2 > n` holds true. Here is the corrected postcondition:

Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list of integers; `n` is `r[0]`; `m` is `r[1]`; `x1` is `r[2] + y2` if `y1` is greater than `y2`, otherwise `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + m - y2`; `y1` is `r[3] + 1` if `y2` is greater than `r[3] + 1`, otherwise `y1` is `r[3] - 1`; `x2` is `x2 - a`; `y2` is `r[5]`; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state; either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`; `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1`. If `y1` is less than `y2`, `a` is `m - y2`. `b` is `x2 - x1`, which is an even positive integer if `x2 > x1`.**

This postcondition correctly reflects the state of the program variables after entering the if condition, taking into account the given precondition and the if condition.
