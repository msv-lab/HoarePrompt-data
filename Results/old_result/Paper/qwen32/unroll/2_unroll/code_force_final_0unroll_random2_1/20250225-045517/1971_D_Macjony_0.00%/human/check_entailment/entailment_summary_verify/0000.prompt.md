You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` binary strings. For each binary string, it calculates the number of segments of consecutive identical characters and subtracts one if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1'. It then prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) a binary string can be divided into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads multiple test cases, each containing a binary string. It then counts the number of times a transition from '0' to '1' occurs and uses this to determine the number of pieces required.

Here's the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Logic Breakdown
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` is initialized to 1 because even if there are no transitions, the entire string is one piece.
   - `flag` is used to check if there is at least one '0' followed by a '1' transition.

2. **Transition Counting**:
   - The program iterates through the string and counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1'.
   - Each transition increases the `count` by 1.

3. **Adjusting Count**:
   - If there is at least one '0' to '1' transition (`flag` is set to True), the program decreases the `count` by 1.

### Potential Issues
- **Edge Cases**: Consider the following edge cases:
  - A string with all '0's or all '1's.
  - A string with alternating '0's and '1's.
  - A string with a single character.

- **Logic Flaw**: The logic of adjusting the count by subtracting 1 when there is a '0' to '1' transition is incorrect. The program should not adjust the count based on the presence of a '0' to '1' transition. Instead, the number of pieces is simply the number of transitions plus one.

### Test Cases
Let's test the program with some edge cases:
1. **All '0's**: "000000" should return 1.
2. **All '1's**: "111111" should return 1.
3. **Alternating '0's and '1's**: "010101" should return 6.
4. **Single character**: "0" should return 1.
5. **Single character**: "1" should return 1.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with these cases:
1. **"000000"**: The program should return 1. It does.
2. **"111111"**: The program should return 1. It does.
3. **"010101"**: The program should return 6. It returns 3 (incorrect).
4. **"0"**: The program should return 1. It does.
5. **"1"**: The program should return 1. It does.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case of alternating '0's and '1's correctly. For the string "010101", the program returns 3 instead of 6, which is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation
The program incorrectly adjusts the count based on the presence of a '0' to '1' transition. The number of pieces should simply be the number of transitions plus one, without any additional adjustments.
