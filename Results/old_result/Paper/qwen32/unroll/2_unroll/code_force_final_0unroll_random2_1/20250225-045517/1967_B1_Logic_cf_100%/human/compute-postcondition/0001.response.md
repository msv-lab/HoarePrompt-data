The only variable in the loop head is `T`, which iterates over the range of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variables `n` and `m` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The variables `n` and `m` can remain as they are since they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `m` are two positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6**
