You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input and Output:**
   - Input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we have the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
   - We are also given the friendship values for each pair of friends.
   - The output for each test case should be the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and then \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

2. **Logic:**
   - For each test case, we need to consider the probability of picking a pair of friends and how the friendship values change over the excursions.
   - The expected value calculation involves considering the probability of picking a specific pair and the increase in friendship values over time.
   - The expected value can be calculated based on the number of pairs, the number of excursions, and the initial friendship values.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Calculating Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends (`sum_f`).

3. **Calculating Total Number of Possible Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs of children (`cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`).

4. **Calculating Numerator (`p`) and Denominator (`q`):**
   - The program calculates `p` and `q` based on the formula:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot cn2^2
     \]
   - It then simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).

5. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9+7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then calculates the result as `p * q^{-1} % M` and prints it.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the logic and calculations in the program match the problem requirements.

- **Sum of Initial Friendship Values (`sum_f`):** Correctly calculated.
- **Total Number of Possible Pairs (`cn2`):** Correctly calculated.
- **Numerator (`p`) and Denominator (`q`):** The formula used seems to be incorrect based on the problem description. The expected value calculation involves more complex probability and combinatorial considerations that are not accurately represented by the given formula.
- **Simplification and Modular Inverse:** Correctly implemented given the formula, but the formula itself is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation based on the problem description. The formula used for `p` and `q` does not accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
