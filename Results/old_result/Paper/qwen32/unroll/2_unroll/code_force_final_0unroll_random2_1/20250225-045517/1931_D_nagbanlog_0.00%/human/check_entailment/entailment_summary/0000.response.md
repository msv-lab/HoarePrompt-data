### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array for multiple test cases. A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders modulo \(x\) and \(y\) for each element in the array. For each number in the array, it calculates the required remainder modulo \(x\) that would make the sum condition true and checks if such a pair (required remainder modulo \(x\) and the actual remainder modulo \(y\)) exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

Let's break down the logic:
- For each number `num` in the array, it calculates `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
- It then calculates `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`, which is the remainder that `a_j` should have modulo `x` such that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
- The remainder modulo `y` remains the same for the difference condition, so `required_mod_y = mod_y`.
- If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it means there are elements with those remainders that can form a beautiful pair with the current element, so the count is incremented by the frequency of that pair.
- Finally, the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` is updated in the dictionary.

The program correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs as per the problem statement.
