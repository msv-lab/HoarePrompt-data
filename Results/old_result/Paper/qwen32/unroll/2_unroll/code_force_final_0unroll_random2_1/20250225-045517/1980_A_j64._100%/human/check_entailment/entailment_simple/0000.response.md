**Reasoning:**  
The program is designed to solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each of the difficulty levels 'A' through 'G' appears at least `m` times across `m` rounds. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:** The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 (representing the 7 difficulty levels from 'A' to 'G') to zero. It then iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems:** The function then calculates how many more problems of each difficulty level are needed to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems of each level. For each difficulty level `i` (from 0 to 6, representing 'A' to 'G'), if the count of that level is less than `m`, the function adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output:** Finally, the function returns `needed_problems`, which is the total number of additional problems required.

The logic correctly accounts for the requirement that each round must contain one problem of each difficulty level and calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to meet this requirement.

**Correctness:** **True**
