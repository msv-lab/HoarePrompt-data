To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the changes made by the loop to the variables. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
     - `n`: an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
     - `x` and `y`: integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
     - `a`: a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each test case in `test_cases`, the following steps are performed:
     - Extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` from the test case.
     - Initialize an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)`.
     - Initialize `beautiful_count` to 0.
     - For each number `num` in the list `a`:
       - Calculate `mod_x` as `num % x`.
       - Calculate `mod_y` as `num % y`.
       - Calculate `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
       - Calculate `required_mod_y` as `mod_y`.
       - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, add its frequency to `beautiful_count`.
       - Update the frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq`.
     - Append `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

3. **Output State**:
   - After processing all test cases, the `results` list will contain the count of "beautiful pairs" for each test case.
   - The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

Given the above steps, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, two integers x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is a list of integers representing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.**
