Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is that the program reverses the `a` and `b` lists before processing, which does not align with the logic needed to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue.

Here's a brief explanation of why the reversal is problematic:

1. **Reversing Lists**: By reversing the lists, the program starts processing from the end of the queue towards the front. However, Kirill's actions are based on his current position in the queue and the people in front of him, not behind him. The logic should be based on the original order of the queue.

2. **Logic for Swapping**: The logic for determining the minimum coins needed should involve considering the cost to swap with each person in front of Kirill, not behind him. The program's current approach does not correctly simulate this process.

To fix the program, we need to process the queue from the front to the back and keep track of the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position among the first `m` people. This typically involves using a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently keep track of the smallest costs for swaps.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Min-heap to keep track of the smallest a_i values
    min_heap = []
    heapq.heapify(min_heap)
    total_cost = 0
    result = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i < m - 1:
            # Add the cost to the heap
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, a[i])
            total_cost += b[i]
        else:
            # Consider the cost to move Kirill to position i+1
            current_cost = total_cost + a[i]
            result = min(result, current_cost)
            
            # Add the current a_i to the heap and update total_cost
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, a[i])
            total_cost += b[i]
            
            # Remove the smallest a_i from the heap and update total_cost
            smallest_a = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            total_cost -= b[i - (m - 1)]
    
    print(result)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

This corrected version processes the queue from the front to the back and uses a min-heap to efficiently keep track of the smallest costs for swaps, ensuring that Kirill can move to a position among the first `m` people with the minimum number of coins.
