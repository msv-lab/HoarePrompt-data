The code snippet `n, x = func_3()` indicates that the function `func_3()` returns two values, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `x`. Based on the initial state, we understand that `n` was initially a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `x` was a non-negative integer less than 2^30. After the function call, the values of `n` and `x` will be updated to whatever `func_3()` returns, while the array `a` remains unchanged unless `func_3()` modifies it, which is not indicated in the given information.

Since the specific values returned by `func_3()` are not provided, we can only state that `n` and `x` will take on whatever values `func_3()` returns, with `n` being a positive integer and `x` being a non-negative integer less than 2^30, consistent with the initial state's constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_3()`, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30 returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each element is less than 2^30.**
