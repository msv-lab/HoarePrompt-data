The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `t` is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each test case, the function receives an integer `n` representing the length of a list, where `n` is between 2 and 50 inclusive, and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies `0 <= a_i <= 99`.

The function processes each test case individually and returns a result for each one. The specific result for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that the function performs some computation or evaluation based on the values of `n` and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `a`.**
