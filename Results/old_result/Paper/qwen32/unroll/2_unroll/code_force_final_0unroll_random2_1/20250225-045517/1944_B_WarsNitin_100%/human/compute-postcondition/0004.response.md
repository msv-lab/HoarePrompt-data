Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then prints two lists, `ans1` and `ans2`, each containing `k` integers, such that each integer in these lists appears exactly once across both lists. The integers are selected based on specific conditions related to their occurrences and positions in the input list `a`.**
