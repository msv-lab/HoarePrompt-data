### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions, given the constraints and problem description. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
   - It then reads the details of each pair of friends, which includes the indices of the children and their initial friendship value.

2. **Computing the Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` of all pairs of friends is computed.

3. **Calculating Combinatorial Values:**
   - `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which represents the total number of possible pairs of children.

4. **Calculating Numerator `p` and Denominator `q`:**
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` is computed.
   - Both `p` and `q` are divided by their GCD to simplify the fraction.

6. **Computing the Result:**
   - The result is computed as `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`, where `pow(q, -1, M)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`.

### Verification of the Formula:

The formula used in the program seems to be derived from the expected value calculation of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions. However, the given formula does not match the expected formula based on the problem description. The correct formula should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and the expected increase in their friendship values over the excursions.

The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values is more complex and involves considering the probability of selecting a pair of friends and the expected increase in their friendship values. The provided formula does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.

### Conclusion:

Given that the formula used in the program does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation based on the problem description, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
