Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1. Each character in the string indicates the side of the street the corresponding house wants to live on (0 for the left side and 1 for the right side). The function returns the count of houses that want to live on the left side and the count of houses that want to live on the right side for each test case.**
