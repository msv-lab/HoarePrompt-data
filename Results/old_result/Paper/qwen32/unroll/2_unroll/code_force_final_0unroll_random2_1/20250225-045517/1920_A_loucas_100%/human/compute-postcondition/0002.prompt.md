Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is assigned the value of `t`; Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines where each line contains two integers a (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). Here, a = 1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a = 2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a = 3 means k must not be equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
