### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if the solution is correct.

**Problem Understanding:**

1. We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value.
2. The teacher randomly chooses `k` pairs of children for excursions.
3. If a chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
4. We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction `p/q`, and compute `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`.

**Approach:**

1. For each pair of friends, the expected contribution to the total sum is the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, where `f` is the initial friendship value.
2. The result for each test case is the sum of these contributions for all pairs of friends.

**Code Analysis:**

- **Function `func_1`:** This function calculates the accumulated value based on the number of excursions and the initial friendship values of given pairs of friends. It sums up the contributions of all pairs of friends and returns the result modulo `MOD`.
  
  ```python
  def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
      result = 0
      for i in range(m):
          (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
          result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
      return result % MOD
  ```

  - **Output Hints:** The function correctly calculates the accumulated value for each pair of friends and returns it modulo `MOD`.

- **Function `func_2`:** This function reads multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the result.
  
  ```python
  def func_2():
      t = int(input())
      for _ in range(t):
          (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
          friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
          result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
          print(result)
  ```

  - **Output Hints:** The function reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and prints the result. However, the hint about ensuring each child participates in at most one excursion is incorrect since the problem statement does not impose such a constraint.

**Correctness:**

- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends.
- The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

However, there is a subtle issue in the problem statement interpretation. The problem does not state that each child can participate in at most one excursion. Instead, it says that pairs are chosen randomly and independently, meaning the same pair can be chosen multiple times. The given solution correctly handles this by summing up the contributions of all pairs over `k` excursions.

**Final Conclusion:**

The solution correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs of friends, taking into account the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

**Correctness:** **True**
