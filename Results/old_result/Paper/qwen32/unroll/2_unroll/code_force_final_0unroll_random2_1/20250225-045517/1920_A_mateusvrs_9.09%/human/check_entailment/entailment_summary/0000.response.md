Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint individually. The constraints are of three types:
1. `k >= x` (type 1)
2. `k <= x` (type 2)
3. `k != x` (type 3)

The program keeps track of the maximum value `k` must be greater than or equal to (`bx`) and the minimum value `k` must be less than or equal to (`ax`). It also maintains a set of values `k` cannot be (`cx`).

### Key Points:
- `bx` is initialized to a very small value (`-1`), and it is updated to the maximum value of `x` for constraints of type 1.
- `ax` is initialized to a very large value (`1000000000 + 7`), and it is updated to the minimum value of `x` for constraints of type 2.
- `cx` is a set that stores all values of `x` for constraints of type 3.

### Logic:
- If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax` simultaneously, so the answer is 0.
- Otherwise, the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`.

### Implementation:
- The program uses a loop to iterate through each constraint and updates `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` accordingly.
- It then calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the number of excluded values (`cx` that fall within `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's look at the first test case from the example:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
- `bx` will be updated to 3 (from constraint `1 3`).
- `ax` will be updated to 10 (from constraint `2 10`).
- `cx` will contain `{1, 5}` (from constraints `3 1` and `3 5`).
- Since `bx (3) < ax (10)`, the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[3, 10]` that are not in `{1, 5}`.
- The valid integers are `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`, which is 7 in total.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. The logic and implementation match the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
