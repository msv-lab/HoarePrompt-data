### Reasoning:
The provided program follows the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`numCases`). For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`numInteger`) and then the list of integers (`numbers`).

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This is correct because sorting the numbers in non-decreasing order ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimums.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates the minimum of the two, adds it to the score (`suma`), and continues until the list is empty. This correctly implements the strategy of pairing the smallest numbers together.

4. **Output**: After processing each test case, the program prints the resulting score.

Given the function summary, the program correctly processes each test case by sorting the numbers and then pairing the smallest available integers together to maximize the score. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem.

Final: **True**
