Given the provided loop and initial state, let's analyze the loop and determine the output state:

The loop is:
```python
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. Since the loop only involves printing and does not modify any variables outside of its scope, the state of `data`, `index`, and `t` remains unchanged. The `results` list itself is not modified by this loop, but its contents are printed.

### Output State Analysis:
- `data`: Remains unchanged.
- `index`: Remains unchanged at `1 + 2*t`.
- `t`: Remains unchanged.
- `results`: Remains unchanged, but its elements are printed during the loop execution.

The output state is simply the state of the program after the loop has executed, which means the loop has printed each element in the `results` list.

### Output State:
Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `t` remains unchanged, and `results` remains unchanged with its elements printed.**
