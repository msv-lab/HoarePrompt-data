Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to sort the array using the described operation. The program attempts to check if the array can be sorted by splitting elements from the end towards the beginning, but it incorrectly assumes that splitting an element and checking if the resulting list (including the next element) is sorted is sufficient. This approach can miss cases where further splits are necessary to achieve a fully sorted array.

For example, consider the array `[12, 39, 4]`. The program would start from the end and see that `4` is less than `39`. It would then split `39` into `[3, 9, 4]` and check if this is sorted, which it is not. However, if we split `39` into `3` and `9`, and then further split `12` into `1` and `2`, we can get the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 9]`.

A correct approach would involve attempting to split elements and checking if the entire array can be sorted through a more comprehensive method, such as a backtracking approach or a more detailed simulation of the splitting process.
