The code snippet `li.sort()` sorts the list `li` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`) remain unchanged. Since `li` is now sorted, its elements are arranged from the smallest to the largest.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a sorted list containing n^2 integers, where each integer is calculated as a + k * c + d * h for k in range(0, n) and h in range(0, n).**
