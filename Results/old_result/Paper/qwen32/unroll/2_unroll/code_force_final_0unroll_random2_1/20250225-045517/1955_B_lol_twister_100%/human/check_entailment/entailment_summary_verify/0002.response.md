### Reasoning:

The problem involves constructing a progressive square matrix based on given parameters \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\), and then checking if a given list of integers can be rearranged to match the elements of this matrix.

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summary in detail:

1. **Finding the Minimum Value (`a`)**:
   - The code correctly identifies the minimum value in the list `l` as `a`. This is a reasonable assumption since the problem states that the elements of the progressive square are constructed starting from a value `a_{1,1}`.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The code generates a list `li` that represents the elements of the progressive square using the formula:
     \[
     a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h
     \]
     where \(k\) and \(h\) range from 0 to \(n-1\). This correctly reflects the rules for constructing the progressive square. The nested loops iterate over all possible positions in the \(n \times n\) matrix, generating the appropriate values based on the formula.

3. **Sorting and Comparing**:
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted. The code then checks if the sorted versions of `li` and `l` are equal. If they are, it means that the elements in `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. The code correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square based on the parameters \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\). It efficiently constructs the expected elements of the progressive square and checks if the input list matches these elements when both are sorted.

### Evaluation:

The code follows the problem description accurately and the function summary is consistent with the code's behavior. There are no apparent issues with the logic or implementation.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

**Final: True**
