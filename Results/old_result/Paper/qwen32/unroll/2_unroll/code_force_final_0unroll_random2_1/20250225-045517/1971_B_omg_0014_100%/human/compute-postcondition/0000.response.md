The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The value of `t` and the string `s` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is an input integer.**
