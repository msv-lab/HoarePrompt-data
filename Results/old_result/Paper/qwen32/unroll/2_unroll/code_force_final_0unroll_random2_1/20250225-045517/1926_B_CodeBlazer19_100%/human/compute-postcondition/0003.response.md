Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of the grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square composed of '1's with size `k` greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape ("triangle" or "square") found in the grid for each test case.**
