In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

The condition for the loop to execute is that `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `t` must be at least 2 (because there are at least two different types of constraints).

However, the problem states that `t` is the number of test cases and each test case has multiple constraints, but the loop itself only depends on `t`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Given the constraints and the need to adhere strictly to the loop head variables, the state should be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is the number of test cases and it is already mentioned that there are multiple test cases, we can assume `t` is already set to a value that satisfies this condition. 

State: **`t` is at least 1**
