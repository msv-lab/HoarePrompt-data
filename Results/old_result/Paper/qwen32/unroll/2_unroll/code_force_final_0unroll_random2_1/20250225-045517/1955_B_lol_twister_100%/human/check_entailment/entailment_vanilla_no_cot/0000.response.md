Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it assumes that the smallest element in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}` (the starting element of the progressive square). However, the problem does not specify that the smallest element is `a_{1,1}`; it only specifies that `a_{1,1}` is one of the integers chosen by Maxim, but it could be any integer, not necessarily the smallest one.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to try all possible values of `a_{1,1}` from the list `l` and check if the resulting progressive square matches the sorted list `l`. Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    for a in l:
        li = []
        for k in range(n):
            for h in range(n):
                li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        li.sort()
        if l == li:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This version of the function tries every element in `l` as the starting element `a_{1,1}` and checks if the resulting progressive square matches the sorted list `l`. If any configuration matches, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
