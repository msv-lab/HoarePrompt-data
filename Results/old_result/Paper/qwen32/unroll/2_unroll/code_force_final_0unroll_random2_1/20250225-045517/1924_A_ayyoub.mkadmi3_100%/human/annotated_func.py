#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. Additionally, t test cases are provided, with the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^6.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: s1 is the same as s, s2 contains characters from s that caused alphabet to reset, and alphabet is the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing a boolean, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`. The boolean is `True` if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, and `False` otherwise. The substring is the part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. `s2` is the set of characters from `s` that caused the alphabet to reset.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of a specific substring of `s` is at least `n * k`, that substring, and a string of characters that caused a reset condition.
