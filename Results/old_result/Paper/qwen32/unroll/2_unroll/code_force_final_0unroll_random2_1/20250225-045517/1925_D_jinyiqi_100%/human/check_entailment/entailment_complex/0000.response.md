### Reasoning:

The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen during k excursions. The expected value is to be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) and the result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

The provided program follows these steps for each test case:
1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of children \(n\), the number of pairs of friends \(m\), and the number of excursions \(k\).
2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: It calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
3. **Combinations Calculation**: It calculates \(\binom{n}{2}\) (the number of ways to choose 2 children out of \(n\)).
4. **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**:
   - The numerator \(p\) is calculated as \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\).
   - The denominator \(q\) is calculated as \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2\).
5. **Simplification**: The fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) is simplified by dividing both \(p\) and \(q\) by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
6. **Modular Inverse**: The modular inverse of the simplified denominator \(q\) modulo \(10^9+7\) is computed using Python's `pow` function.
7. **Result Calculation**: The result is calculated as \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\) and printed.

Let's analyze if the logic is correct:
- The numerator and denominator calculations seem to correctly account for the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
- The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result is within the required bounds.
- The gcd simplification ensures that the fraction is in its simplest form before computing the modular inverse.

However, there is a critical issue with the formula used for the numerator \(p\). The formula provided does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions. Specifically, the formula does not correctly account for the incremental increase in friendship values over the excursions.

The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair and then summing these expected values over all pairs. This involves more complex combinatorial and probabilistic calculations, which are not reflected in the provided formula.

Given the complexity of the problem and the need for a precise expected value calculation, the provided formula for \(p\) appears to be incorrect. Therefore, the program as written is not correct.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
