### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy to achieve this is to sort the list of integers in non-decreasing order and then pair the smallest available integers together. This ensures that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible given the constraints.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This ensures that the smallest integers are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Pairing and Summing**:
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It then repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest available elements), calculates their minimum, and adds this value to `suma`.
   - This process continues until all elements have been paired and removed from the list.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the `suma`, which is the maximum score for that test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy by sorting the list and pairing the smallest integers together. This ensures that the minimum of each pair is maximized, leading to the highest possible score. The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the optimal strategy, further confirming the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
