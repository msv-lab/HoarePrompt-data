### Reasoning:

The program is designed to convert a given integer `x` into a binary representation where no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Binary Conversion**: The program first converts the integer `x` into a binary string of length 30 (since `x < 2^30`).

2. **Transformation Rules**:
    - It iterates through the binary string and applies rules to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
    - If it encounters two consecutive `1`s, it converts the first `1` to `-1` and the second `1` to `0`.
    - If the last element is `1` and there is a carry-over flag (`flag`), it converts the last `1` to `0` and appends an additional `1` to the string.
    - If the last element is `0` and there is a carry-over flag, it converts the last `0` to `1`.

3. **Final Adjustments**:
    - The program ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by swapping `-1` and `1` if necessary.

4. **Output**:
    - The program outputs the length of the transformed array and the array itself.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Transformation**:
    - The transformation rules ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
    - The program correctly handles the carry-over scenario by appending an additional `1` if necessary.

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
    - The program handles the smallest possible value (`x = 1`) and the largest possible value (`x < 2^30`) correctly.
    - It also handles cases where the binary representation of `x` has multiple consecutive `1`s.

- **Output Format**:
    - The program outputs the length of the transformed array and the array itself in the required format.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program and its execution summary, it is clear that the program correctly transforms the binary representation of `x` according to the problem's constraints and outputs the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
