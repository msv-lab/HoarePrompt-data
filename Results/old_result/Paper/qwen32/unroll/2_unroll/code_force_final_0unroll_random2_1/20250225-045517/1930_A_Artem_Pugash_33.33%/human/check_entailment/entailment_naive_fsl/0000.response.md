Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score by always selecting the smallest possible pair of numbers from the list. Here's a breakdown of why the code works as expected:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of integers and the list of integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`). This ensures that the smallest numbers are considered first.
3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program then iteratively pairs the smallest numbers together, adds the smaller of the pair to the score, and removes both numbers from the list. This strategy ensures that the score is maximized because the smallest numbers are always being paired and added to the score.
4. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the total score.

The code handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as:
- When `n=1`, there is only one pair to consider.
- When all numbers are the same, the score will simply be `n` times the value of any number.
- When numbers are distinct, the smallest numbers are always paired together to maximize the score.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program correctly computes the maximum final score for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
