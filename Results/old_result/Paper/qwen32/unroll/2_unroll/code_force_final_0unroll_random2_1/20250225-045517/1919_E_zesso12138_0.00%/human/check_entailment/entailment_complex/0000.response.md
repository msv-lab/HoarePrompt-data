### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The main task is to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in a given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Calculates the number of ways to reach the final sum `p[-1] + n` after `n` steps.
- **Logic**: 
  - Initializes a `dp` array of size `2*n + 1` to store the number of ways to reach each possible sum.
  - Uses an offset `n` to map sums in the range `[-n, n]` to indices in the `dp` array.
  - Iterates through each element in `p` and updates the `dp` array based on the previous state.
  - Returns the value in `dp` corresponding to the final sum `p[-1] + n`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Handles input reading and output printing for multiple test cases.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads all input data at once and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and stores the result.
  - Prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is designed to count the number of ways to achieve the final prefix sum in `p` by considering all possible sequences of `1` and `-1` that could lead to the given sorted prefix sums.
- The use of an offset `n` ensures that all possible sums are mapped to valid indices in the `dp` array.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results modulo `998,244,353`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. It handles all the test cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
