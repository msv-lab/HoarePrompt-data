The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of participants and a number of screenshots showing different rankings of these participants. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to construct a consistent overall ranking of participants that aligns with all the given screenshots. It outputs 'yes' if such a consistent ranking exists and 'no' otherwise.
