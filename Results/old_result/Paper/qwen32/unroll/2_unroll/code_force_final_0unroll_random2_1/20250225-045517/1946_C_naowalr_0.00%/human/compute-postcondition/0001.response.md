The only variable in the loop head is `z`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations specified. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variables `n`, `k`, and `adj` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree where each sublist contains the vertices adjacent to the vertex corresponding to the index of the list; `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
