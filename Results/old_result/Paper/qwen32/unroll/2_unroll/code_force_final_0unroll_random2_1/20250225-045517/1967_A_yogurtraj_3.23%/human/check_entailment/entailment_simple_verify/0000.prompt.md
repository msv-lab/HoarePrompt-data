You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum score of subarrays that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] after buying up to k new cards. However, there are several issues with the logic that make the program incorrect.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Sorting the Cards**: The code sorts the list of card counts `a`. Sorting the list of card counts is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results because the order of card counts matters in calculating the number of valid subarrays.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `r` and `rem`**: The code calculates `r` and `rem` based on the difference in card counts, but it does not correctly account for the fact that all card counts should be equalized to maximize the number of valid subarrays.

3. **Incorrect Output Calculation**: The final output calculation `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` is incorrect. It does not correctly account for the number of valid subarrays that can be formed when the card counts are adjusted.

4. **Handling Remaining Coins**: The code does not correctly handle the remaining coins `k` after equalizing the card counts up to a certain point. It should continue to distribute the remaining coins to maximize the number of valid subarrays.

#### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5
1 1 1
```
- The goal is to maximize the number of subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of [1, 2, 3].
- With 5 additional cards, the optimal solution would be to distribute the cards to make the counts [2, 2, 2], which allows for 3 valid subarrays of [1, 2, 3] and their permutations.
- The provided code might incorrectly distribute the cards or calculate the number of valid subarrays, leading to an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is False.
