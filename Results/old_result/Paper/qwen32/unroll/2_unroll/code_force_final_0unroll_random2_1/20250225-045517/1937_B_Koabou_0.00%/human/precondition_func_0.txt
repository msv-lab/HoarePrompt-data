The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid. The next two lines each contain a binary string of length n, representing the binary values in the first and second row of the grid, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
