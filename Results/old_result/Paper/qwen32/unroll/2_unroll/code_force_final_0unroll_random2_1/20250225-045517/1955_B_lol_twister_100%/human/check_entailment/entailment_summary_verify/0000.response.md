Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine if a given list of integers can form a specific "progressive square" of size \( n \times n \) based on the rules provided:
- The top-left element \( a_{1,1} \) is chosen.
- The element at position \( (k+1, h+1) \) in the matrix is calculated as \( a_{1,1} + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \).

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Determines the minimum value in the list `l` and assumes it to be \( a_{1,1} \).
2. Constructs a list `li` containing the values \( a_{1,1} + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for all valid \( k \) and \( h \) (ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \)).
3. Sorts both `li` and `l`.
4. Compares the sorted lists. If they match, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Function Summary Recap
The function `func_1`:
- Takes parameters `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`.
- Assumes the minimum value in `l` as \( a_{1,1} \).
- Generates a list `li` based on the formula \( a_{1,1} + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \).
- Sorts both `li` and `l` and checks if they are equal.

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it assumes the minimum value in the list `l` is \( a_{1,1} \), which may not be true. The correct approach would require checking all possible values for \( a_{1,1} \).

### Reasoning
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly identify \( a_{1,1} \). The value of \( a_{1,1} \) is not necessarily the minimum value in the list `l`. To properly solve the problem, we need to check all possible values for \( a_{1,1} \) and see if the list `l` can be rearranged to match the progressive square generated by any of these values.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `n=3`, `c=2`, `d=3`, `l=[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]`
- Expected Output: `YES`
- Explanation: If \( a_{1,1} = 2 \), the progressive square is:
  ```
  2  5  8
  4  7 10
  6  9 12
  ```
  which matches the input list. However, the program assumes \( a_{1,1} = 4 \) (the minimum value) and generates:
  ```
  4  6  8
  6  8 10
  8 10 12
  ```
  which does not match the input list.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly identify \( a_{1,1} \) and therefore may produce incorrect results.

Final: **False**
