The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, stating that they are positive integers and that their current values are equal. However, this information is not relevant to the execution of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes `n` and `k` as positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and that `n` is equal to `k`.
2. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`, which directly outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the output of the code is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
