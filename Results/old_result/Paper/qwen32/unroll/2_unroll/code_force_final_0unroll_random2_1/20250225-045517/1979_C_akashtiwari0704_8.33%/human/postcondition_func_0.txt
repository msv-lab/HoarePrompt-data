The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `k` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a product of the integers in `k`, then replaces each integer in `k` with the product divided by that integer. If the sum of these new values is greater than or equal to the original product, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the modified list `k`.
