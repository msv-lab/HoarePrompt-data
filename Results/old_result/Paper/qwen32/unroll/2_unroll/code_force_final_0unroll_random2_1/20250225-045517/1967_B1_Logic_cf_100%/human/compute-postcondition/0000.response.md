Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are two positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function will be called multiple times with a total of `t` test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, representing the number of test cases. The initial conditions for `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.
