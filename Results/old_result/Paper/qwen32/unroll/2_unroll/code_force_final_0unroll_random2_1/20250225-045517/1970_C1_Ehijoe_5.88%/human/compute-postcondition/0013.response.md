The function `func_1` accepts parameters that describe a tree structure and a starting node for a round. Specifically, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the tree, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5`. It also receives an integer `t` which is always `1`, indicating that there is one round. The tree is defined by `n-1` edges, where each edge is a pair of integers `(u, v)` representing a connection between nodes, with `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. Additionally, the function receives `t` integers (in this case, just one integer `u_1`), representing the starting node for the round, with `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n`.

The function returns the result of some computation based on the tree structure and the starting node. Given the constraints and the fact that `t` is always `1`, the function will perform a specific operation starting from the node `u_1` and return the result of that operation.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always `1`, a list of `n-1` edges defining the tree, and a starting node `u_1`. The tree has exactly two leaves. The function returns the result of a computation starting from the node `u_1`.**
