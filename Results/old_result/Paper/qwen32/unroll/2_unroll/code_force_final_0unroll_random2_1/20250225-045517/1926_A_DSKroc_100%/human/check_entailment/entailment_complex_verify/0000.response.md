Reasoning: The original assessment is incorrect. The problem description does not specify a preference for which letter to output in the event of a tie (i.e., when both 'A' and 'B' appear with the same frequency). Therefore, it is acceptable for the program to consistently output either 'A' or 'B' when the counts are equal. The current implementation of the program outputs 'B' when the counts are equal, which is a valid and consistent approach. Hence, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
