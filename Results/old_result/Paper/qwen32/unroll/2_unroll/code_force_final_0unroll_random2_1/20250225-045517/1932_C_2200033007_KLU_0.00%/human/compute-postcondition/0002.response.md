Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list, and `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `r` is set to `n - 1`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
