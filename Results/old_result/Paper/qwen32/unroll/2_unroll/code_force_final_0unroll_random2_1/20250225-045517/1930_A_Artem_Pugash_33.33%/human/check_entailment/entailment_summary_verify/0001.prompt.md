You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of 2n integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum pairs formed by sorting the list and then pairing the smallest available integers together. The result for each test case is printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest possible pair of numbers at each step and adding the smaller number to the score. The optimal strategy is to sort the numbers in non-decreasing order and then pair them sequentially (first with second, third with fourth, and so on). This way, the smaller numbers are paired with the next smallest numbers, ensuring that the sum of the smaller numbers is maximized.

Let's break down the provided program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of integers and the list of integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`). This is correct because we want the smallest numbers to be paired together.
3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates the minimum of the two, adds it to the score, and continues until the list is empty. This correctly implements the strategy of pairing the smallest numbers together.
4. **Output**: After processing each test case, the program prints the resulting score.

The logic and implementation of the program align perfectly with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.
