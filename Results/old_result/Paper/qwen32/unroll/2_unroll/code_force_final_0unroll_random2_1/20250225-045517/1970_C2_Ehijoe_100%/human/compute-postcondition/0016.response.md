Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `nodes`, which is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` nodes, and `start`, an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, with the constraint that `1 <= start <= n`. The function returns a value that is not explicitly detailed in the provided output description, but it is implied to perform some operation related to the tree structure starting from the `start` node.**
