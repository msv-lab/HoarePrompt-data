The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `numero_testes`. The loop will execute if `numero_testes` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is intentionally unused, so we don't need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer representing the number of test cases read from the input and must be greater than 0**
