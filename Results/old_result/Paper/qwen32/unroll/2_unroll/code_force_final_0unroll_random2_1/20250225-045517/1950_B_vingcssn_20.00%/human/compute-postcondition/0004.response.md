Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 20. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 20. It then prints a pattern of `n` by `n` blocks separated by dots, with each block being 2x2 characters. If `n` is not within the range 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'.**
