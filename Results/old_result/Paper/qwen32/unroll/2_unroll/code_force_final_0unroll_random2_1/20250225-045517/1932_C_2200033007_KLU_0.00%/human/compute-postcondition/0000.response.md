Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list.**

In this output state, all the initial conditions for `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The new variable `b` has been initialized as an empty list.
