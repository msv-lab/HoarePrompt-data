The code snippet `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the value `start` within the deque `tree` and assigns it to the variable `idx`. The values of `tree`, `empty`, and `start` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`tree` is a deque containing all `n` nodes in a single path from one leaf to the other, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**
