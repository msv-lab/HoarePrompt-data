### Reasoning:

The provided program and the function `func_1` are not correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to determine the number of winners given a sequence `a` and an initial number of players `b`. However, the current implementation is incorrect. It only considers the first value of the sequence `a` (i.e., `int(k_wali_list[0])`) and checks if it is less than or equal to `b`. It then returns `a - 1` if true, or `b` if false. This does not simulate the process of removing players according to the sequence `a` in each round.

2. **Sequence Processing**:
   - The problem requires iterating through the sequence `a` and removing players at the positions specified in `a` in each round until no more players can be removed. The given code does not perform any such simulation.

3. **Multiple Values of `a`**:
   - The function `func_1` only considers the first value of the sequence `a` (i.e., `int(k_wali_list[0])`). It should consider the entire sequence `a` to correctly simulate the game.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the result for each `n_i` on the same line without a newline after each test case, which is not the expected format. It should print a newline after processing each test case.

5. **Lack of Loop for Sequence `a`**:
   - The program does not loop through the sequence `a` to simulate the rounds of the game. It simply calls `func_1` once for each `n_i`.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the solution, we need to simulate the process of removing players according to the sequence `a` in each round until no more players can be removed. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        kicked_out = set()
        for pos in a:
            if pos <= len(players):
                kicked_out.add(players[pos - 1])
        if not kicked_out:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in kicked_out]
    return len(players)

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = []
    for n_i in q_values:
        results.append(simulate_game(a, n_i))
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate as the given program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

**Final: False**
