You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 0

    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed by drawing diagonals between selected vertices of a regular polygon. The vertices of the polygon are numbered from 1 to \( n \) in a clockwise manner. Bessie has already chosen \( x \) vertices, and we are not allowed to choose any more vertices (\( y = 0 \)). We need to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using these \( x \) vertices.

### Key Observations

1. **Vertices and Gaps:**
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie divide the polygon into several segments (or gaps) where no additional vertices are chosen.
   - Each segment can potentially form triangles if it has more than 2 vertices.

2. **Counting Triangles:**
   - A segment of \( k \) consecutive vertices (including the endpoints) can form \( k - 2 \) triangles.
   - For example, a segment of 3 vertices can form 1 triangle, a segment of 4 vertices can form 2 triangles, and so on.

3. **Handling Segments:**
   - We need to consider both the segments between the chosen vertices and the segment from the last chosen vertex back to the first chosen vertex (to account for the circular nature of the polygon).

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Counting Gaps:**
   - The program only counts gaps of exactly 2 vertices (i.e., when `num == 1`), which means it only counts segments that can form exactly 1 triangle.
   - However, we need to count all segments that can form any number of triangles, not just those that can form exactly 1 triangle.

2. **Handling Circular Nature:**
   - The program correctly calculates the gap between the last chosen vertex and the first chosen vertex, but it only considers gaps of exactly 2 vertices.
   - It should consider all gaps and calculate the number of triangles they can form.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program adds `x - 2` to the count, which is incorrect. This value does not represent the number of triangles that can be formed by the segments.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:

1. Calculate the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
2. For each gap of \( k \) vertices, add \( k - 2 \) to the triangle count.
3. Handle the gap between the last chosen vertex and the first chosen vertex similarly.
4. Output the total number of triangles.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the maximum number of triangles that can be formed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
