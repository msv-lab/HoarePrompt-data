Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly account for the requirement that each round should contain one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. The current implementation only considers the difficulties 'A' to 'F' and does not ensure that each of these difficulties, as well as 'G', is available for each round.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            else:
                if hmp[i] < m:
                    ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the string `p` is set to `'ABCDEFG'` to include all difficulty levels. The rest of the logic remains the same, ensuring that each required difficulty level is available for each of the `m` rounds.
