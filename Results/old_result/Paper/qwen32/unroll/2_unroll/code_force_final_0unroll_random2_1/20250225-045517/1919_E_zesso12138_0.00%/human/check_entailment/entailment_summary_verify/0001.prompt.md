You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates and prints a hidden array `a` based on the given sorted prefix sums `p`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown
We need to determine how many possible arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` can produce a sorted prefix sum array `p` as given. The prefix sum array `p` is defined such that `p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Solution Explanation
The solution uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve the problem.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized as an array of size `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to `0`. This array is used to keep track of the number of ways to achieve a particular prefix sum.
   - `offset = n` is used to shift the indices of the `dp` array to handle negative prefix sums.
   - `dp[offset] = 1` indicates that there is one way to achieve a prefix sum of `0` (which is the initial state).

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a` (from `1` to `n`), the algorithm updates the `dp` array.
   - `new_dp` is created to store the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum after considering the current element of `a`.
   - For each possible prefix sum `j` (from `0` to `2 * n`), if there is a way to achieve this sum (`dp[j] > 0`), the algorithm updates `new_dp` for the sums that can be achieved by adding `1` or `-1` to `j`.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the counts do not overflow.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements of `a`, the final prefix sum (which is `p[-1]` in the sorted array) is used to determine the number of ways to achieve this sum.
   - The final sum is adjusted by adding `offset` to handle the shifted index.
   - The result is the value in `dp` at the adjusted final sum index.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Analysis
- **Initialization**: The `dp` array is correctly initialized to handle the initial state of the prefix sum being `0`.
- **DP Transition**: The transition logic correctly accounts for the two possible values of `a` (`1` and `-1`), updating the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum.
- **Final Calculation**: The final sum is correctly adjusted by adding `offset` to match the shifted index in the `dp` array.
- **Input Handling**: The input is correctly read and processed for each test case.

The solution correctly implements the logic to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Therefore, the solution is correct.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**
