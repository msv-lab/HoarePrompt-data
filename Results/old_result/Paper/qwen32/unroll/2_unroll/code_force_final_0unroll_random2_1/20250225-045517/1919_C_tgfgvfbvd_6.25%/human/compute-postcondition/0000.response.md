In the given task, the for loop is defined as follows:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a conventional name for a variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will execute based on the integer value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of times the loop will iterate.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer. The state before the loop starts should reflect that the input is already available and is a positive integer.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
3. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not used in the loop body.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

State: **The input is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**

Since the problem specifies that each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), we can refine our state to reflect this:

State: **The input is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of test cases.**
