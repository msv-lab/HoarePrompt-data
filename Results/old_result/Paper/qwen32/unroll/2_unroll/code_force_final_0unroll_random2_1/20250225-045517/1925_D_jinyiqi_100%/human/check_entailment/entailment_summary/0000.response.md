### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, and then outputting this value in the form of `p * q^(-1) % (10^9 + 7)`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.

Let's break down the program and its logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of children), `m` (number of friendships), and `k` (number of excursions).
   - For each friendship, it reads the indices of the two children and the friendship value.

2. **Calculating the Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program calculates the sum of all initial friendship values `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating Total Possible Pairs:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Computing the Numerator `p` and Denominator `q`:**
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction `p/q`:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q`.
   - It then divides both `p` and `q` by their GCD to simplify the fraction.

6. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The result is calculated as `p * q^(-1) % (10^9 + 7)`, where `q^(-1)` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Analysis:

The logic of the program appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the problem. Specifically:

- The formula used to compute `p` and `q` does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
- The expected value calculation involves the probability of selecting a pair of friends and the increase in their friendship value over time, which is not accurately captured by the given formula.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the formula used in the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
