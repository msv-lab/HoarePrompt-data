Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value input by the user, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the provided code snippet.
