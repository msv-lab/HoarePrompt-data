To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration and how it modifies the variables.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. In each iteration, the following steps occur:
1. Read an integer `bets` which represents the number of bets.
2. Read a list `a` of `bets` integers.
3. Compute the product `prod` of all integers in the list `a`.
4. For each integer in the list `a`, compute `a[i] = prod // a[i]` and accumulate the sum of these new values in `sumo`.
5. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, print `-1`.
6. Otherwise, print the modified list `a` with each element separated by a space.

After each iteration, the variables `bets`, `a`, `prod`, and `sumo` are reset and recalculated based on the new input for that iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is the loop counter.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by the loop body and remain the same throughout the execution of the loop.

Given this understanding, the output state will be determined by the outputs printed in each iteration of the loop. Since the outputs are printed and not stored in any variables that persist after the loop, the final output state will simply reflect the state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` after the loop completes, which is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 <= `k_i` <= 20.**
