The provided code snippet only defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, returning the result as a list. This lambda function is intended to be used for reading the indices `a, b, c, d` for querying the comparison results from the interactive environment.

Since the code does not perform any operations that modify the initial state or introduce new variables, and it does not execute any queries or calculations, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interactively query up to 3n times per test case by providing four indices a, b, c, and d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to receive a comparison result of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The function's goal is to determine a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The lambda function `I` is defined to read four indices from the input.**
