The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases. The other variables `n` and `a` are mentioned in the initial state but are not yet affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input value such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
