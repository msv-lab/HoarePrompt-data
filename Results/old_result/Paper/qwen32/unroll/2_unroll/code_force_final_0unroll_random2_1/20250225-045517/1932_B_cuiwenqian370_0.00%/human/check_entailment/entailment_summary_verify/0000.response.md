### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem at hand. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign starts occurring only after the previous one has occurred.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - This function appears to process a string `path` containing '@' and '*' characters. It calculates some value based on this string but does not relate to the periodicity of the signs or their sequential occurrence.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. The input format expected by `func_2` does not match the problem's input format. It expects the second line of each test case to be a string `path`, whereas the problem specifies a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` incorrectly describes the problem it solves. It states that the function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `path`, and processes them using `func_1`. This does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation provided in the original assessment accurately reads the input, calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence for each test case, and prints the results. It follows the problem description by iterating through each sign and finding the next occurrence year based on the previous sign's occurrence year.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem, and the function summary for `func_2` incorrectly describes its functionality.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
