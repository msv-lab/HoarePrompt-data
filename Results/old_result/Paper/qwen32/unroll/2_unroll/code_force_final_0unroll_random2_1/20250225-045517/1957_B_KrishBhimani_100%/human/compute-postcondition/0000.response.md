To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not need to be adjusted, and the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the problem statement, `t` is the number of test cases and is guaranteed to be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `t` is set correctly.

Since the loop depends on `t` (the number of test cases), we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value within the specified range before the loop starts. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the problem statement but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
