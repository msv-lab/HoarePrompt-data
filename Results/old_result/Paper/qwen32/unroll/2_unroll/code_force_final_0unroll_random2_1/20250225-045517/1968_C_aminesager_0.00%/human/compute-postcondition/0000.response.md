The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the input integer, and the constraints on `t` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
