Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap
Alice and Bob play a game where they take turns:
1. They can either swap wallets or keep their current wallets.
2. They must then remove one coin from their current wallet.
3. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **Even Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If the difference in the number of coins is even, both players can always mirror each other's moves.
   - This means that Bob, as the second player, can always force Alice into a losing position because he can always make the same move Alice made but with the wallets swapped.
   - Hence, Bob wins.

2. **Odd Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`)**:
   - If the difference in the number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always make a move that forces the second player (Bob) into a losing position.
   - Alice can ensure that she is the one to make the last move by maintaining an imbalance in the number of coins in her favor.
   - Hence, Alice wins.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
- It reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It checks the parity of `abs(a - b)`.
- If `abs(a - b)` is even, it prints "Bob".
- If `abs(a - b)` is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Function Summary Recap
The function summary accurately describes the program's behavior:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `a` and `b`.
- It determines the winner based on the parity of `abs(a - b)`.

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment correctly reasons that:
- An even difference in coins leads to Bob's win because he can mirror Alice's moves.
- An odd difference in coins leads to Alice's win because she can force Bob into a losing position.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
