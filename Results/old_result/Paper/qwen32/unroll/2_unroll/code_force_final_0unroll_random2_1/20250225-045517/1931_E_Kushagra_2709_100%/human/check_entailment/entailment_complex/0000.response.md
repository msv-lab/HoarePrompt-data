### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` and `zerocnts` accurately reflects the rules of the game and correctly predicts the winner.

#### Key Points:
1. **Game Rules Recap:**
   - **Anna's Turn:** Reverses the digits of any element in the list.
   - **Sasha's Turn:** Concatenates any two elements in the list and inserts the result back into the list.
   - **Game End:** When Sasha can't make a move (only one number left), Sasha wins if the number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Strategy and Logic:**
   - **Anna's Moves:** Reversing digits can potentially increase or decrease the number, but the primary impact is on the number of digits.
   - **Sasha's Moves:** Concatenation increases the number of digits, which can help Sasha reach \(10^m\).

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - **`zerocnts(num)`**: Counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. This is relevant because reversing a number with trailing zeros can reduce the number of digits, which may affect the total number of digits in the list.
   - **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**: 
     - **`tot`**: Sum of the number of digits of all integers in `nums`.
     - **`cntvals`**: List of trailing zero counts for each integer in `nums`, sorted in descending order.
     - **Adjusting `tot`**: For every even index in `cntvals`, `tot` is decremented by the value at that index. This adjustment accounts for the potential reduction in the number of digits due to Anna's optimal play (reversing numbers with trailing zeros).
     - **Decision**: Sasha wins if `tot` is at least \(m + 1\); otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Validation:**
   - The logic appears to correctly account for the potential reduction in the number of digits due to Anna's moves.
   - The decision criterion (`tot >= m + 1`) seems to align with the requirement that Sasha wins if the final number has at least \(m + 1\) digits.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the given rules and constraints. The reasoning and the implementation seem to match the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
