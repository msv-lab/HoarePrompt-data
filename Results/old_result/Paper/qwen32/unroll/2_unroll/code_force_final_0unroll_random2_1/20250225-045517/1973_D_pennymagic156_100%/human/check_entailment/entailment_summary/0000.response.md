Reasoning: Let's analyze the provided code and its behavior in the context of the problem description.

The main function `func_5()` is responsible for solving the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what it does:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function first reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_3()`. These represent the length of the hidden array and the number of subarrays required, respectively.

2. **Finding the Maximum Possible Value:**
   - It then iterates from `n` down to `1`, constructing queries of the form `? 1 {i * n}`. This means it is asking for the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. 
   - The function keeps track of the value of `v` which is updated to `i` when `f(1, n) = i * n` (i.e., when `v == n`).
   - This loop is intended to find the maximum possible value `v` such that `f(1, n) = v * n`.

3. **Checking for Valid Splits:**
   - After determining `v`, the function enters another loop that runs from `1` to `n // k + 1`. For each `i` in this range, it tries to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - It uses a while loop to make queries of the form `? {l} {i * v}` and updates `l` based on the response. If it successfully finds `k` such subarrays that meet the condition, it prints `! i * v` and exits.
   - If no such split is found after all iterations, it prints `! -1`.

Let's consider the correctness of these steps:

- **Finding Maximum Possible Value:** 
  - The loop from `n` down to `1` is designed to find the maximum possible value `v` such that `f(1, n) = v * n`. This is a reasonable approach because `f(1, n)` is the product of the length of the array and the maximum element in the array, and `v` is the maximum element in the array.
  
- **Checking for Valid Splits:**
  - The second loop attempts to find `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = i * v`. This is also a reasonable approach because it checks if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with the same value of `f(l, r)`.
  - The while loop inside the second loop makes queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` and updates `l` accordingly. This is a valid approach to check for the existence of such subarrays.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic in the second loop:

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:` checks if all `k` subarrays have been found and if the last subarray ends at `n`. However, this condition alone does not guarantee that the subarrays are of the form `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = i * v`. It only checks if there are `k` subarrays ending at `n` with the same `f(l, r)`.
  - The problem requires that the subarrays are contiguous and partition the entire array. The current logic does not ensure this.

Given this analysis, the provided code may not correctly handle all cases as it does not ensure that the subarrays are contiguous and partition the entire array.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**
