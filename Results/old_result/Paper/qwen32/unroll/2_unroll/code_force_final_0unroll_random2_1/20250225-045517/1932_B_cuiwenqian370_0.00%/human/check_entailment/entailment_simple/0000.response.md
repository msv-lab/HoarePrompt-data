Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, with each subsequent sign occurring after the previous one.

The annotated program, however, consists of two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`), which appear to be solving a completely different problem. `func_1` seems to be related to some path counting problem where the path consists of characters '@' and '*', and `func_2` reads input and applies `func_1` to it. This is entirely unrelated to the problem of determining the year of the n-th sign of the apocalypse.

To solve the given problem, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of signs and their periodicities.
3. Simulate the occurrence of each sign sequentially, starting from year 0, and keep track of the current year.
4. For each sign, find the next occurrence year that is greater than the current year and update the current year to this occurrence year.
5. Output the year of the n-th sign for each test case.

The provided program does not perform these steps and instead focuses on a different problem, which makes it incorrect for the given task.

Correctness: **False**
