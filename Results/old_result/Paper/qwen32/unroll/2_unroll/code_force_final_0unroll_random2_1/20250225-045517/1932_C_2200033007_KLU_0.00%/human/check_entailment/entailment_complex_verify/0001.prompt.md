You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes four parameters: an integer `n`, a positive integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the characters in `s` ('L' for left end, 'R' for right end). It then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It reads the array `a` of length `n`.
   - It reads the string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and output the remainders.
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements in the order they are removed.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - It iterates over the commands in the string `s`.
     - If the command is 'L', it appends `a[l]` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends `a[r]` to `b` and decrements `r`.

3. **Calculating the Product Remainders:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to calculate the product.
   - It iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order (since the elements were removed from the original array in the order they appear in `b`).
   - For each element `v` in `reversed(b)`, it multiplies `p` by `v` and appends `p` to `ans`.
   - It returns `reversed(ans)` to ensure the remainders are in the correct order.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Calculation of Product Remainders:**
  - The program does not take the remainder of the product at each step. It only calculates the product and then takes the remainder of the final product.
  - The correct approach is to take the remainder of the product at each step to avoid overflow and ensure the correct result.

### Correct Approach

To fix the program, we need to take the remainder of the product at each step:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            p = (p * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            p = (p * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the remainders of the product at each step. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
