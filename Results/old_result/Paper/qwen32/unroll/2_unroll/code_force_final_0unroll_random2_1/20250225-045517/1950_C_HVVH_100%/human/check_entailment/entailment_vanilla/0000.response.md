Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program first reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Conversion Logic**:
   - **If `h` (hour) is 0**:
     - It sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
     - This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - **If `h` (hour) is greater than 12**:
     - It subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
     - This is correct because any hour greater than 12 in 24-hour format corresponds to the same hour minus 12 in the PM part of the 12-hour format.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - It sets `day` to 'AM'.
     - **If `h` (hour) is 12**:
       - It sets `day` to 'PM'.
       - This is correct because 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using an f-string, ensuring that `h` and `m` are always two digits by using `:02d`.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the conversion logic with an example from the problem statement:

- **Input: 18:06**
  - `h` is 18, which is greater than 12.
  - `h` becomes `18 - 12 = 6`, and `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - The output is `06:06 PM`, which is correct.

- **Input: 00:59**
  - `h` is 0.
  - `h` becomes 12, and `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - The output is `12:59 AM`, which is correct.

- **Input: 12:00**
  - `h` is 12.
  - `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - The output is `12:00 PM`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and conversion rules specified in the problem statement. It correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and formats the output as required.

**Correctness: True**
