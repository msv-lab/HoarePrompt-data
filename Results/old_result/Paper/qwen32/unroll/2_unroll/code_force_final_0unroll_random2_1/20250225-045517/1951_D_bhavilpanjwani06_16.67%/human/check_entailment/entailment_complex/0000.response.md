### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by considering three main scenarios:

1. **When `n < k`:** In this case, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels because she does not have enough coins. The program correctly outputs "NO" in this scenario.

2. **When `n == k`:** In this case, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by purchasing one jewel at a price of `n` coins. The program correctly outputs "YES", followed by `1` (the number of stalls), and `n` (the price per jewel).

3. **When `n > k`:** Here, the program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. If true, it outputs "YES", along with `2` stalls priced at `n - k + 1` and `1`. The idea is that Alice will buy `1` jewel from the first stall and the remaining `k - 1` jewels from the second stall. However, this logic is flawed because it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases. Specifically, if `n` is very large compared to `k`, Alice might be able to buy more than `k` jewels by adjusting the prices of the stalls.

### Example of Flaw:

Consider the test case `n = 1000` and `k = 2`. According to the program's logic, it will output:

```
YES
2
999 1
```

However, Alice can buy 2 jewels from the first stall itself if the price per jewel is set to `500`, which contradicts the program's output. Therefore, the program does not cover all possible cases and can output incorrect results.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
