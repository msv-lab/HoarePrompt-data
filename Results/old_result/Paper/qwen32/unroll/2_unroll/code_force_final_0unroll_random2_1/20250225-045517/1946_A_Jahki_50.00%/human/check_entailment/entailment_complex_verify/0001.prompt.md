You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

    #State: - The loop may break early if `num2` is greater than 10000, in which case the output will be specific values (1 and 16668) and the loop will terminate early.
    #   - If the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, the output will be the number of operations (`op`) for each iteration.
    #   - The variables `t`, `n`, and the initial list `a` remain unchanged unless they are affected by the loop, which they are not in this case.
    #
    #Given the loop's behavior, the final output state depends on the values of `num2` and `case` provided during each iteration. Since the problem specifies that we need to describe the state in natural language and not the exact values, we can summarize the output state as follows:
    #
    #- If `num2` is ever greater than 10000 during any iteration, the loop breaks early, and the output will be `1` followed by `16668`.
    #- Otherwise, for each iteration, the output will be the number of operations (`op`) required to make the median of the list greater than its original value.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. If `n` is greater than 10000, it outputs `1` followed by `16668`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of operations needed to increase the median of the list `a` to a value greater than its original median and outputs this number of operations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array itself `case`.

2. **Handling Edge Case:**
   - The program checks if `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000. If it is, it prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop. This part of the code does not align with the problem requirements and seems to be an incorrect handling of large inputs. There is no indication in the problem statement that the program should behave differently for large input sizes.

3. **Parsing and Sorting:**
   - The program parses the input string `case` into a list of integers `a`.
   - It then sorts the list `a` into `b`.

4. **Calculating Median:**
   - The program calculates the index `ma` of the median element in the sorted list `b`. If `num2` is even, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1`, otherwise, it is set to `int(num2 / 2)`.
   - The median is set to `b[ma]`.

5. **Increasing the Median:**
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as the new median is less than or equal to the original median. Inside the loop, it increments the element at the median index `ma` by 1, increments the operation count `op` by 1, re-sorts the list `b`, and recalculates the new median.
   - The loop will stop once the new median is greater than the original median.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of operations `op` required to increase the median.

### Issues:
- The handling of the edge case where `num2 > 10000` is incorrect and does not align with the problem statement.
- The program sorts the list `b` in every iteration of the while loop, which is inefficient. Sorting a list of length `n` has a time complexity of O(n log n), and doing this in a loop can lead to a time complexity of O(n^2 log n), which is inefficient given the constraints.
- The program assumes that the median index `ma` is the same before and after incrementing the median element, which is not necessarily true. For example, if the median element is incremented to a value that is not the new median, the index `ma` might need to change.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
