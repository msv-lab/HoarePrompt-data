The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the split input.**
