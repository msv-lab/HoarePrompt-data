You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of changes required to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'F' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. Characters 'G' and any missing characters from 'A' to 'F' are not considered in the count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the difficulty level 'G' correctly. The problem description specifies that the difficulties of the problems can be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. However, the program only considers 'A' to 'F' and ignores 'G'. This means that if the required number of 'G' difficulty problems is not met, the program will not account for it, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
10 1
GGGGGGGGGG
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

Actual Output:
```
6
```

This test case seems to work because there are no 'A' to 'F' problems, and the program does not account for 'G'. However, consider another test case:

Input:
```
1
10 1
ABCDEFGF
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

In this case, the program does not recognize the presence of 'G' and incorrectly assumes that one more problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'F' is needed, resulting in an incorrect output of `1` instead of `0`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the missing handling of the 'G' difficulty level.
