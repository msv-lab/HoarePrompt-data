In the given task, we need to ensure that the `for` loop can execute based on the provided state. The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the variable `cases`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0, because `range(cases)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `cases-1`. If `cases` is 0, the loop will not execute.

2. **Adjustments Needed**: The state provided mentions that `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100. This means `cases` is already within a valid range that ensures the loop will execute. There is no need to change `cases` as it is already guaranteed to be greater than 0.

3. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` does not need to be initialized or adjusted before the loop starts, as it is automatically assigned by the `for` loop from the `range(cases)`.

4. **Other Variables**: The variable `info` is mentioned as an empty list, but it is not part of the loop head and therefore does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the above analysis, the state does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute. The provided state already ensures that the loop will run.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list**
