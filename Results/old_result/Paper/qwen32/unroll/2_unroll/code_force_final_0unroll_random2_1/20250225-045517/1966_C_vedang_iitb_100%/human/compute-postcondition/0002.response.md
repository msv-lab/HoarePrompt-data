Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand the purpose of the loop and how it modifies the state. The loop processes each test case individually, and for each test case, it determines the winner of a game based on the given rules.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - For each test case, the number of piles `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are read.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The maximum value in the list `a` is determined (`maxsize`).
   - The list `a` is sorted.
   - The smallest non-negative integer not present in the sorted list `a` (the MEX, Minimum EXcluded value) is determined (`mexsize`).
   - If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the winner is determined based on the parity of `mexsize`:
     - If `mexsize` is even, Alice wins.
     - If `mexsize` is odd, Bob wins.
   - If `mexsize` is not greater than `maxsize`, the winner is determined based on the parity of `mexsize`:
     - If `mexsize` is odd, Alice wins.
     - If `mexsize` is even, Bob wins.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the name of the winner (either "Alice" or "Bob") is printed.

After all test cases have been processed, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `sz` will not retain their values from the last test case because they are reinitialized at the start of each iteration of the loop. The only state that remains unchanged is `t`, which represents the number of test cases.

Thus, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); no other variables from the loop body are retained.**
