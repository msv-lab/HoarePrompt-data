`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition for `t` being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is still valid after the code has been executed. The values of the test cases and `x` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30.**
