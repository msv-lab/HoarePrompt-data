### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula used for `p` and `q` in the provided program does not accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's delve deeper into why this is the case.

#### Problem Understanding:
- **Pairs of Friends:** There are `m` pairs of friends with initial friendship values `f_i`.
- **Total Possible Pairs:** The total number of possible pairs of children is `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- **Random Selection:** For each of the `k` excursions, a pair is chosen randomly and independently.
- **Expected Value Calculation:** The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs involves considering the probability of selecting each pair and the increase in friendship values over time.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Input Reading and Sum Calculation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
   - It also correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f`.

2. **Total Number of Possible Pairs:**
   - The calculation of `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` is correct.

3. **Numerator (`p`) and Denominator (`q`):**
   - The formula used for `p` and `q` is incorrect. The formula:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot cn2^2
     \]
     does not accurately represent the expected value calculation. The expected value involves more complex combinatorial and probabilistic considerations.

4. **Simplification and Modular Inverse:**
   - The simplification of the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`) is correct.
   - The calculation of the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9+7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)` is also correct.

#### Correct Expected Value Calculation:
To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider:
- The probability of selecting a pair of friends in any given excursion.
- The expected increase in friendship values over the `k` excursions.

The correct expected value can be derived using the following approach:
- For each pair of friends with initial friendship value `f_i`, the expected increase in their friendship value over `k` excursions is `k * (k + 1) / 2`.
- The expected value for non-friend pairs is 0.
- The expected sum of friendship values is the sum of the expected values for all pairs of friends.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program's formula for `p` and `q` is incorrect, leading to an incorrect expected value calculation. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
