### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program in the context of the problem description.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it initializes:
     - `cx` as an empty set to store values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
     - `ax` to a large value (1000000000 + 7) to find the minimum value for constraints of type 2.
     - `bx` to -1 to find the maximum value for constraints of type 1.

2. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program reads `a` and `x`:
     - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x` (ensuring `k` must be at least `x`).
     - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x` (ensuring `k` must be at most `x`).
     - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` must not be `x`).

3. **Determining Valid Range**:
   - After processing all constraints for a test case, the program checks if `bx` (the minimum required value for `k`) is greater than or equal to `ax` (the maximum allowable value for `k`):
     - If `bx >= ax`, it means there are no valid values for `k` that satisfy both types 1 and 2 constraints, so the result for this test case is 0.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of integers in `cx` that lie within this range.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:

The logic implemented in the program correctly follows the problem's requirements:
- It correctly identifies the range `[bx, ax]` that satisfies the constraints of types 1 and 2.
- It correctly excludes the values in `cx` from the valid range.
- It handles edge cases, such as when no valid `k` exists (`bx >= ax`), by returning 0.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
