Functionality: **The function calculates the minimum total cost of placing `k` bridges in a grid such that the maximum distance between supports does not exceed `d`. It reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`). It also reads a 2D list `rows` representing the river grid. The function computes the minimum cost among all possible placements of `k` consecutive bridges in each row and prints this minimum cost.**
