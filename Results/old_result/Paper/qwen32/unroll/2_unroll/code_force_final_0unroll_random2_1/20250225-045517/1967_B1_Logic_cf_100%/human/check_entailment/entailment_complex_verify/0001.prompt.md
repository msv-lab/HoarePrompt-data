You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function will be called multiple times with a total of t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `ans` holds the final computed value for each test case, and it is printed after processing each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, and `b` are local to the loop and do not persist after the loop's execution for each test case. The variable `T` is the loop index for iterating through the test cases and does not persist after the loop completes. The input variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`, and for each test case, it computes and prints a value `ans` based on these integers. The value `ans` is calculated by starting with `n` and adding to it the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. The function handles up to `t` test cases, where `t` is provided as input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Answer**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This implies that it assumes all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid, which is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(a + b = a + 1\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot a = a\), and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(a\) when \(a = 1\).

3. **Loop for \(b > 1\)**:
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\) and adds this to `ans`.

#### Correctness Evaluation
- The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). This formula is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- However, the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly account for the condition involving \(\gcd(a, b)\). It assumes \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) for all \(a\), which is incorrect. The \(\gcd(a, b)\) can be any divisor of \(b\), and the formula should be adjusted accordingly.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula used does not properly account for the \(\gcd(a, b)\) in the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
