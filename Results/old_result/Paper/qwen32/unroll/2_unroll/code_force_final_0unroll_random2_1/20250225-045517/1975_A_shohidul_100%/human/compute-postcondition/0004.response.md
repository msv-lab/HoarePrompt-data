Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing a prefix of elements such that the remaining list is non-decreasing and the first element of the original list is greater than or equal to all elements of the new list. It outputs 'YES' if either condition is met, otherwise 'NO'.**
