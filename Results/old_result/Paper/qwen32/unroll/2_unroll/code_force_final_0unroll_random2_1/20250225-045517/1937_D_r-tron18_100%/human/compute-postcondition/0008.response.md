Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s1`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function returns the maximum number of non-overlapping "arrow" pairs that can be formed, where an "arrow" pair is defined as "<>"**.
