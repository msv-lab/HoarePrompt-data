To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0 because `range(cases)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `cases - 1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `cases`**: This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, `cases` must be greater than 0.
2. **Variable `i`**: This variable is the loop counter and is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, we don't need to adjust `i` manually before the loop starts.

Given the description of the `info` list, it should contain `cases` number of lists, each with three sorted elements. However, the state of `info` does not directly affect whether the loop will execute; it affects what happens inside the loop. Since we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we don't need to make any changes to `info`.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `cases` is greater than 0.

State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of lists, each of which has three sorted elements, `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
