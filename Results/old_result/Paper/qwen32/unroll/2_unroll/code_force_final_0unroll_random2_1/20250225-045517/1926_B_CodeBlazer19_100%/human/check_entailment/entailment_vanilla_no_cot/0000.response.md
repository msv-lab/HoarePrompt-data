Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Detection of Triangle and Square**: The program incorrectly identifies the presence of a triangle by checking if any row has exactly one '1', and it identifies a square by checking if any row has more than one '1'. However, this logic does not account for the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square as described in the problem statement.

2. **Handling of Multiple Rows**: The program only checks the count of '1's in each row independently. It does not check if the '1's form a continuous block in the manner required for a square or a triangle. For example, a triangle requires the '1's to be centered and form a specific pattern of increasing or decreasing number of '1's in consecutive rows.

3. **Logic for Printing the Result**: The program uses a simple if-else condition to print the result based on the presence of a row with exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the overall pattern of '1's across multiple rows.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to implement logic that checks for the specific patterns of '1's that form a triangle or a square, as described in the problem statement.
