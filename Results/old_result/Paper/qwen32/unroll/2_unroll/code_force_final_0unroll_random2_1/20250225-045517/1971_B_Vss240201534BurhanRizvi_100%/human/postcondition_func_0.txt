The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. For each string, it determines if the string can be rearranged to form a different string and prints 'Yes' along with the rearranged string if possible. If the string cannot be rearranged to form a different string, it prints 'No'.
