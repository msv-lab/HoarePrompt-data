The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `casos`. The loop will execute if `casos` is greater than 0. The variable `c` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we do not need to adjust its state before the loop starts. The state of `t` and `n` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `casos` is at least 1 to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 20, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `casos` must be greater than 0**
