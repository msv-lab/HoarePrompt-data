Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the calculation of the expected value and the formula used in the code.

The code uses the formula:
\[ p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \]
\[ \text{result} = \left( \frac{p}{q} \right) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

However, this formula does not accurately represent the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement. The expected value should consider the probability of selecting each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values over multiple excursions.

Let's consider a simple example:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  3 1 2
  1 2 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  3
  ```
- **Explanation**: 
  - There are 3 children (1, 2, 3) and 1 pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1.
  - For the first excursion, the pair (1, 2) is chosen with probability \(\frac{1}{3}\) and the sum of friendship values is 1.
  - For the second excursion, the pair (1, 2) is chosen with probability \(\frac{1}{3}\) and the friendship value increases by 1, making the sum of friendship values 2.
  - The expected value is \(\frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2 = 1\).

The provided code does not account for the correct probability and the increasing friendship values over multiple excursions. Therefore, it does not produce the correct expected value for all test cases.
