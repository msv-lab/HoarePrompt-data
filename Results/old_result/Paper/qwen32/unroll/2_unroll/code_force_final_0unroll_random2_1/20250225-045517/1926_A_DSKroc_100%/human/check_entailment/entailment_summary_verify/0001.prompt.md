You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' in the string is greater than the count of 'B', otherwise it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining which character, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in a given string of length 5. Each test case contains a separate string of length 5, and there are multiple test cases (up to 32).

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each of the `t` test cases:
   - It initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. These counters will keep track of the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string, respectively.
   - It reads the string `s` for the current test case.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is 'A', it increments `ac`.
     - Otherwise, it increments `bc`.
   - After counting the characters, it compares `ac` and `bc`.
     - If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

### Correctness Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and each string of length 5.
2. **Counting Logic**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string.
3. **Comparison Logic**: The program correctly compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. However, there is a critical flaw in the comparison logic:
   - The program only considers the case where `ac > bc` and prints 'A' in this case.
   - For all other cases (i.e., `ac <= bc`), it prints 'B', even if `ac == bc`.
   - This means that if the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, the program will incorrectly output 'B' instead of 'A' (or vice versa).

### Conclusion
The program fails to handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. In such cases, it should output either 'A' or 'B' as per the problem statement, but it consistently outputs 'B'. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

### Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you could modify the comparison logic to handle the case where `ac == bc` appropriately, for example by choosing one of the characters arbitrarily or based on additional criteria if specified. However, based on the provided code, the correctness is indeed **False**.
