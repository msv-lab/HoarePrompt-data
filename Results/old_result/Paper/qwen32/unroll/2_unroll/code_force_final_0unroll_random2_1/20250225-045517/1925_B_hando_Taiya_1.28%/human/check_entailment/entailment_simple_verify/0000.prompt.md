You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x; `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest value between the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n and the largest x // i that is less than or equal to n)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly calculates the maximum balance for each test case as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Balance:**
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (`isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates the maximum balance `ans` with `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates the maximum balance `ans` with `x // i`.
   - The program then prints the maximum balance `ans` for each test case.

### Why the Program Works:
- The program correctly identifies all possible divisors of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`.
- For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions to determine if `i` or `x // i` can be the maximum balance:
  1. **Condition 1:** If `n` sub-problems can each have a difficulty of at least `i` (i.e., `n <= x // i`), then `i` can be a candidate for the maximum balance.
  2. **Condition 2:** If `n` sub-problems can each have a difficulty of at least `x // i` (i.e., `n <= i`), then `x // i` can be a candidate for the maximum balance.
- The program keeps track of the maximum value of `ans` that satisfies either of the above conditions.

### Verification Against Example Cases:
1. **First Test Case:**
   - `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Possible divisors: `1, 2, 5, 10`
   - Checking conditions:
     - For `i = 1`: `n <= 10` (True), `ans = 1`
     - For `i = 2`: `n <= 5` (True), `ans = 2`
     - For `i = 5`: `n <= 2` (False), `n <= 5` (True), `ans = 5`
     - For `i = 10`: `n <= 1` (False), `n <= 10` (True), `ans = 10`
   - The maximum balance is `2` (since `n = 3` sub-problems can have difficulties `4, 2, 4`).

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Possible divisors: `1, 5`
   - Checking conditions:
     - For `i = 1`: `n <= 5` (True), `ans = 1`
     - For `i = 5`: `n <= 1` (False), `n <= 5` (True), `ans = 1`
   - The maximum balance is `1` (since `n = 5` sub-problems can each have difficulty `1`).

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Possible divisors: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420`
   - Checking conditions:
     - For `i = 6`: `n <= 70` (True), `ans = 6`
   - The maximum balance is `6` (since `n = 69` sub-problems can have difficulties that sum up to `420` with `6` as the GCD).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the maximum balance for all test cases by considering all possible divisors and checking the necessary conditions. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
