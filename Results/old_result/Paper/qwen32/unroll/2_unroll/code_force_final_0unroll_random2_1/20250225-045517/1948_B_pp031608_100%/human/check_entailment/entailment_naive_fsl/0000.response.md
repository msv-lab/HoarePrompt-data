Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly handles all cases as per the problem description.

The program is supposed to determine if it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits and inserting them back into the array.

Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting**: The program only checks if the current element and the previous element can be sorted together after splitting the previous element. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple splits are required or when the splits need to be inserted into the array in a way that maintains the sorted order.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting**: The program attempts to split the previous element and check if the resulting list (including the current element) is sorted. If it is not sorted, it immediately returns "NO". However, this does not account for the possibility of further splits on other elements or the need to insert multiple digits from the split element into the array.

3. **Incorrect Update of Array**: After a split, the program only updates the first element of the split in the array, which is insufficient to maintain the correct order or to fully explore the possibilities of further splits.

### Potential Counterexample

Consider the following input:

```
1
4
12 39 3 4
```

The correct output should be "YES" because we can split `12` into `1` and `2`, and `39` into `3` and `9`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 9, 3, 4]`, which can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 9]`, a sorted array.

However, the provided program would likely return "NO" for this input because it does not correctly handle the multiple splits and the need to maintain the sorted order after each split.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
