### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if the provided list of integers can be rearranged to form a specific progressive square matrix based on the rules provided in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `c`, and `d`, which define the size of the matrix and the parameters for constructing the progressive square.
   - It also reads the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The function `func_1` identifies the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It then constructs a list `li` that contains the elements of the progressive square according to the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`. This formula is derived from the problem statement, where `k` and `h` are the row and column indices, respectively.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both the constructed list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program then checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`. If they match, it means that the elements in `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the function returns `'yes'`. Otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the result from `func_1`.

### Execution Summary Analysis:
The execution summary correctly describes the function's behavior. It states that `func_1` checks if the list `l` can be rearranged to match a specific sequence generated based on the minimum value in `l` and the values of `c` and `d`. This aligns with the logic of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It generates the progressive square based on the provided parameters and checks if the given list of integers can be rearranged to match this square. The program handles multiple test cases efficiently and provides the correct output for each case.

**Correctness: True**
