Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively; `M` is an empty list; the operation `w = math.sqrt(q)` results in a TypeError. Additionally, `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and includes the additional constraints from the if condition.
