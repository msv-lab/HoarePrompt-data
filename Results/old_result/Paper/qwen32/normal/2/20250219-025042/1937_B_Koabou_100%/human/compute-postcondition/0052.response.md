To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `s` is constructed from parts of two lists `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on an index `i`. Specifically, `s` is the concatenation of the substring of `a[0]` up to index `i + 1` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `i`.
- `x` is either `n - 1` or it could be set by a break condition within some loop or control structure (not explicitly detailed here).
- `y` remains unchanged (its value is not specified or modified in the given context).
- `t` is explicitly set to `1`.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(t)
```

From the initial state, we know that `t` is explicitly set to `1`. There are no operations or conditions affecting the value of `t` before this print statement.

### Conclusion:

The print statement will output the value of `t`, which is `1`.

Output: **1**
