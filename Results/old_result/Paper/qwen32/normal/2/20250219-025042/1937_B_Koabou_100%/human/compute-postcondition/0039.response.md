The value of `t` is updated to `x - i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is `i` if the loop breaks at iteration `i` due to `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, otherwise `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if never met, `t` is `x - i + 1`, and `y` must be less than `x`. Additionally, `a[1][i:x]` equals `s[i + 1:x + 1]`.**
