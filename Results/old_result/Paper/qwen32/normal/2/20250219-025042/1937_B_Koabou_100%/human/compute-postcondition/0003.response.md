The code appends an input value to the list `a`. Initially, `a` is an empty list, and `n` is an integer read from the input within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. After executing the code, `a` will contain one element, which is the input value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing one element, which is the input value.**
