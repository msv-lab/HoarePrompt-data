Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is `i`, `y` is either `i` or 0 based on the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'`, and `i` is incremented by 1 with the loop or statement being broken. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list, `x` remains 0, `y` remains 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
