Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is set to `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `x` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s` or `x`.**
