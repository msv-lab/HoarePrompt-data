Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
        y = i
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value; `s` is an empty list unless `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, in which case `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`; `x` is 0 unless `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, in which case `x` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `y` is `i` if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, otherwise `y` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is `i`, `y` is either `i` or 0 based on the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'`, and `i` is incremented by 1 with the loop or statement being broken. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list, `x` remains 0, `y` remains 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is set to `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `x` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s` or `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
