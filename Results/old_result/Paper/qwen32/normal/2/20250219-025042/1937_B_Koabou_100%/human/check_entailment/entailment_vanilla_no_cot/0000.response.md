Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the code:

1. The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle all scenarios where the grasshopper can choose between moving right or down to achieve the smallest string.

2. The calculation of the number of paths that yield the smallest string is incorrect. The current approach does not account for all possible paths that could result in the smallest string.

3. The program does not handle cases where the smallest string can be achieved by different sequences of moves. For example, it might not consider paths that switch rows at different points to achieve the same smallest string.

4. The variable `y` is set but not used effectively in the logic to determine the smallest string and the number of paths.

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach should be used to keep track of the smallest string and the number of ways to achieve it at each step. This would involve maintaining a table to store the smallest string and the count of paths leading to that string for each cell in the grid.
