To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value.
- Depending on certain conditions, `s`, `x`, and `y` are set, but these are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment.
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `i`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value, `i` is incremented by 1**.

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

So, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`, then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value, `i` is `i_end + 1`**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `i_end`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value, `i` is incremented by 1**.
