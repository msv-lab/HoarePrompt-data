Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction**: The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string by making decisions based on the values in the grid. However, the logic for constructing the path is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle scenarios where the optimal path involves switching rows multiple times or staying in the same row.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Paths**: The program attempts to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. However, the logic for counting these paths is also flawed. The program incorrectly assumes certain conditions for counting paths, which may not hold true for all inputs.

Let's consider a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
5
01010
10101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00000
16
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The lexicographically smallest string is `00000`, which can be achieved by alternating between the two rows.
- There are 16 different paths that yield this string.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
- The program will likely output a different string and an incorrect count because it does not correctly handle the alternating pattern required to achieve the smallest lexicographical string.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all cases correctly.
