The code updates the value of `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`; `low` must be strictly less than `high`.**
