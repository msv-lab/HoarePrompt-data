You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function calculates and returns the maximum possible profit from selling `n` buns, where the first `b` buns can be sold at a special price, and the remaining buns at a usual price.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly finds the maximum profit Bob can achieve by choosing an optimal value of \( k \).

#### Explanation of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit if Bob sells the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first \( k \) buns is calculated as \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \). This formula accounts for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
   - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is simply \( (n - k) \times a \).

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - The search range for \( k \) is between 0 and \( \min(n, b) \) because selling more than \( b \) buns at the modified price would not make sense (as the price would become negative).
   - The binary search iteratively narrows down the range by comparing the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) with the profit at the next point (`mid + 1`).
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it means the maximum profit lies to the right of `mid`, so the search continues in the higher half.
   - Otherwise, the search continues in the lower half.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.

#### Verification:

- The binary search approach ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently, even for large values of \( n \) and \( b \).
- The calculation of profit in `func_1` correctly reflects the problem's conditions.
- The program handles edge cases, such as when \( k = 0 \) (all buns sold at the usual price) and when \( k = \min(n, b) \) (all buns sold at the modified price).

Given these points, the program appears to be correctly implemented and should produce the expected results for all valid inputs.
