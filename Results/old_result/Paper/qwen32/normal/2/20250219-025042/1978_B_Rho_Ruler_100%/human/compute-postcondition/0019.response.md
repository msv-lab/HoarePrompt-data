Postcondition: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
