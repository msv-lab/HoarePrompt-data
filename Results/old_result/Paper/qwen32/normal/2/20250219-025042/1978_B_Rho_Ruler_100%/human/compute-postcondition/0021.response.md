The code reassigns the value of `mid` to `(low + high) // 2`. Since `mid` was already defined as `(low + high) // 2` in the initial state, reassigning it does not change its value. Therefore, no changes occur to the values of `mid`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, or `max_profit`. The condition that `low` must be strictly less than `high` remains valid.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`; `low` must be strictly less than `high`**.
