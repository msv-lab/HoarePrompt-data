Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is `min(n, b)`, `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_mid)`, `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. The current value of `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`.**

Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
