You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns. He can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) such that:
- The first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`.
- The remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(k, n, a, b)`: Computes the profit for a given `k`.
2. `func_2(n, a, b)`: Uses binary search to find the `k` that maximizes the profit.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`:
This function calculates the total profit for a specific `k`:
- The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
- The profit from the remaining `n-k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`:
This function performs a binary search to find the `k` that maximizes the profit:
- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
- It iteratively narrows down the range by comparing the profit at `mid` and `mid + 1`.
- It keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during the search.

### Correctness Verification:
To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that:
1. The profit calculation (`func_1`) is correct for all possible values of `k`.
2. The binary search (`func_2`) correctly identifies the `k` that maximizes the profit.

Let's consider the edge cases and typical scenarios:

1. **Edge Case: k = 0**
   - All buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - Profit = `n * a`.

2. **Edge Case: k = min(n, b)**
   - The first `min(n, b)` buns are sold at decreasing prices.
   - The remaining `n - min(n, b)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **General Case: 0 < k < min(n, b)**
   - The first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case: n = 4, a = 4, b = 5**
   - Expected Output: 17
   - Calculated Output: 17 (k = 1)

2. **Test Case: n = 5, a = 5, b = 9**
   - Expected Output: 35
   - Calculated Output: 35 (k = 5)

3. **Test Case: n = 10, a = 10, b = 5**
   - Expected Output: 100
   - Calculated Output: 100 (k = 0)

4. **Test Case: n = 5, a = 5, b = 11**
   - Expected Output: 45
   - Calculated Output: 45 (k = 5)

5. **Test Case: n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000**
   - Expected Output: 1000000000000000000
   - Calculated Output: 1000000000000000000 (k = 1000000000)

6. **Test Case: n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1**
   - Expected Output: 1000000000000000000
   - Calculated Output: 1000000000000000000 (k = 0)

7. **Test Case: n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000**
   - Expected Output: 500500
   - Calculated Output: 500500 (k = 1000)

All test cases match the expected outputs, indicating that the program works correctly for these scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to correctly compute the maximum profit for all tested cases. There are no apparent issues with the logic or edge cases handled by the program.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the profit for different values of `k` and uses binary search to efficiently find the `k` that maximizes the profit. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases, and the program produces the expected results for all of them.
