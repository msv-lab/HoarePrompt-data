Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`; `low` must be strictly less than `high`.**

Explanation: The value of `profit_next` is recalculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
