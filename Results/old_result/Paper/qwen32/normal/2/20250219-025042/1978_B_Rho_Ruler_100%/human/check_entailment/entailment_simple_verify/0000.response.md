### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the total profit for a given `k`.
- **Formula**: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`
  - **First Term**: `k * b` represents the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `b, b-1, ..., b-k+1` without the subtraction part.
  - **Second Term**: `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts the sum to account for the decreasing prices.
  - **Third Term**: `(n - k) * a` represents the profit from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: Find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
- **Approach**: Binary search between `0` and `min(n, b)`.
  - **Initialization**: `low = 0`, `high = min(n, b)`.
  - **Loop**: Continue while `low <= high`.
    - **Mid Calculation**: `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
    - **Profit Calculation**: `profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
    - **Update Maximum Profit**: `max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)`.
    - **Adjust Search Range**:
      - If `profit_next > profit_mid`, set `low = mid + 1`.
      - Otherwise, set `high = mid - 1`.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm the state of the program before and after key operations.
- They correctly describe the calculations and the logic used in both functions.

#### Test Cases:
- The original assessment tested several cases, including edge cases and typical scenarios.
- All test cases matched the expected outputs, indicating that the program handles these scenarios correctly.

### Evaluation:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The formula used in `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for any given `k`.
  - The arithmetic series sum formula is applied accurately.
  
- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the maximum profit efficiently.
  - The loop correctly narrows down the search range based on the comparison of profits at `mid` and `mid + 1`.
  - The maximum profit is updated correctly throughout the search.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `k = 0` and `k = min(n, b)` correctly.
  - It also handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` efficiently due to the binary search.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit for selling the buns under the given conditions. The binary search ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs. The annotations and test cases further support the correctness of the implementation.

**Final: True**
