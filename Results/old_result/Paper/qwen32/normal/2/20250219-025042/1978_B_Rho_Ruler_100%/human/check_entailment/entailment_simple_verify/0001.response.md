### Reasoning:

To ensure the correctness of the provided program, let's systematically analyze the logic and behavior of the functions `func_1` and `func_2` using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the total profit if Bob sells the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.
- **Formula**: 
  - Profit from the first \( k \) buns: \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \)
  - Profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns: \( (n - k) \times a \)
- **Annotation**: The annotation confirms that the function returns the correct expression for the total profit.

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: Determine the maximum profit by finding the optimal value of \( k \) using binary search.
- **Search Range**: \( k \) ranges from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \).
- **Binary Search Logic**:
  - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \min(n, b) \).
  - While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:
    - Calculate `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
    - Compute the profit at `mid` (`profit_mid`) and `mid + 1` (`profit_next`).
    - Update `max_profit` if `profit_mid` is greater than the current `max_profit`.
    - Adjust the search range based on the comparison of `profit_next` and `profit_mid`:
      - If `profit_next` is greater, set `low` to `mid + 1`.
      - Otherwise, set `high` to `mid - 1`.
- **Annotation**: The annotation confirms that the function correctly implements the binary search and updates `max_profit`.

#### Verification:
1. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The formula for the profit from the first \( k \) buns correctly accounts for the decreasing price.
   - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is correctly calculated as \( (n - k) \times a \).

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search efficiently narrows down the optimal \( k \) by comparing profits at `mid` and `mid + 1`.
   - The search range is correctly set to \( \min(n, b) \), ensuring that the prices do not become negative.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k = 0 \), all buns are sold at the usual price, resulting in a profit of \( n \times a \).
   - When \( k = \min(n, b) \), the first \( \min(n, b) \) buns are sold at the modified price, and the remaining buns (if any) are sold at the usual price.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The binary search runs in \( O(\log(\min(n, b))) \) time, which is efficient given the constraints \( 1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit by choosing the optimal value of \( k \). The annotations confirm the correctness of the calculations and the binary search logic.

Final: **True**
