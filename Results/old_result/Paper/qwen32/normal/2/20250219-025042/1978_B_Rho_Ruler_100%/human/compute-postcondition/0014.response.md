The code snippet assigns the result of the function call `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` to the variable `profit_mid`. The values of `mid`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and only `profit_mid` is updated.

Output State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`**.
