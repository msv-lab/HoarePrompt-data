To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `low <= high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged
- `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`
- `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`
- `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`
- If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `low` must still be less than or equal to `high` after the updates.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios based on the update rules:

1. If `profit_next > profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
2. If `profit_next <= profit_mid`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

In both cases, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that after these updates, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

### Scenario 1: `profit_next > profit_mid`
- `low` is updated to `mid + 1`
- For the loop to continue, `mid + 1 <= high` must be true.

### Scenario 2: `profit_next <= profit_mid`
- `high` is updated to `mid - 1`
- For the loop to continue, `low <= mid - 1` must be true.

Given that `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, we can infer that:
- `mid` is always between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

To ensure the loop continues, we need to make sure that after the update, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. The simplest way to guarantee this is to ensure that initially `low` is strictly less than `high`.

Thus, the state should be adjusted such that `low` is strictly less than `high` before the update.

State: **`mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`; `low` must be strictly less than `high`**
