The code snippet updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value and `i`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 0, and `i` is a divisor of `x` such that `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, the new value of `ans` will be the larger of 0 and `i`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x
- `ans` is 0
- `x` is divisible by `i`
- `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`

After executing the line `ans = max(ans, i)`, the value of `ans` will be `i` if `i` is greater than 0 (which it is, since `i` is a divisor of `x` and thus positive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is `i`, `x` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.**
