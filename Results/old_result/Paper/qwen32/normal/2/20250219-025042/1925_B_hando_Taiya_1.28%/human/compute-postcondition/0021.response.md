Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\). `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.**
