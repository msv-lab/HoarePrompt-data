Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `x` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is set to `i`. If `n` is greater than `x // i` and less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is set to `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
