Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**
