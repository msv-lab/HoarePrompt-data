The given code snippet updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and the initial value of `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before the line `ans = max(ans, x // i)`, we need to account for this increment in our description of the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.**
