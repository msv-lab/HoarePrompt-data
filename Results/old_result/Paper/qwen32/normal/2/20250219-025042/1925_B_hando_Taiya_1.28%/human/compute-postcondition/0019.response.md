The code snippet updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `i` has increased by 1 compared to its previous value. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `i`.**
