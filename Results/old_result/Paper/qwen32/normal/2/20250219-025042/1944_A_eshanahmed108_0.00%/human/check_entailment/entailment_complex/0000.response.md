### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to \( k \) bridges. 

Initially, all islands are connected, meaning Everule can visit all \( n \) islands. Dominater's goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit by destroying bridges. 

Let's analyze the logic in the provided code:

- If \( n - k \leq 1 \), it means that even after destroying \( k \) bridges, there is at most one island left that Everule can visit (which is island 1 itself). This is because if \( n - k \leq 1 \), then \( k \geq n - 1 \), implying that Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands.
  
- Otherwise (\( n - k > 1 \)), it means that there are still enough bridges left so that Everule can visit more than just island 1. In this scenario, Everule can still reach all \( n \) islands unless Dominater has destroyed all possible bridges connecting island 1 to the others, which would only happen if \( k \geq n - 1 \). Since \( n - k > 1 \) implies \( k < n - 1 \), there are still some bridges left, and Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.

Thus, the logic in the code correctly implements the above reasoning:
- If \( n - k \leq 1 \), print `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
- Otherwise, print `n` (Everule can visit all \( n \) islands).
