You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints `1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a set of islands where initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit starting from island 1. The goal is to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater optimally destroys up to `k` bridges.

### Key Points

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - There are `n` islands.
   - Initially, there are \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) bridges connecting every pair of islands.
   
2. **Dominater's Action**:
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges.
   - The objective is to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit starting from island 1.

3. **Everule's Reachability**:
   - If no bridges are destroyed (`k = 0`), Everule can visit all `n` islands.
   - If Dominater destroys enough bridges to isolate island 1, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - Otherwise, Everule can still visit some subset of islands depending on how many bridges are destroyed.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution uses the following logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

Let's break down this logic:

- **Case 1: `n - k <= 1`**
  - This condition implies that the number of bridges that can remain intact is less than or equal to the number of islands minus one.
  - If `n - k <= 1`, it means that either no bridges are left (if `n - k == 0`) or just enough bridges are left to connect island 1 to at most one other island (if `n - k == 1`). In both scenarios, Everule can only visit island 1.
  - Therefore, the output should be `1`.

- **Case 2: `n - k > 1`**
  - This condition implies that more than enough bridges remain intact to allow Everule to visit all `n` islands.
  - If `n - k > 1`, it means that even after destroying `k` bridges, there are still enough bridges left to ensure that island 1 is connected to all other islands, allowing Everule to visit all `n` islands.
  - Therefore, the output should be `n`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly handles both cases:
- When `n - k <= 1`, Everule can only visit island 1.
- When `n - k > 1`, Everule can visit all `n` islands.

Thus, the solution is correct.
