### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem requirements and the provided code to ensure correctness.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of a main loop that processes multiple test cases and a helper function `func_1` that determines whether a given password is strong according to the specified rules.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the length `n` of the password and the password itself are read.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - Both lists are sorted.
   - The function then checks:
     - If the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order (this check is redundant since the list is already sorted).
     - If the largest digit is less than or equal to any letter in the `letters` list.
   - The function constructs a new string `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - Finally, it checks if `sortedPassword` matches the original password. If it does, the password is considered strong (`return True`); otherwise, it is not (`return False`).

#### Issues in the Code:
- The function incorrectly assumes that checking if the largest digit is less than or equal to any letter in the `letters` list ensures that no digit comes after a letter. This is not sufficient because the digits and letters must be in separate blocks within the password.
- The function does not explicitly check that all digits come before any letters in the original password.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure:
- All digits come before any letters.
- Digits are in non-decreasing order.
- Letters are in non-decreasing order.

Here's how the function should work:
1. Traverse the password to find the first occurrence of a letter.
2. Ensure all characters before this letter (if any) are digits and are in non-decreasing order.
3. Ensure all characters from this point onward are letters and are in non-decreasing order.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(password):
    seen_letter = False
    prev_digit = None
    prev_letter = None
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if seen_letter:
                return False  # A digit appears after a letter
            if prev_digit is not None and char < prev_digit:
                return False  # Digits are not in non-decreasing order
            prev_digit = char
        else:
            seen_letter = True
            if prev_letter is not None and char < prev_letter:
                return False  # Letters are not in non-decreasing order
            prev_letter = char
            
    return True
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided code, the original implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness:** **False**
