The only variable in the loop head is `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters in the `password` string, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last evaluated character of the `password` string. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in the `password` string to evaluate. Therefore, `char` should be the next character in the `password`.

Since the exact characters in `password` are not specified, we can denote the next character as `char_next`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters (where n â‰¥ 1), `char` is the next character in the `password` string (`char_next`)**

Note: The states of `digits` and `letters` are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted here. They will be reassigned within the loop body based on the value of `char_next`.
