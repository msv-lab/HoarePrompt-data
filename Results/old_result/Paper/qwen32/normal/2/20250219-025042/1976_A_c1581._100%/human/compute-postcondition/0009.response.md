The code appends the character `char` to the list `digits`. Therefore, the list `digits` now contains one additional element, which is `char`. The values of `password` and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters (where n â‰¥ 1); `char` is the next character in the `password` string; `digits` contains its original elements plus `char` at the end.**
