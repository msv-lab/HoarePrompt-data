Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order and has at least one digit; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order; `i` is `i + 1`. If `i < len(letters)` and `digits[-1] > letters[i]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues execution.**
