To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(digits)):
```

The variables involved here are `i` and `len(digits)`. The loop will execute if `len(digits)` is greater than 0 because `range(len(digits))` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `len(digits) - 1`, and the loop will iterate over this sequence.

Given the initial state:
- `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`.
- `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order.
- `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order.

For the loop to execute, `digits` must contain at least one digit. Therefore, `len(digits)` must be greater than 0.

Since `i` is the loop variable and gets initialized automatically by the `range` function, we don't need to explicitly set its value before the loop starts.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `digits` contains at least one digit.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order.**
