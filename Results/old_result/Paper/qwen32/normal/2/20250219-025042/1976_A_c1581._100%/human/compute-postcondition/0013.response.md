The code appends the `char` to the `digits` list. Therefore, the `digits` list now includes the new character `char`. The `password` string and the `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters (where `n â‰¥ 1`), `char` is the next character in the `password` string following the previously processed `char`, `digits` is a list that now includes `char` as its last element.**
