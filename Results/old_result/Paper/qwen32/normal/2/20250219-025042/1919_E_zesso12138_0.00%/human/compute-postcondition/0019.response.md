The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. This means that `results` will now contain the original value of `result` followed by the new value of `result`.

Given the initial state, `results` already contains one element, which is the value of `result` (from `results` being initialized as `[result]`). After executing the code, `results` will have two elements: the original `result` and the new `result`.

Therefore, the updated state is that `results` now contains two elements, both of which are the value of `result`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
