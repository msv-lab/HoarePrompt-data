The code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the slice of `data` starting from `index` to `index + n` to integers. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace.
- `index` is `3 + n`.
- `t` is an integer value greater than 0.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `result`.
- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

After executing the code:
- `p` is reassigned to a new list of integers derived from slicing `data` from `index` to `index + n`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
