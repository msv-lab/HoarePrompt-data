To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of the function call `result = func_1(n, p)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that after this line of code executes, `result` will hold whatever value `func_1` returns.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `result`, which is assigned the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. All other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within `func_1`.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace, `index` is `2 + n`, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
