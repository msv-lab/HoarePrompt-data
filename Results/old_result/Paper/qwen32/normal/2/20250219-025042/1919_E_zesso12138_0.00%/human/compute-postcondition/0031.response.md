Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is incremented by 1.
   - This means `t` has been increased by 1 from its previous value. Let's denote its previous value as `t_old`. Therefore, `t = t_old + 1`.

2. `res` is the value of `results[t-1]`.
   - Since `t` was just incremented by 1, `t-1` would be the previous value of `t`, which is `t_old`. Thus, `res` is assigned the value of `results[t_old]`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(res)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `res` holds the value of `results[t-1]`, where `t-1` is the previous value of `t` before it was incremented.
- Therefore, `res` is the value stored in the `results` list at the index `t_old`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the print statement will output the value stored in the `results` list at the index that was `t` before it was incremented by 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the value of results[t-1] and t-1 is the previous value of t before it was incremented by 1)**
