To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is incremented by 1. This means that `t` has been increased by 1 from its previous value.
- `res` is assigned the value of `results[t]`. This implies that `res` now holds the value stored at the index `t` in the list `results`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

### Analysis:
- Since `t` has been incremented by 1, the value of `t` is now one more than it was previously.
- `res` is the value at the new index `t` in the list `results`.
- The `print(res)` statement will output the value of `res`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `res` is the value at index `t` in the list `results`, and `t` has been incremented by 1, the output will be the value at the new index `t` in the `results` list.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the value at index t in the results list after t has been incremented by 1)**
