The given code snippet updates the value of `n` based on the value at a specific index in the `data` list. The new value of `n` is derived from `data[index]`, where `index` is calculated as `3 + 2*n`. This means that the value of `n` will change, and consequently, the value of `index` will also change in future iterations or calculations.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` is now the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`.
- `p` remains a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, but since `n` has changed, the range and contents of `p` might also change in subsequent code.
- `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace.
- `index` is recalculated as `3 + 2*n` based on the new value of `n`.
- `t` remains an integer value greater than 0 and one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `results` remains a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`.
- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, but since `n` and potentially `p` have changed, `result` would also change if `func_1` is called again with these new values.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 and one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
