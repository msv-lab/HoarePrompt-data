Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` with at least one element greater than 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where `new_dp[2 * n - 1]` is `(new_dp[2 * n - 1] + dp[2 * n]) % MOD` if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, and all other elements remain unchanged; `i` is 2; `j` is `2 * n`.**
