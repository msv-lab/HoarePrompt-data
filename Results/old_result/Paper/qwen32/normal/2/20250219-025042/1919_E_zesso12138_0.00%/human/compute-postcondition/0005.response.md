The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. None of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`) are modified by this line.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where `|p_i| <= n` for each element `p_i` in `p`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
