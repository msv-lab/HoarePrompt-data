Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where each element reflects the cumulative updates from `new_dp` based on the loop logic; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where each element reflects the cumulative updates from `dp` based on the loop logic; `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated to be equal to `new_dp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
