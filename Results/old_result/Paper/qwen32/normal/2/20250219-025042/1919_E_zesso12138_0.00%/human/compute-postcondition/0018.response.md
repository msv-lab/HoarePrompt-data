The given code snippet reassigns the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1(n, p)`. This means the previous value of `result` is replaced with whatever `func_1(n, p)` returns. The values of `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged unless they are modified within `func_1`, which is not specified here.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `result` is updated to the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
