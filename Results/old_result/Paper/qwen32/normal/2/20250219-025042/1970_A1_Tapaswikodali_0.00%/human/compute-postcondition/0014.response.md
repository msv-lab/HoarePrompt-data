The code snippet appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the list `details`. Here's the updated state:

- `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `i` remains 1.
- `char` remains the second character of `s` and is either '(' or ')'.
- `balance` is increased by 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise `balance` is decreased by 1.
- `details` now includes the new tuple `(balance, -i, char)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `i` is 1; `char` is the second character of `s` and is either '(' or ')'; `balance` is increased by 1 if `char` is '(', otherwise `balance` is decreased by 1; `details` includes the new tuple `(balance, -1, char)`.**
