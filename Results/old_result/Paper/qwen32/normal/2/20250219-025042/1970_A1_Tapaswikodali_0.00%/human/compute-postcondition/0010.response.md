To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `char`. The loop iterates over the string `s` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index (`i`) and the character (`char`) at that index.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `i` is 0.
- `char` is the first character of `s` and is either '(' or ')'.
- If `char` is '(', then `balance` is 1; if `char` is ')', then `balance` is -1.
- `details` is a list containing one tuple: `[(balance, 0, char)]`.

For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 because `enumerate` will provide the next index and character in the string `s`. Therefore, `i` will be 1. The `char` will be the character at index 1 in the string `s`.

Since the loop head only includes `i` and `char`, we do not need to adjust any other variables like `balance` or `details` based on the information given.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `i` is 1; `char` is the second character of `s` and is either '(' or ')'**.
