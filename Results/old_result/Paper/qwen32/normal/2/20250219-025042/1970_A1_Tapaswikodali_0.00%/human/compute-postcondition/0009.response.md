The code appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the list `details`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s` (which is either '(' or ')'), and `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `char` is '(' or ')'.

- If `char` is '(', then `balance` is 1, and the tuple `(1, 0, '(')` is appended to `details`.
- If `char` is ')', then `balance` is -1, and the tuple `(-1, 0, ')')` is appended to `details`.

Since `i` starts at 0, `-i` is also 0 in both cases.

The other variables (`s`, `i`, `char`, `balance`) remain unchanged except for `details`, which now contains one element.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `i` is 0; `char` is the first character of `s` and is either '(' or ')'; if `char` is '(', then `balance` is 1; if `char` is ')', then `balance` is -1; `details` is a list containing one tuple: `[(balance, 0, char)]`.**
