The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` has one less element than before, and since the loop is continuing, `combined` must have had at least one element before the last iteration.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `combined` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to add back an element to `combined`.

State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped (which is still 0, so it remains empty); `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` has one element (since it needs to be non-empty for the loop to continue); `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is equal to `item`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit` before the assignment, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`.**
