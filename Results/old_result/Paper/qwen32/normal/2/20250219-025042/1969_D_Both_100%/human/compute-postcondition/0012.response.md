To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `k`. The loop will execute if and only if `k` is greater than 0. 

Given the initial state:
- `heap` is an empty list
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`
- `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`
- `max_profit` is 0
- `current_profit` is 0
- `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple (bonus)
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0

We need to adjust only the state of `k` to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple (bonus), `test_cases` must be greater than 0**
