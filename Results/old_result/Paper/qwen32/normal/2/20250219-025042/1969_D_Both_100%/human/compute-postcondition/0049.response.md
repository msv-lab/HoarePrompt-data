The code snippet `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` decreases the value of `current_profit` by the first element of `removed_item`.

Given that `removed_item` is equal to `item` and `item` is the last element that was in `combined`, the first element of `removed_item` is `item[0]`. Therefore, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[0]`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`heap` contains the `item`; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is an empty list; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is equal to `item`; `current_profit` is decreased by `item[0]`.**
