The code snippet combines the `neg_prices` list and the `bonuses` list into a single list of tuples using the `zip` function. This means each element in `combined` will be a tuple consisting of a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `combined`. It now holds the zipped list of tuples formed from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is `k_value`; `combined` is a list of tuples formed by zipping `neg_prices` and `bonuses`; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.**
