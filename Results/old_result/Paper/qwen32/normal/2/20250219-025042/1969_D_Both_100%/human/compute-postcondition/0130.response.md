Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the number of iterations (equal to the original length of `combined`); `combined` is empty; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop.`**

Natural Language Explanation: The `heap` variable is now an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values and states as described in the initial state.
