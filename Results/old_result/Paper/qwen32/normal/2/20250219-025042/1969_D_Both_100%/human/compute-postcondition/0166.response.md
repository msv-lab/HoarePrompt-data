The code snippet `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the first element of the `removed_item` tuple from `current_profit`. 

Given the initial state, `removed_item` is a tuple, and `removed_item[0]` refers to its first element. Since `removed_item` is truthy, `removed_item[0]` is also truthy and holds a specific value.

Thus, the value of `current_profit` is updated by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the `item` that was pushed in, and the smallest element from the original `heap` is now removed and stored in `removed_item`. `removed_item` is truthy (i.e., not None, False, 0, or an empty collection). `combined` has one less tuple than before. `n` is `n_value`. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0. `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`. `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
