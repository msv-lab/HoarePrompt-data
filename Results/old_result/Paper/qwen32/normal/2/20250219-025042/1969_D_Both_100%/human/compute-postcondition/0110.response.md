Output State: **`heap` contains the elements of the original `heap` with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `k` is 1; `item` is the last element of the new `combined` list; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases` remain unchanged; `combined` has one less element than it originally did; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` and is now `current_profit - removed_item[0] + item[0]` if `removed_item` is truthy; if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0] + item[0]` if `removed_item` was truthy, otherwise it's just `current_profit + item[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
