Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list; `k` is 1; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list and satisfies the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases` remain unchanged; `combined` has one less element than before.**
