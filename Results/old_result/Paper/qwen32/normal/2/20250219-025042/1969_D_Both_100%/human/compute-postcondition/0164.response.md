Output State: **`heap` contains the `item` that was pushed in, and the smallest element from the original `heap` is now removed and stored in `removed_item`; `combined` has one less tuple than before; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`; `current_profit` is calculated based on the conditions provided; `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `heap` now includes the `item` that was pushed into it, while the smallest element from the original `heap` has been removed and stored in `removed_item`. The `combined` list has lost one tuple compared to its previous state. All other variables (`n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases`, `item`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit`) retain their previous values or have been recalculated according to the given logic.
