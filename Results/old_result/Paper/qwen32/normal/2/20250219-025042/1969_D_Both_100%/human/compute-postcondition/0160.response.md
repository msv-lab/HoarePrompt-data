The code snippet `current_profit -= item[1]` subtracts the second element of the tuple `item` from `current_profit`. Given the initial state, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined` and satisfies the condition that the sum of its elements (`item[0] + item[1]`) is greater than or equal to 0. 

Since `current_profit` was initially set to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, or `0` otherwise, and now we are subtracting `item[1]` from it, the new value of `current_profit` is the previous value of `current_profit` minus `item[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is empty; `combined` has at least one tuple (one less than before); `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `-item[1]`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` and satisfies the condition that the sum of its elements (`item[0] + item[1]`) is greater than or equal to 0.**
