The given code snippet updates the value of `oneInd`. Here's the calculation:

`oneInd` is assigned the value of `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.

Other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified in the code snippet provided.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `oneInd`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is `'>'`, otherwise `2 * n`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**

In simpler terms, `oneInd` is now the sum of two function calls with specific arguments, while all other variables retain their initial values.
