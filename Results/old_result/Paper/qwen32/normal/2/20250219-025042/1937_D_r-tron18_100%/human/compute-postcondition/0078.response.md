To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to evaluate the expression for `zeroInd`:

```
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

Given:
- `suffZero` is `[0, 2]`
- `ol` is `totalOne` (which is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same)

Let's assume `ol` is a specific value for calculation purposes. For example, let's say `ol` is 3 (this is just an assumption for demonstration).

Then the expression becomes:
```
zeroInd = 2 * func_1([0, 2], 4) - func_1([0, 2], 1)
```

Without knowing the exact definition of `func_1`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `zeroInd`. However, we can express `zeroInd` in terms of `func_1`.

Assuming `func_1` is a function that takes a list and an index and returns some value, we can denote:
- `func_1([0, 2], 4)` as `A`
- `func_1([0, 2], 1)` as `B`

Thus,
```
zeroInd = 2 * A - B
```

Since we don't have the exact values of `A` and `B`, we can only express `zeroInd` in this form.

The other variables remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 2]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` is calculated based on conditions; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**

In simpler terms, `zeroInd` is now defined by the expression `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and all other variables retain their previous values.
