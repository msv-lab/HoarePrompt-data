To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Given:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is equal to '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `0`.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`, where `result_func_1` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

The code snippet:
```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

This line calculates the value of `oneInd` based on the last element of `preOne` and the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `oneInd`. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of `preOne` and the result of `func_1`.

Thus, the updated state includes the new value of `oneInd`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is equal to '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `0`, `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`, where `result_func_1` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
