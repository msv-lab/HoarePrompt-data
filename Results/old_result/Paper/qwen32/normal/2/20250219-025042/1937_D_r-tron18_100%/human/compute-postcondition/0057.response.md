Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same. `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'. `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise `[0, n, n+1]`. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided. If `zr <= ol`, `ans[0]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. If `zr > ol`, `ans[0]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. `n` must be greater than 0. `i` is `0`. `el` is the first character of `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne`. `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `2`. `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the conditions provided in the if and else parts.**
