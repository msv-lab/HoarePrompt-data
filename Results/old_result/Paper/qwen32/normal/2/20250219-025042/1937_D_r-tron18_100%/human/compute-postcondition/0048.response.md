Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>' and now the last element has been popped; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is calculated as follows: if `ol <= zr`, `ans[0]` is `2 * result_func_1 - (2 * preOne[-1] - result_func_1)`; if `ol > zr`, `ans[0]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `0`; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne` + 1; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1` if `ol <= zr`, `0` if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `2 * n` if `el` is not '>' and `ol > zr`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - result_func_1` if `ol <= zr`, `pre[0] - result` if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `(pre[0] + pre[1]) - result` if `el` is not '>' and `pre` has at least two elements and `ol > zr`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**

Explanation: The value of `totalOne` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
