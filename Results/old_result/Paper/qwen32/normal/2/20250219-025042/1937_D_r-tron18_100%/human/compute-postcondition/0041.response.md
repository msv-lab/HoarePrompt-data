Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `0`.
- `el` is the first character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'.
- `zeroInd` is not defined yet.

Code Snippet:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `zeroInd` is being assigned a value based on the last element of the list `suffZero`.

Calculation:
- If `el` is '>', `suffZero` is `[0]`, so `suffZero[-1]` is `0`. Therefore, `zeroInd` becomes `2 * 0 = 0`.
- If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, so `suffZero[-1]` is `n`. Therefore, `zeroInd` becomes `2 * n`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `0`; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', `2 * n` if `el` is not '>'**.

In simpler terms:
- If the first character `el` of `s1` is '>', `zeroInd` becomes `0`.
- If the first character `el` of `s1` is not '>', `zeroInd` becomes `2 * n`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
