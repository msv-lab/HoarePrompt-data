Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a complex approach involving prefix and suffix sums, but it does not correctly simulate the behavior of the pinball as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not accurately account for the inversion of the characters after each move, nor does it properly handle the movement logic for each pinball starting at different positions.

To correctly solve this problem, a more straightforward simulation approach would be needed, where for each starting position, you simulate the movement of the pinball according to the rules, keeping track of the number of seconds until it leaves the grid. This approach would involve iterating through each possible starting position and simulating the pinball's path while updating the grid as specified.

Given the complexity and the potential for errors in the current implementation, the program is deemed incorrect for solving the problem as described.
