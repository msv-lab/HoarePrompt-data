To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is equal to '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `0`.
- Additionally, `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.

Code Snippet:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

Here, `func_1` is a function that we do not have the definition for, but we know its arguments are `suffZero` and `ol`. Since `suffZero` is `[0]` and `ol` is `totalOne`, the exact value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` cannot be determined without knowing the function's implementation. However, we can denote the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` as `result_func_1`.

Thus, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * result_func_1`.

Since no other variables are modified in the given code snippet, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is equal to '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `0`, `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`, where `result_func_1` is the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`**.
