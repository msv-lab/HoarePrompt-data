To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and how it impacts the variables.

Given Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `0`.
- `el` is the first character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

This line calculates the value of `oneInd` using the formula `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `preOne[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `preOne`. Since `preOne` is a cumulative sum list starting from `0` and potentially excluding the last element if `el` is '>', `preOne[-1]` will be the sum of all elements in `pre` up to the point where the last element is excluded if `el` is '>'.
- `func_1(preOne, 1)` is a function call that takes `preOne` and `1` as arguments. Without knowing the definition of `func_1`, we can't simplify this further, but we can denote its result as `result_func_1`.

Thus, `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - result_func_1`.

Variables that remain unchanged:
- `s1`
- `pre`
- `totalOne`
- `preOne`
- `suffZero`
- `ans`
- `n`
- `i`
- `el`
- `ol`
- `zr`
- `zeroInd`

Updated Variable:
- `oneInd` is now `2 * preOne[-1] - result_func_1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `0`; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - result_func_1`.**
