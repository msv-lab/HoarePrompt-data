To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to understand the function `func_1` and how it interacts with the variables provided. However, since `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we will assume it performs some operation based on its inputs.

Given:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `0`.
- `el` is the first character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'.

The line of code to execute is:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

Since `func_1` is not defined, let's assume it returns some value based on its inputs. For the sake of this example, let's denote the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` as `result_func_1`.

Thus, `zeroInd` will be `2 * result_func_1`.

Let's update the state accordingly:

- `zeroInd` is now `2 * result_func_1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>', `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `0`, `el` is the first character of `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>', `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`**.
