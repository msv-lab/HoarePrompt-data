The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when its value is not used inside the loop), and it is controlled by the range function based on `t`. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4. Since the loop iterates `t` times, after each iteration, `t` effectively decreases by 1 until it reaches 0, at which point the loop terminates.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `t` is initially in the range 1 to 2·10^4, after the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `t` should be one more than its current value at the end of the previous iteration.

However, since we are asked to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, we simply acknowledge that `t` has already been decremented by 1 by the loop mechanism itself, so we do not need to manually adjust it further.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4 (after being decremented by 1 from the previous state), `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 0, `zero` is 3, `one` is 3, `lst` is [1, 3, 5], and `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is [0]**.

Since `t` is the only variable that could change due to the loop mechanics and it has already been decremented, no other variables need adjustment.
