Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4 (after being decremented by 1 from the previous state); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the user input string; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in `s`; `mini` is 100000000; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is []; `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50, or [0] if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the user input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50, or [0] if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `zero` is the count of '0's encountered so far, `one` is the count of '1's encountered so far, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`, and `one_perc` is the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is now `[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the user input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50, or [0] if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `zero` is the count of '0's encountered so far, `one` is the count of '1's encountered so far, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` ≥ 50 and `one_perc` ≥ 50`, `lst` is updated to include `i + 1`. `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged. `i` is still incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the user input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50, or [0] if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `zero` is the count of '0's encountered so far plus 1 if `s[i]` is '0'; otherwise, `one` is the count of '1's encountered so far plus 1, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`. If `zero_perc` ≥ 50 and `one_perc` ≥ 50`, `lst` includes `i + 1`. `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
