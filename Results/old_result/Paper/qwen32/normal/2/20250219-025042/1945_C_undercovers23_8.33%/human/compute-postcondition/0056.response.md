The code appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial conditions, `elem` is 2. Since `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is true (as `abs(3 - 2) == 1`), `final` was initially set to `[2]`. After appending `elem` again, `final` becomes `[2, 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is `n // 2` which is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` which is 3, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` which is 3, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `lst` is [2, 4], `mini` is 1, `elem` is 2, `final` is [2, 2]**.
