Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`:** The variable `pk` is calculated as `n // 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is correct, but the code unnecessarily checks if `n` is even or odd.

2. **Percentage Calculation:** The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated using `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. However, the problem requires checking if the counts of `0`s and `1`s are at least half of the respective sides, not percentages. Therefore, these calculations should be `math.ceil(zero / (i + 1))` and `math.ceil((o - one) / (n - i - 1))`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:** The program does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road could be placed before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`). The current logic for these cases is flawed and does not ensure that the conditions are met.

4. **Sorting and Selection:** The program sorts the list `final` to find the smallest `i` with the minimum distance to `pk`, but it should also check the edge cases properly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        pk = n // 2
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        
        # Check for placing the road before the first house
        if z >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            lst.append(0)
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and (o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        # Check for placing the road after the last house
        if o >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            lst.append(n)
        
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
        
        final = [elem for elem in lst if abs(pk - elem) == mini]
        final.sort()
        print(final[0])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions are checked correctly and handles the edge cases properly.
