To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4
- `n` is 7
- `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1'
- `s` is the input string "010101"
- `pk` is 3
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1']
- `o` is 3
- `z` is 3
- `lst` is []
- `mini` is 100000000
- `zero_perc` is 100

However, the variable `one` and `i` are not defined in the initial state. Since these variables are used in the calculation of `one_perc`, we need to make assumptions based on typical scenarios or default values.

Given that `s` is "010101" and `o` (number of '1's) is 3, we can assume `one` is 3 (since there are three '1's in the string). Similarly, `i` is often used as an index or counter in loops, and since `n` is 7, a common starting value for `i` would be 0.

Let's assume:
- `one` is 3
- `i` is 0

Now, substituting these values into the formula:
```python
one_perc = math.ceil((3 - 3) * 100 / (7 - 0 - 1))
one_perc = math.ceil(0 * 100 / 6)
one_perc = math.ceil(0)
one_perc = 0
```

Thus, `one_perc` is calculated to be 0.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `lst` is [], `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0**
