Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50. If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is [i + 1]. Otherwise, `lst` remains [].**
