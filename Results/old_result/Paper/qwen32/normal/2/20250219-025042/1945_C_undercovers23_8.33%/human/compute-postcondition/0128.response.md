The given code snippet appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was an empty list before this operation. After appending `elem` (which is 1) to `final`, `final` will now contain one element, which is 1.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4.
- `n` remains 7.
- `a` remains a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1'.
- `s` remains the input string "010101".
- `pk` remains 3.
- `sl` remains a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'].
- `o` remains 3.
- `z` remains 3.
- `mini` remains 0.
- `zero` remains 3.
- `one` remains 3.
- `lst` remains [1, 3, 5].
- `elem` remains 1.
- `final` is now [1].

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 0, `zero` is 3, `one` is 3, `lst` is [1, 3, 5], `elem` is 1, `final` is [1]**.
