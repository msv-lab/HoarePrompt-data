The code snippet `z = sl.count('0')` counts the number of '0's in the list `sl`. The value of `z` will be the count of '0's in the string `s` since `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`.**
