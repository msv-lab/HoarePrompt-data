Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, there are several issues:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages, but the problem requires checking if the counts meet the ceiling of half the number of residents on each side. The current implementation uses percentages and checks if they are greater than or equal to 50, which is incorrect.

2. **Logic for Counting Satisfying Conditions**: The program needs to check if the number of zeros on the left side is at least `ceil(i / 2)` and the number of ones on the right side is at least `ceil((n - i) / 2)`. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates these conditions using percentages.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house properly. It only considers placing the road between houses.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        pk = n // 2
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        
        # Check if placing the road before the first house works
        if o >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            lst.append(0)
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and (o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        # Check if placing the road after the last house works
        if z >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            lst.append(n)
        
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
        
        final = [elem for elem in lst if abs(pk - elem) == mini]
        final.sort()
        print(final[0])

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions specified in the problem statement are met correctly. It also handles the edge cases of placing the road before the first house and after the last house.
