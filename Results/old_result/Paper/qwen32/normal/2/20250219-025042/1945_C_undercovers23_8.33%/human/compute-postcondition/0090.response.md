To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4
- `n` is 7
- `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1'
- `s` is the input string "010101"
- `pk` is 3
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1']
- `o` is 3
- `z` is 3
- `lst` is []
- `mini` is 100000000
- If the current character `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. If the current character `s[i]` is '1', then `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
```

Since the code snippet uses `zero` and `i`, we need to know their values. However, these variables (`zero` and `i`) are not explicitly defined in the initial state. We can assume that `i` is the index in the loop iterating over the string `s`. Let's assume `i` is 0 for the first character '0' in the string `s`.

If `i` is 0 and `s[i]` is '0':
- `zero` is 1
- `one` is 0

Now, substituting these values into the code snippet:
```python
zero_perc = math.ceil(1 * 100 / (0 + 1)) = math.ceil(100) = 100
```

Thus, `zero_perc` is calculated to be 100.

Since the code snippet only calculates `zero_perc` and does not modify any other variables, the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `lst` is [], `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is 100.**
