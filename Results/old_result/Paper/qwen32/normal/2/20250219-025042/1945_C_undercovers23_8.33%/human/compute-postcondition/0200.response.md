The code sorts the list `final`. Therefore, the elements in `final` will be in ascending order after the sorting operation. The precondition that `final` is a list of all elements in `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini` remains valid, but now the list is sorted.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list of all elements in `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
