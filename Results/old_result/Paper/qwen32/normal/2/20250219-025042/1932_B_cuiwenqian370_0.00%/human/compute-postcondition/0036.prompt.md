You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a list or string consisting of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a list or string consisting of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: `path` is a list or string consisting of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `dp[0]` which is `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*'.
    #State: `path` is a list or string consisting of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'. `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0. If the first character of `path` is '@', `dp` is a list where the first element is 1 and the remaining elements are zeros. If the first character of `path` is '*', `dp` is a list where the first element is `-inf` and the remaining elements are zeros.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: `path` is a list or string consisting of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'. `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 1. If the first character of `path` is '@', `dp` is a list where the first element is 1. If the second character of `path` is '*', the second element of `dp` is `-inf`; otherwise, it is 2. If the first character of `path` is '*', `dp` is a list where the first element is `-inf`. If the second character of `path` is '*', the second element of `dp` is `-inf`; otherwise, it is `-inf`. The remaining elements of `dp` are zeros.
    #State: `path` is a list or string consisting of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'. `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains as initialized: the first element is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`, and the remaining elements are zeros. If `n` is greater than 1, the first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. The second element of `dp` is `-inf` if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise it is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@', or `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*'. The remaining elements of `dp` are zeros.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: dp array reflecting the maximum score possible up to each position in the path, with `-inf` at positions corresponding to '*' in the path.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum score possible from the dp array, excluding any positions that have a value of -inf.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list or string consisting of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*'. The function returns 0 if a certain condition is met (Case_1). Otherwise, it returns the maximum score possible from the `dp` array, excluding any positions that have a value of -inf (Case_2).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum score possible from the dp array, excluding any positions that have a value of -inf.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
