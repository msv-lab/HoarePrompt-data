Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` is a list or string consisting of characters, where each character can be either '@' or '*'. `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains as initialized: the first element is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`, and the remaining elements are zeros. If `n` is greater than 1, the first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. The second element of `dp` is `-inf` if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise it is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@', or `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*'. The remaining elements of `dp` are zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path` is a list or string consisting of characters '@' or '*'; `n` is the length of `path` and `n > 2`; `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise `-inf`; `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[1]` is '*', otherwise 2 if `path[0]` is '@', or `-inf` if `path[0]` is '*'. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is `max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + 1` for some `i > 1`. Remaining elements of `dp` are zeros except for `dp[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path` is a list or string consisting of characters '@' or '*'; `n` is the length of `path` and `n > 2`; `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise `-inf`; `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[1]` is '*', otherwise 2 if `path[0]` is '@', or `-inf` if `path[0]` is '*'; `dp[2]` is `-inf` if `path[2]` is '*', otherwise `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1`; `dp[3]` is `-inf` if `path[3]` is '*', otherwise `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1` if `path[3]` is '@'; remaining elements of `dp` are zeros except for `dp[i]`. `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path` is a list or string consisting of characters '@' or '*'; `n` is the length of `path` and `n > 2`; `dp[0]` is 1 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise `-inf`; `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[1]` is '*', otherwise 2 if `path[0]` is '@', or `-inf` if `path[0]` is '*'; `dp[2]` is `-inf` if `path[2]` is '*', otherwise `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1`; `dp[3]` is `-inf` if `path[3]` is '*', otherwise `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1` if `path[3]` is '@'; `dp[4]` is `-inf` if `path[4]` is '*', otherwise `max(dp[3], dp[2]) + 1`. Remaining elements of `dp` are zeros except for `dp[i]`. `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
