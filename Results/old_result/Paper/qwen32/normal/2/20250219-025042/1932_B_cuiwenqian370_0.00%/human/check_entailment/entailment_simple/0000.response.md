Reasoning:  
The provided annotated program does not solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the annotated program appears to be solving a different problem related to paths and scores, likely from a different problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be designed to calculate some kind of score based on a path of characters ('@' and '*'). It uses dynamic programming to compute this score, but it does not relate to the periodic occurrences of signs over time.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, it passes the entire string of periodicities (`path`) to `func_1` instead of parsing it into individual integers. Additionally, it expects `func_1` to return the correct year for the n-th sign, which it does not.

Given these discrepancies, the program is clearly not solving the intended problem.

Correctness: **False**
