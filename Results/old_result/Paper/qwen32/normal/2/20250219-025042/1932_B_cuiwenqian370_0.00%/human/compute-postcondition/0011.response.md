The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is an underscore and does not represent any specific variable being modified within the loop. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. Since `t` is the number of iterations the loop should perform, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented or adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decreased by 1.

Hereâ€™s how the state should look at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`path` is the string value of the third element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(path)`**
