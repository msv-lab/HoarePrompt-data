To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `path` is the string value of the third element in `data`.
- `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`.
- `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string.
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0.
- `index` is 3.
- `results` is an empty list.

Code Snippet:
```python
results.append(func_1(path))
```

Impact of the Code:
- The function `func_1` is called with `path` as its argument.
- The result of `func_1(path)` is appended to the `results` list.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended to `results`. However, we know that `results` will no longer be an empty list but will contain one element, which is the result of `func_1(path)`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`path` is the string value of the third element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(path)`.**
