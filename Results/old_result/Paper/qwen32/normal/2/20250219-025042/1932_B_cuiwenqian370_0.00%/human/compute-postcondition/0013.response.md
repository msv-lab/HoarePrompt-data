The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `index` was 3, so now it is 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is the string value of the third element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 4; `results` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(path)`**.
