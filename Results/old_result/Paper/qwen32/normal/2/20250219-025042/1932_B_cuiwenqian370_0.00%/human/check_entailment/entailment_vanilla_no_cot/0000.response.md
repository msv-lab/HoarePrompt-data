Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be related to a different problem involving paths and symbols ('@' and '*'), rather than calculating the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicity of each sign.

To solve the given problem, we need to simulate the occurrence of each sign sequentially, taking into account the periodicity of each sign. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(n, periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the current sign after the current_year
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur using the `find_apocalypse_year` function. It correctly handles the sequential occurrence of each sign based on their periodicities.
