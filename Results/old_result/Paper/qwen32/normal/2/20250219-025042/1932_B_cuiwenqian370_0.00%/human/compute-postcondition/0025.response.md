To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `path` is the string value of the element at position `2 * t + 1` in `data`.
- `n` is the integer value of the element at position `2 * t` in `data`.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `index` is `2 * t + 1`.
- `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is the result of `func_1(path)` for each respective `path`.

From the initial state, we see that there is a variable named `result` which is not explicitly defined in the given information. There is a list called `results` that contains `t` elements, but it does not specify a single `result`.

Given this, it seems there might be a typo or misunderstanding in the question because `result` is not defined anywhere in the initial state. If the intention was to print an element from the `results` list, it would need to specify which element of `results` to print.

However, if we assume that `result` is supposed to be one of the elements from the `results` list, and since no specific index is mentioned, we can only describe it generally.

Assuming `result` refers to any element in the `results` list, we can say:

Output: **result (where result is an element of the results list, specifically the result of func_1(path) for a particular path in data)**

If we need to be more precise and assume `result` is the last element added to `results` (which would be `func_1(path)` for the last `path` considered), then:

Output: **result (where result is the last element of the results list, specifically the result of func_1(path) for the path at index 2*t+1 in data)**

Without further clarification, the most precise general answer based on the given information is:

Output: **result (where result is an element of the results list, specifically the result of func_1(path) for a particular path in data)**
