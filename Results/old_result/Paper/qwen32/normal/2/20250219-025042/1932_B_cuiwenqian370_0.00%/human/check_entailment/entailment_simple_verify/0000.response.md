### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not match the problem description at all. Let's break down the issues systematically:

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign.
- Signs must occur sequentially, meaning the (i+1)-th sign can only occur after the i-th sign has occurred.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function seems to be designed to count the maximum number of '@' characters in a path while avoiding '*' characters. It uses dynamic programming to achieve this.
  - The function does not handle periodicity or simulate the occurrence of signs over time.
  
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function reads input data and applies `func_1` to each test case.
  - Since `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, applying it here does not solve the required problem.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the behavior of `func_1` in detail, confirming that it is designed for a path-finding problem with '@' and '*' characters.
- There is no mention of handling periodicity or simulating the occurrence of signs over time.

#### Correct Solution:
- The correct approach involves iterating through each sign's periodicity and calculating the next occurrence year sequentially.
- This is demonstrated in the corrected version provided in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct because the provided code does not address the problem requirements. The code is designed for a different problem involving paths with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to calculating the year of the n-th sign's occurrence based on periodicity.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
