The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables (`path`, `n`, `data`, `t`, `index`). Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `results`.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers; `n` is an integer; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
