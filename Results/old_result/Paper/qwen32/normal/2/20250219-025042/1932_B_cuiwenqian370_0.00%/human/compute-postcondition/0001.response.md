The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. This means that `data` will now hold the individual elements of the input string as separate string entries in a list.

Given the initial state where `path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers and `n` is an integer, after executing the code snippet, `path` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged. However, `data` is now a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers; `n` is an integer; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string.**
