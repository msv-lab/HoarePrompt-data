Reasoning:  
The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicity of each sign. However, the given functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) seem to be solving a different problem related to scoring a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the problem of determining the year of the apocalypse.

The correct approach to solve the problem would involve iterating through each test case, and for each test case, iteratively finding the next occurrence of each sign starting from the year after the previous sign's occurrence. This can be done by maintaining a variable to track the current year and updating it based on the periodicity of each sign.

Since the provided code does not address the problem correctly, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
