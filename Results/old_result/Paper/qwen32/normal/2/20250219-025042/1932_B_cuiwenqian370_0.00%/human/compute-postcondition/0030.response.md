To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given information.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is set to the first element in `data`.
   - `path` is the string value of the element at position `2 * t + 1` in `data`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the element at position `2 * t` in `data`.
   - `index` is set to `2 * t + 1`.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the result of applying `func_1` to the respective `path`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `results`.
   - For each iteration, it prints the current `result`.

3. **Observations from Given Output States**:
   - After the first iteration, `result` is the element at position `t` in `results`.
   - After the second iteration, `result` is the element at position `t + 1` in `results`.
   - After the third iteration, `result` is the element at position `t + 2` in `results`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `results` has `t` elements, the loop will iterate exactly `t` times.
   - By the end of the loop, all elements in `results` will have been printed.

### Final Output State:

- `data` remains unchanged.
- `t`, `path`, `n`, and `index` retain their initial values.
- `results` remains unchanged.
- All elements in `results` have been printed.

Output State: **All elements in `results` have been printed. `data`, `t`, `path`, `n`, and `index` remain unchanged.**
