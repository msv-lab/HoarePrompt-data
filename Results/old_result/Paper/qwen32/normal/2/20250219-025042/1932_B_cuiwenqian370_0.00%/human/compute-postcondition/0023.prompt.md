Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers; `n` is an integer; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    path = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(path))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path` is the string value of the third element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(path)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path` is the string value of the fifth element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 5; `results` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(path)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path` is the string value of the seventh element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the sixth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 7; `results` contains three elements, all of which are the result of `func_1(path)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
