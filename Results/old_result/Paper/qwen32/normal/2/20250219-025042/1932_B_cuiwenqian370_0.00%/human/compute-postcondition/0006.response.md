The code assigns the value of the second element in the `data` list (since `index` is 1) to `n` after converting it to an integer. 

Given the initial state, `n` was originally an integer, and now it is specifically the integer value of the second element in the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers, `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**.
