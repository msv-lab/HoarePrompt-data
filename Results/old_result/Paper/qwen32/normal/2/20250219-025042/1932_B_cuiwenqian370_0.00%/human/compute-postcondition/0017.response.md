The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` in the `range(t)`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable used just for iteration, we don't need to adjust its state explicitly. Instead, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented correctly so that the loop can execute one more time.

Given that `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the current iteration.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was greater than 0.
- Since the loop decrements `t` implicitly by iterating, we need to ensure that `t` is still greater than 0 for the next iteration.

Therefore, we need to decrement `t` by 1 to reflect the current iteration.

State: **`path` is the string value of the fifth element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 5; `results` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(path)`**
