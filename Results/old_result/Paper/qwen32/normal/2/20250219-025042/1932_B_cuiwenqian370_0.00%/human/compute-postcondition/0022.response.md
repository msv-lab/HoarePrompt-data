The code appends the result of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. Since `results` initially contains two elements, after appending, it will contain three elements, all of which are the result of `func_1(path)`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`path` is the string value of the seventh element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the sixth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 7; `results` contains three elements, all of which are the result of `func_1(path)`**.
