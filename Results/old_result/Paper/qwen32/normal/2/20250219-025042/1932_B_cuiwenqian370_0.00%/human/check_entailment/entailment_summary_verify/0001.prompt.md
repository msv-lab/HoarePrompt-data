You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if path[0] == '@':
        dp[0] = 1
    elif path[0] == '*':
        dp[0] = -float('inf')
    if n > 1:
        if path[1] == '*':
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
    return max((x for x in dp if x > -float('inf')))

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        path = data[index]
        index += 1
        results.append(func_1(path))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path`. The string `path` contains space-separated integers representing the periodicity of signs. For each test case, the function computes a result using another function `func_1` and prints this result.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided code does not solve the problem described. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires us to determine the year in which the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1(path)`: This function seems to be designed to process a string `path` containing characters '@' and '*', and calculates some kind of score based on these characters. It does not relate to the problem of finding the year of the nth sign.
   - `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, it passes a string `path` to `func_1()`, which is not what the problem requires. The problem requires processing a list of integers representing the periodicity of each sign.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - For each test case, we need to iterate through the list of periodicities and calculate the year when each subsequent sign can occur. This involves keeping track of the current year and finding the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one has occurred.
   - For example, if the first sign occurs every 3 years, the second sign every 2 years, and so on, we start from year 0, find the first occurrence of the first sign (year 3), then find the first occurrence of the second sign after year 3 (year 4), and so forth.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Here is a correct implementation of the solution:
     ```python
     def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
         current_year = 0
         for period in periods:
             # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
             current_year = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
         return current_year
     
     def main():
         import sys
         input = sys.stdin.read
         data = input().split()
         t = int(data[0])
         index = 1
         results = []
         for _ in range(t):
             n = int(data[index])
             index += 1
             periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
             index += n
             results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
         for result in results:
             print(result)
     
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()
     ```

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is:
