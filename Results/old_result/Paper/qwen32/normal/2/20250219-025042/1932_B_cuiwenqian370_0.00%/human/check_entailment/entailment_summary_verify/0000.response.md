### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. Specifically, once the i-th sign occurs in year \( x \), the (i+1)-th sign must occur in a year \( y \) such that \( y > x \) and \( y \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ a_{i+1}) \).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function appears to be designed to process a string `path` containing '@' and '*' characters. It calculates some value based on the presence of '@' characters and ignores '*' characters by setting their corresponding values to negative infinity.
   - There is no mention of periodicity or sequential occurrence of events as required by the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
   - Given that `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, applying it here does not solve the required problem.

#### Function Summaries:
- The function summary for `func_2` incorrectly describes the input format and the role of `func_1`. It suggests that `path` is a string containing space-separated integers, which is not consistent with the problem description. Additionally, it mentions that `func_1` computes a result based on this path, which is unrelated to the problem.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not address the problem requirements. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are irrelevant to the task of calculating the year of the n-th sign's occurrence based on periodicity.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
