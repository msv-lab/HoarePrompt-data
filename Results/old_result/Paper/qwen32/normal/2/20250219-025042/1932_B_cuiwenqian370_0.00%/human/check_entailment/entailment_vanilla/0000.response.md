### Reasoning:

The provided code does not solve the problem described. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires us to determine the year in which the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1(path)`: This function seems to be designed to process a string `path` containing characters '@' and '*', and calculates some kind of score based on these characters. It does not relate to the problem of finding the year of the nth sign.
   - `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, it passes a string `path` to `func_1()`, which is not what the problem requires. The problem requires processing a list of integers representing the periodicity of each sign.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - For each test case, we need to iterate through the list of periodicities and calculate the year when each subsequent sign can occur. This involves keeping track of the current year and finding the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one has occurred.
   - For example, if the first sign occurs every 3 years, the second sign every 2 years, and so on, we start from year 0, find the first occurrence of the first sign (year 3), then find the first occurrence of the second sign after year 3 (year 4), and so forth.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Here is a correct implementation of the solution:
     ```python
     def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
         current_year = 0
         for period in periods:
             # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
             current_year = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
         return current_year
     
     def main():
         import sys
         input = sys.stdin.read
         data = input().split()
         t = int(data[0])
         index = 1
         results = []
         for _ in range(t):
             n = int(data[index])
             index += 1
             periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
             index += n
             results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
         for result in results:
             print(result)
     
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()
     ```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
