The code snippet assigns the value of the fourth element in the `data` list (since `index` is 3) to the variable `n`. This means `n` will now hold the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.

Given the initial state, `n` was originally the integer value of the second element in `data`. After executing the code, `n` is updated to the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.

Output State: **`path` is the string value of the third element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(path)`**.
