To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

The loop increments `b[ma]` until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`. The variable `ma` is the index of the median in the sorted list `b`. If `num2` (which is the length of the list `a`) is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. Otherwise, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`.

Given the initial conditions and the outputs after the first three iterations, we can infer that `b[ma]` was incremented three times, and each time, `new_median` was not greater than `median` until the fourth increment made `new_median` greater than `median`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Initially, `b[ma]` is incremented once, making `op = 1`.
2. After the second increment, `op = 2`.
3. After the third increment, `op = 3`.
4. After the fourth increment, `new_median` becomes greater than `median`, and the loop terminates.

Thus, `b[ma]` is incremented four times in total. This means `op` will be 4, and `b[ma]` will be `median + 4`.

### Final Output State:
- `t`: remains the same as the initial state.
- `n`: remains the same as the initial state.
- `a`: remains the same as the initial state.
- `num`: remains the same as the initial state.
- `num2`: remains the same as the initial state.
- `case`: remains the same as the initial state.
- `op`: is 4 because the loop ran 4 times.
- `i`: is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so it is incremented 4 times, but since the problem does not specify the initial value of `i`, we assume it is incremented by 1 for the loop, making `i` incremented by 1.
- `b`: is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 4.
- `median`: is the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment.
- `new_median`: is the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is `median + 4`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string case; num is greater than 0; num2 is an input integer; case is the input string; op is 4; i is incremented by 1; b is the sorted list of integers derived from a with b[ma] incremented by 4; median is b[ma] before the last increment; new_median is b[ma] after the last increment, which is median + 4.**

In simple terms, the loop runs until the median of the list `b` increases by 4, and the number of operations (`op`) performed is 4.
