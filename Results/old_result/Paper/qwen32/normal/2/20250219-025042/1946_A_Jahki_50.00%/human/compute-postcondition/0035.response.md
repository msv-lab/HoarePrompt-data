To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the context around the variable `op`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `n`: An integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive.
- `a`: A list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`.
- `num`: An integer greater than 0.
- `num2`: An integer less than or equal to 10,000.
- `case`: The input string.
- `op`: The total number of iterations the loop ran.
- `b`: A fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median > median`.
- `median`: The value of `b[ma]` before the last increment.
- `new_median`: The value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`.

### Key Focus:
The variable `op` represents the total number of iterations a loop has run. Since the exact loop and its conditions are not provided in the initial state, we can only infer that `op` holds the count of how many times the loop iterated.

### Conclusion:
The `print(op)` statement will output the value of `op`, which is the number of iterations the loop ran.

### Final Output:
Output: **op (where op is the total number of iterations the loop ran)**
