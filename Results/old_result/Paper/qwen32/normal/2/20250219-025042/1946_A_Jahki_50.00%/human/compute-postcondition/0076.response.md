The code snippet provided updates the list `a` by converting the elements of the input string `case` into integers, but only if those elements are digits. This means that `a` will now contain integers parsed from `case`.

Given the initial state, `a` was a list of `n` integers, but after executing the code, `a` will be reassigned to a new list of integers derived from the input string `case`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 0**.

In simpler terms, the list `a` is now a new list of integers extracted from the input string `case`. All other variables retain their original values.
