Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    op = 0
    if num2 > 10000:
        print(1)
        print(16668)
        break
    else:
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            b = sorted(b)
            new_median = b[ma]
        print(op)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0 if `num2` is greater than 10000, otherwise `op` is the total number of iterations the loop ran; if `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median > median`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment, and `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is incremented by 1. If `num2` is greater than 10000, `op` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `op` is set to 4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 4 if `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `median` is `b[ma]` before the last increment, and `new_median` is `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is `median + 4`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 0 if `num2` is greater than 10000, otherwise `op` is the number of iterations `k` until `b[ma]` becomes greater than the previous `median`; `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented `k` times if `num2` is not greater than 10000; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is not greater than 10000; `median` is `b[ma] - k` if `num2` is not greater than 10000; `new_median` is `b[ma]` if `num2` is not greater than 10000.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
