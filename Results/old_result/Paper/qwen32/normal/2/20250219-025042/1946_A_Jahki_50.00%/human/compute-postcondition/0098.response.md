To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop increments the middle element (`b[ma]`) of the sorted list `b` until the new median becomes greater than the old median.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- Initially, `median` is set to `b[ma]`.
- After each iteration, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, and the list `b` is re-sorted.
- The loop continues as long as `new_median` (which is `b[ma]` after incrementing and sorting) is less than or equal to `median`.

The loop will terminate when `b[ma]` is incremented enough such that it becomes greater than the previous `median`. At this point, `new_median` will be greater than `median`, and the loop will stop.

Let's denote the number of iterations required for the loop to terminate as `k`. After `k` iterations, `b[ma]` will have been incremented `k` times, and `new_median` will be `b[ma]`, which will be greater than `median`.

Given the pattern from the first 3 iterations, we can generalize that after `k` iterations:
- `op` will be `k`.
- `b[ma]` will be incremented by `k`.
- `median` will be `b[ma] - k` before the last increment.
- `new_median` will be `b[ma]` after the last increment, and it will be greater than `median`.

Since the loop stops when `new_median > median`, the final state will be:
- `op` will be the number of iterations `k` until `b[ma]` becomes greater than the previous `median`.
- `b` will be the sorted list with `b[ma]` incremented `k` times.
- `median` will be the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment.
- `new_median` will be the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`.

Without specific values for `a`, `num2`, and `case`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `op`, `b`, `median`, and `new_median`. However, we can describe the final state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is the number of iterations `k` until `b[ma]` becomes greater than the previous `median`; `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented `k` times; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`; `median` is `b[ma] - k`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep incrementing the middle element of the sorted list until it becomes greater than its previous value, and the final state will reflect this incrementation.
