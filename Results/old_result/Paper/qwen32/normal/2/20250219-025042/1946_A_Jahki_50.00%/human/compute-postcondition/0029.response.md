To determine how to adjust the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `new_median <= median` must hold true. Currently, `new_median` is `b[ma]` and `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, so the condition is satisfied.

Since the condition is already satisfied, no adjustment is needed to ensure the loop executes one more time. We simply repeat the program state as it is at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 2; `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 and placed in the correct sorted position; `median` is `b[ma] + 1`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`**
