The code snippet `b[ma] += 1` increments the value at index `ma` in the list `b` by 1. This affects the value of `b[ma]`, which was previously `median`. After the increment, `b[ma]` becomes `new_median`, which is greater than `median`.

Given the initial state, `b[ma]` was `median` and after the increment, `b[ma]` becomes `new_median`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1; `median` is `b[ma]` before the increment; `new_median` is `b[ma]` after the increment and must be greater than `median`**.
