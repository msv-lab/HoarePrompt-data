The given code snippet sorts the list `b`. Since `b` was already sorted before the operation (as per the initial state description), sorting it again does not change its order. Therefore, the values of `b`, `ma`, `median`, `new_median`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `i`, and `op` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 3; `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 3; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`; `median` is `b[ma] - 1`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`**
