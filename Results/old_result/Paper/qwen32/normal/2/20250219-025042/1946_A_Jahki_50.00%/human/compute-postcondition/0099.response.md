To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the relevant variables step-by-step:

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n`: An integer between 1 and 10^5.
   - `a`: A list of integers parsed from the input string `case`.
   - `num`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `num2`: An input integer.
   - `case`: The input string.
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 (though this doesn't affect the value of `op` directly).
   - `op`: Number of iterations `k` until `b[ma]` becomes greater than the previous `median`.
   - `b`: Sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented `k` times.
   - `ma`: Index in `b` calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `int(num2 / 2)`.
   - `median`: Initial median value, calculated as `b[ma] - k`.
   - `new_median`: New median value after incrementing `b[ma]`, which is `b[ma]`.

2. **Understanding `op`:**
   - `op` is the number of times `b[ma]` needs to be incremented until it becomes greater than its previous median value.
   - Initially, `median = b[ma] - k` and `new_median = b[ma]`.
   - Since `op` counts the number of increments required for `b[ma]` to exceed `median`, and `median` is initially set to `b[ma] - k`, the number of increments `k` needed to make `b[ma] > median` is simply `k`.

Given the definitions and the fact that `op` is defined as the number of iterations `k` until `b[ma]` becomes greater than the previous `median`, we can conclude that `op` is essentially the value of `k`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(op)` statement will be the value of `k`, which is the number of increments required to make `b[ma]` greater than its initial median value.

Output: **op (where op is the number of iterations k until b[ma] becomes greater than the previous median)**
