Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new string provided by user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new string `s`. If '11' is in `s`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.**
