Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description asks for a Python script that scans through directories within the current working directory, checks if their names are within a specified numeric range, and then generates specific files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in those directories. 

However, the given program defines a function `func_1()` that reads an integer `t`, then for each of the next `t` lines, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of '1' in the string `s` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions related to the count of '1's and the presence of '11' in the string. This logic has nothing to do with the problem described.
