The code snippet `cnt1 = s.count('1')` updates the value of `cnt1` to be the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new string provided by user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new string `s`.**
