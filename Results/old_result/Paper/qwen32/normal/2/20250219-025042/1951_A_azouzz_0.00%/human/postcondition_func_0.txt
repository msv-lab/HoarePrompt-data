The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s`. It then checks the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions related to the count of '1's and the presence of '11' in the string.
