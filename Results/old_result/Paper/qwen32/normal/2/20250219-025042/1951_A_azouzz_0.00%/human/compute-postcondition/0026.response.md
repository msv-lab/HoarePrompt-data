Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new string provided by user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new string `s`. Whether '11' is in `s` or not, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.**
