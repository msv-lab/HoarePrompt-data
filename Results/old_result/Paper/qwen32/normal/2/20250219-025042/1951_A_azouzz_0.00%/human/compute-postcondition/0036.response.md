The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables.
2. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
