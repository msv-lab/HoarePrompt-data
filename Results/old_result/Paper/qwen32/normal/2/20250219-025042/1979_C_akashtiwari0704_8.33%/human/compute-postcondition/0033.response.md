To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `ans` and how many times it runs. The loop runs `bets` times, and in each iteration, it appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to `ans`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

1. The loop runs `bets` times.
2. After each iteration `i`, `ans` contains the string representations of `a[0]` through `a[i]`, each followed by a space.

Therefore, after all `bets` iterations, `ans` will contain the string representations of `a[0]` through `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space.

The other variables (`t`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`) remain unchanged throughout the loop as per the problem statement.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **ans is a string containing the string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space.**

In simpler terms, the final value of `ans` will be a single string with all elements of the list `a` concatenated together, separated by spaces.
