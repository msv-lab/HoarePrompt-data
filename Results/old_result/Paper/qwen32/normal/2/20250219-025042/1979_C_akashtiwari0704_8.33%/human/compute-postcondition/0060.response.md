Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is the number of bets, `a` is the list of integers where each `a[i]` is `prod_initial^(bets-1) // a_initial[i]`, `prod` is the product of all elements in the updated `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated `a`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space if `sumo` < `prod` at any point, `T` is the number of times `sumo` was less than `prod`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
