Postcondition: **`prod` remains the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`; `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` in `[0, bets-1]` and `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`; `ans` is the initial string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` with spaces added based on the condition `sumo < prod`; `T` is incremented by `bets`; each `a[i]` for `i` in `[0, bets-1]` is `prod // a[i]`.**
