The given code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. This means that `ans` will now contain the previously stored string concatenated with the new value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `bets` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` before the modification
- `prod` is `prod^(bets-1)`
- `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1` and `sumo` is less than `prod`
- `ans` is an empty string

After executing the line `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '`, the variable `ans` will no longer be an empty string but will contain the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` before the modification, `prod` is `prod^(bets-1)`, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1` and `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**
