Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` before the modification, `prod` is `prod^(bets-1)`, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program does not change `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is the number of bets, `a` is the list of integers where each `a[i]` is `prod_initial^(bets-1) // a_initial[i]`, `prod` is the product of all elements in the updated `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated `a`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space if `sumo` < `prod` at any point, `T` is the number of times `sumo` was less than `prod`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function continues without additional changes. If `sumo` is less than `prod` at any point, `T` equals `bets` and `i` equals `bets`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `prod` remains the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`; `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` in `[0, bets-1]`; `ans` is the initial string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` with spaces added based on the condition `sumo < prod`; `T` is incremented by `bets`; each `a[i]` for `i` in `[0, bets-1]` is `prod // a[i]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, `ans` becomes the concatenated string of the string representations of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` with spaces added between them.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
