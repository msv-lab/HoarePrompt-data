The given code snippet multiplies the current value of `prod` by the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Initially, `prod` is set to `a[1] * a[1]` and `i` is 2.

After executing `prod *= a[i]`, the new value of `prod` will be the product of its old value (`a[1] * a[1]`) and `a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 2, `prod` is `a[1] * a[1] * a[2]`**.
