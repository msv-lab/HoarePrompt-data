Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the situation:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `bets` is the number of iterations.
- `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is initially `prod // a[i]` before any modification.
- `prod` is `prod^{(bets-1)}`.
- `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The provided code snippet is simply:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`). It directly prints `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
