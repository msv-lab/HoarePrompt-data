The function reads two integers `x` and `y` as strings, modifies them according to specific rules, and prints the modified versions of both integers. The modification involves swapping digits in `x` and `y` starting from the first position where `x` has a smaller digit than `y`, and continues swapping any subsequent positions where `x` has a larger digit than `y`. After processing, it prints the modified `x` followed by the modified `y`, each on a new line.
