You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, x and y have the same number of digits.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: After the loop finishes, `a` and `b` will be modified such that the first position where `a[i] < b[i]` results in a swap, and any subsequent positions where `a[i] > b[i]` also result in swaps. All other positions remain unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: All elements of list `a` are printed sequentially without any modifications to `a` or `b`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: All elements of list `a` are printed sequentially without any modifications to `a` or `b`, followed by all elements of list `b` printed sequentially without any modifications to `a` or `b`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no direct parameters but presumably processes `t` test cases where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers with the same number of digits, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
