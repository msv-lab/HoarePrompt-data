To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[i], end='')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- There is a list `a`, but it is mentioned that it is not modified and its elements are printed sequentially. This detail about `a` does not directly affect the execution of the `print(b[i], end='')` statement.
- There is another list `b`, which must have at least one element.
- The variable `i` is used as an index to access an element in the list `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function is used to output the element at index `i` of the list `b`.
- The `end=''` argument ensures that no newline character is added after the printed element, so the next print statement (if any) would continue on the same line.
- Since the exact contents of `b` and the value of `i` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Description:
- The output will be the element at index `i` of the list `b`, printed without a trailing newline.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[i] (where b is the list and i is the index)**
