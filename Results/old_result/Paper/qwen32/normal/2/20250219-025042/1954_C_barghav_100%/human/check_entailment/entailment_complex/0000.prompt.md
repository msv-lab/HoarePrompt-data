Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, x and y have the same number of digits.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: After the loop finishes, `a` and `b` will be modified such that the first position where `a[i] < b[i]` results in a swap, and any subsequent positions where `a[i] > b[i]` also result in swaps. All other positions remain unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: All elements of list `a` are printed sequentially without any modifications to `a` or `b`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: All elements of list `a` are printed sequentially without any modifications to `a` or `b`, followed by all elements of list `b` printed sequentially without any modifications to `a` or `b`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `x` and `y` as strings, modifies them according to specific rules, and prints the modified versions of both integers. The modification involves swapping digits in `x` and `y` starting from the first position where `x` has a smaller digit than `y`, and continues swapping any subsequent positions where `x` has a larger digit than `y`. After processing, it prints the modified `x` followed by the modified `y`, each on a new line.
