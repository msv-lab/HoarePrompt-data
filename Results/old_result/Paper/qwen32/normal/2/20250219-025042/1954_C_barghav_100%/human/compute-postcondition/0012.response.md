Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of the input number `x`; `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of the newly input number `y`. If `a[i]` was originally less than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is now the digit that was originally `b[i]`, `b[i]` is now the digit that was originally `a[i]`, and `f` is 1. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `f` remains 0.**
