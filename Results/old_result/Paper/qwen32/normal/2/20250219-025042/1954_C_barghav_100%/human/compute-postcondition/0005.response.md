Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of the input number `x` and must have at least one element; `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of the newly input number `y`; `f` is 0. The current value of `f` is 0. At the current index `i`, the digit represented by `a[i]` is less than the digit represented by `b[i]`.**
