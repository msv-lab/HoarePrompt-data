Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of the input number; `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of the newly input number; `f` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `f` is initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as no other operations affect them.
