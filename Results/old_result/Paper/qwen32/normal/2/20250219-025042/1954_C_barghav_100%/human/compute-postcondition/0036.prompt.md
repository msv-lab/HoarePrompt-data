Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of the input number; `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of the newly input number; `f` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if f == 0:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
            f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            f = 1
    elif a[i] > b[i]:
        a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of the input number `x` and `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of the newly input number `y`. If `f` was originally 0 and `a[i]` was less than `b[i]` for any index `i`, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `f` is not 0, for each index `i`, if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped. In all other cases, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of `x` and `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of `y`. If `a[i] < b[i]`, the digits at index `i` in `a` and `b` are swapped, and `f` is set to 1. If `a[i] > b[i]`, the digits at index `i` in `a` and `b` are swapped, and `f` is set to 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, no swap occurs. In all cases, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of `x` and `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of `y`. If `f` was initially 0 and `a[i] < b[i]`, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped, and `f` is set to 1. If `f` was initially 0 and `a[i] > b[i]`, then `f` is set to 1. If `f` was not 0 and `a[i] > b[i]`, then the i-th elements of `a` and `b` are swapped. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
