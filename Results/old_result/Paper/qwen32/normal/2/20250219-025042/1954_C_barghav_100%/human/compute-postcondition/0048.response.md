To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[i], end='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **List `a`**: It is mentioned that all elements of list `a` are printed sequentially without any modifications to `a` or `b`. This implies that `a` is not directly involved in the current `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print operation.
2. **List `b`**: It is stated that `b` must have at least one element. This means `b` is a non-empty list.
3. **Variable `i`**: It is mentioned that `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. This suggests that `i` is used as an index to access elements of list `b` in a loop.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
- The statement `print(b[i], end='')` will print the element at index `i` of list `b`.
- The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline character is added after printing the element, meaning subsequent prints will continue on the same line.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the print statement will output the elements of `b` one by one in sequence.
- The exact element printed depends on the current value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the output of the `print(b[i], end='')` statement will be the element of list `b` at the index `i`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `b[i]`.

Output: **b[i] (where b[i] is the element at index i of list b)**
