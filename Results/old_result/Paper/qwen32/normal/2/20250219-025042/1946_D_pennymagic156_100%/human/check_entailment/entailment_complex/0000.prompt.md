Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

# Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_5())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. This function reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers derived from the input line, where each integer is separated by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, splits the line into components based on whitespace, converts each component into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function does not have any parameters and thus no preconditions related to input variables can be described.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prompts the user for input, converts the input to an integer, and returns this integer value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_3`. This function is expected to read input from standard input and return a map object containing integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers that were obtained by converting each element of the input string, which is split by spaces, into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4()`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the provided function signature alone.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the user's input as a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` prompts the user for input, reads the input as a string, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the string, and then returns the processed string.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, and x is a non-negative integer representing the favorite number. a is a list of non-negative integers of length n.

    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue

                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:

            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either an empty list or a list containing accumulated `ai` values, `t` is an empty list, and `ans` is the maximum count of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution, or -1 if no such condition was met.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between 'ans' and the length of list 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum value between the number of times a specific bitwise operation results in zero during its execution and the length of a transformed list `a`. It processes an array `a` of non-negative integers and a non-negative integer `x` to determine this maximum value.
