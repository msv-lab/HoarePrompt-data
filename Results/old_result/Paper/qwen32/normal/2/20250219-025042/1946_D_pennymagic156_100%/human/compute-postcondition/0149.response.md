Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a non-empty list containing accumulated `ai` values, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the `i-th` bit of `val` and `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` since the last time `op` was 0.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that `cnt` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
