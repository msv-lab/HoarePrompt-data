Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least one element, `t` is either an empty list or a list containing `ai`, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is the i-th bit of `val`. If `op` is 0, then `t` contains `ai` and `ai` is 0.**
