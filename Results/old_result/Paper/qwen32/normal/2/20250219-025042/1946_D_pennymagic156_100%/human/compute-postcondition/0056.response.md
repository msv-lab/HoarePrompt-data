Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, and `u` is not equal to 0, and `v` is even and `v` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
