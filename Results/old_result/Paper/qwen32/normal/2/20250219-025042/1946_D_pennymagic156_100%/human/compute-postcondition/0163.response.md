Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `op` is the XOR of the `i-th` bits of all elements in `a`, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the iterations, `ai` retains its previous value. If `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. If `v` is even and zero, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
