The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop structure provided in the context, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, none of the variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `ai`) are modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is the XOR of the 27-th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0.**
