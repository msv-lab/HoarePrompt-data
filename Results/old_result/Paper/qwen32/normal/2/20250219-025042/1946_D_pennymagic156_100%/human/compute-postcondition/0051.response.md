Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `cnt` is 3 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is 2, `val` is the next element in `a`.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 2 if `op` is 0, or 1 otherwise, after the increment, `cnt` becomes 3 if `op` is 0, or 2 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
