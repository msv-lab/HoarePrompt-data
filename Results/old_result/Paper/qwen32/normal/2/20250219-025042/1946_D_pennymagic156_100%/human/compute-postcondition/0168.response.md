Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `x`, a non-negative integer representing the favorite number. The function also accepts an array `a` of non-negative integers of length `n`. The function returns -1 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns `ans`, which is not defined in the provided context. In Case_3, it returns the maximum value of `cnt`, which is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution. In Case_4, it returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`.**
