Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements, `t` is either an empty list or a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`), `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is 1. Since `op` is 1, the `if not op` condition is false, so none of the changes described in the if part are applied.**
