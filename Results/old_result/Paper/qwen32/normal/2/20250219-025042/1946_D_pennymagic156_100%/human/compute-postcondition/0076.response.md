Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `val` is `a[j+1]`, `ai` is `a[j+1] ^ val`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `t` is a list containing elements `[a[j+1], ai]` if `op` was `0` before the operation, otherwise `t` is a list containing only `[ai]`.**

Explanation: The list `t` had one element `a[j+1]` if `op` was `0` before the operation, otherwise it was an empty list. After executing `t.append(ai)`, `t` now contains `ai` as an additional element. If `op` was `0` before the operation, `t` now contains two elements `[a[j+1], ai]`; otherwise, `t` contains only `[ai]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
