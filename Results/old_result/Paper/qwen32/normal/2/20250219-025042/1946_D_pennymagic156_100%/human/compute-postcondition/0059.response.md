Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. If `u` equals 0, then `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is the XOR of the i-th bits of all elements in `a`, and `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0. If `u` does not equal 0, then if `v` is odd, the state remains unchanged from the precondition. If `v` is even, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)` where `cnt` is the number of times `op` was zero during the iterations, unless `v` is zero, in which case `ans` remains -1.**
