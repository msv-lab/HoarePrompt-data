The code snippet sets `op` and `ai` to 0. This means that the values of `op` and `ai` are explicitly changed, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.**
