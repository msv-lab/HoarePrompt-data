The code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `(val >> i) & 1` and is 0, `cnt` is 1**.
