The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no change to any variables in the given code snippet, the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is such that `v % 2` is not equal to 0**.
