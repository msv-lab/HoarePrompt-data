Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `u` is not equal to 0, and `v` is even and non-zero; `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `op` and `cnt`, both set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as no changes were made to them.
