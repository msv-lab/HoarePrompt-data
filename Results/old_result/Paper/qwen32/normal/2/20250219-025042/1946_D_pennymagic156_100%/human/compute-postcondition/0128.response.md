The code snippet provided is:

```python
ai ^= val
```

This line performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. 

Given the initial state, `ai` is 0 if a certain if condition is met, otherwise it retains its original value. The value of `val` is the next element in the list `a`.

After executing the line `ai ^= val`, the new value of `ai` will be the result of the XOR operation between its previous value and `val`.

Since the other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `cnt`, `ans`, `i`) are not modified by this line, they retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is a list containing the element `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains unchanged, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `ai` is the result of `ai ^ val`, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `val` is the next element in `a`**.
