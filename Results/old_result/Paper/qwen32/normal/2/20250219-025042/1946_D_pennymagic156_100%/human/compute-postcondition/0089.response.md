The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, none of the variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `ai`) will be altered by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])` and `v` is odd, `op` is the XOR of the 27-th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0. If `u == v == 0`, the state remains as described above.**
