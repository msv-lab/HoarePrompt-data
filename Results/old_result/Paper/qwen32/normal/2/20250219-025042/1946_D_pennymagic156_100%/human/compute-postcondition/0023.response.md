The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Given that `t` was either an empty list or a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`), after executing this line, `t` will definitely contain `ai` as its last element.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `x` remains a non-negative integer.
- `a` remains the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements.
- `t` now contains `ai` as its last element, so if `t` was previously empty, it will now be `[ai]`; if `t` already contained elements, `ai` will be appended to the end of the list.
- `ans` remains -1.
- `u` remains `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0.
- `v` remains an even number or 0.
- `op` remains 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements, `t` contains `ai` as its last element, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is 1.**
