To determine the output state, let's analyze the given conditions and the code snippet.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`.
- `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`.
- `op` is the XOR of the 27-th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0.
- If `u == 0`, `ai` is set to 0.
- If `u != 0` and `v` is odd, the state remains as described above.
- If `u != 0` and `v` is even and non-zero, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution, and `ans` is the maximum value between its previous value and `cnt`.
- If `u == v == 0`, the loop breaks or the if statement is exited, and `i` is set to 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return ans
```

From the description, `ans` is only updated when `u != 0` and `v` is even and non-zero, and it holds the maximum value of `cnt` (the number of times `op` became 0).

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `ai`, `cnt`, and `ans`, we can only infer the possible values of `ans` based on the conditions provided.

However, if we assume that the loop has executed and `ans` has been updated based on the conditions, the final value of `ans` would be the maximum value of `cnt`.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum value of `cnt`, which is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution.**
