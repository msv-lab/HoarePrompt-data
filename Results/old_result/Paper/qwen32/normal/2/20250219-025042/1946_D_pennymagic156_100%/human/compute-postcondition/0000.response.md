The code snippet `n, x = func_3()` assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n` and `x`. Since the function `func_3()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact values that `n` and `x` will take. However, we know that `n` will be a positive integer and `x` will be a non-negative integer after the assignment.

Given the initial state, the only variables that are affected are `n` and `x`. The variable `a` (the list of non-negative integers) remains unchanged because it is not mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`.**
