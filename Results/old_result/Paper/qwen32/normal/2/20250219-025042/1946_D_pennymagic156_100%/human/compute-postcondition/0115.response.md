The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables directly but changes the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement will skip the remaining part of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, none of the variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `ai`, `cnt`, `ans`, `i`) will be modified by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is the XOR of the 27-th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0. If `u == 0`, `ai` is set to 0. If `u != 0` and `v` is odd, the state remains as described above. If `u != 0` and `v` is even and non-zero, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution, and `ans` is the maximum value between its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` is 0**.
