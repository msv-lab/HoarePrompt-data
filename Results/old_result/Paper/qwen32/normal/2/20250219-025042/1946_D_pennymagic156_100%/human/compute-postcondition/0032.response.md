To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables evolve with each iteration. Let's break down the loop step-by-step based on the provided information:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: Positive integer (unchanged).
   - `x`: Non-negative integer (unchanged).
   - `a`: Return value of `func_1()` (unchanged).
   - `t`: Empty list initially.
   - `ans`: -1 (unchanged).
   - `u`: `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0 (unchanged).
   - `v`: Even number or 0 (unchanged).
   - `op`: 0 initially.
   - `ai`: 0 initially.

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - For each `val` in `a`:
     - `op ^= val >> i & 1`: This updates `op` by XORing it with the i-th bit of `val`.
     - `ai ^= val`: This updates `ai` by XORing it with `val`.
     - `if not op`: If `op` becomes 0, `ai` is appended to `t`, and `ai` is reset to 0.

3. **Final State Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over all elements in `a`.
   - `op` will keep toggling based on the i-th bit of each `val`.
   - `ai` accumulates the XOR of all `val` until `op` becomes 0, at which point `ai` is added to `t` and reset.
   - After all iterations, `op` will reflect the XOR of the i-th bits of all elements in `a`.
   - `ai` will be the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never becomes 0 during the loop; otherwise, it will be the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0.

Given these points, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `n`, `x`, `a`, `ans`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
- `t` will contain the accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0 during the loop.
- `op` will be the XOR of the i-th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `ai` will be the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it will be the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is the XOR of the i-th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0.**
