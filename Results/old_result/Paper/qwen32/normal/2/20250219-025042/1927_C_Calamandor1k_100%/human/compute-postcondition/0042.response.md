The only variables in the loop head are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4;
- `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n', m', k', a', b');
- `a` is a list of n' integers where 1 <= a'_i <= 10^6 for each i;
- `b` is a list of m' integers where 1 <= b'_j <= 10^6 for each j;
- `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`;
- `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`;
- `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`;
- `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`;
- `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`;
- `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`;
- `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`;
- `total_distinct` is `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`;
- `results` contains `'YES'` appended to its previous contents.

We need to consider the next tuple in the `cases` list for the next iteration of the loop. Let's denote the next tuple as `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`.

Here is the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next); `a` is a list of n_next integers where 1 <= a_next_i <= 10^6 for each i; `b` is a list of m_next integers where 1 <= b_next_j <= 10^6 for each j; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k_next`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k_next`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `total_distinct` is `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`; `results` contains `'YES'` appended to its previous contents.**

Note: The sets `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` will be recalculated based on the new values of `a` and `b` from the next tuple `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`.
