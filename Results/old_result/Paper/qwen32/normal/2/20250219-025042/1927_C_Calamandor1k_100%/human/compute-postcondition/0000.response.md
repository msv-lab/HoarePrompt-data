The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified, and no computations are performed. The initial conditions regarding the integers `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), and k is even; each test case includes two lists: a list `a` of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i, and a list `b` of m integers where 1 <= b_j <= 10^6 for each j; `results` is an empty list.**
