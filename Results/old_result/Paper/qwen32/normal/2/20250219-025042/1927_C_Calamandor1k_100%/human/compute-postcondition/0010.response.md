Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), and k is even; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_j <= 10^6 for each j; `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. The current value of `only_a` has more than k // 2 elements.** 

In simpler terms, the only change is that the string `'NO'` has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
