The code snippet updates the `only_b` set by calculating the difference between `relevant_b` and `relevant_a`. This means `only_b` will now contain elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.

Given the initial state, the updated state will be:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `cases` remains a list containing at least one tuple (n', m', k', a', b').
- `a` remains a list of n' integers where 1 <= a'_i <= 10^6 for each i.
- `b` remains a list of m' integers where 1 <= b'_j <= 10^6 for each j.
- `unique_a` remains a set containing unique elements from the list `a`.
- `unique_b` remains a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.
- `relevant_a` remains a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `relevant_b` remains a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `only_a` remains a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
- `only_b` is updated to contain elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
- `both` remains a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
- `total_distinct` remains `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`, but since `only_b` has been recalculated, this value may change.
- `results` remains containing 'YES' appended to its previous contents.
