The code snippet `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial contents of `results`, it will now contain an additional element `'NO'`.

Given the initial state, `results` could initially contain either `['YES']` or `['YES', 'NO']`. After executing the code, `results` will definitely contain `'NO'` as its last element.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `cases` remains a list containing at least one tuple (n', m', k', a', b').
- `a` remains a list of n' integers where 1 <= a'_i <= 10^6 for each i.
- `b` remains a list of m' integers where 1 <= b'_j <= 10^6 for each j.
- `unique_a` remains a set containing unique elements from the list `a`.
- `unique_b` remains a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.
- `relevant_a` remains a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `relevant_b` remains a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `only_a` remains a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
- `only_b` remains a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
- `both` remains a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
- `total_distinct` remains `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`.
- `results` now contains `'NO'` appended to its previous contents.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n', m', k', a', b'); `a` is a list of n' integers where 1 <= a'_i <= 10^6 for each i; `b` is a list of m' integers where 1 <= b'_j <= 10^6 for each j; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `total_distinct` is `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`; `results` contains `'NO'` appended to its previous contents.**
