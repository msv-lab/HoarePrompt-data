Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next); `a` is a list of n_next integers where 1 <= a_next_i <= 10^6 for each i; `b` is a list of m_next integers where 1 <= b_next_j <= 10^6 for each j; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k_next`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k_next`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `total_distinct` is `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`; `results` contains `'YES'` if `len(only_a) > k // 2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged; `results` now includes `'NO'`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change any of the variables or their values. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
