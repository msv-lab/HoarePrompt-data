The code snippet resets the `cnt` list to a new list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. This means that all previous counts stored in `cnt` are lost and replaced with zeros.

Given the initial state:
- `input` holds a valid integer `t` where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is `t`
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each `cnt[x]` represents the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`

After executing the code snippet `cnt = [0] * (n + 1)`, the `cnt` list is now a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` zeros; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.**
