The initial state provides us with specific values for the variables involved in the code snippet:

- `ans` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is explicitly given as 4.
- `a` is a list `[1, 2, 2, 3]`.
- `cnt` is a list `[0, 1, 2, 1, 0]`.

The Python code snippet contains only one statement:
```python
print(ans)
```

Given that `ans` is explicitly defined as 1, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1**
