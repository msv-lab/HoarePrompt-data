Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in the hand. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions. Specifically, it handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the constraint that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
