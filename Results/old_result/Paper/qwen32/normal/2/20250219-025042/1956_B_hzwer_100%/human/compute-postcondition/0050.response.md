The given code snippet increments the count at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. This means the value at `cnt[x]` will increase by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is updated to reflect the new sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element.
- `cnt` has its value at index `x` incremented by 1.
- `x` is the next element in the list `a`.

After executing `cnt[x] += 1`, the value at `cnt[x]` will be increased by 1. However, the value of `ans` is already calculated based on the previous state of `cnt`. Since `ans` is not recalculated in the provided code snippet, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the only change is in `cnt` at index `x`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to reflect the new sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `cnt` has its value at index `x` incremented by 1; `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
