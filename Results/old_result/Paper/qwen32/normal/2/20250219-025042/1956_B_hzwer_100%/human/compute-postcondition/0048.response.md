The code snippet `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. This means the count associated with the current value of `x` (which is `x_next`, the next element in the list `a`) is increased by 1.

Since the only variable being modified here is `cnt` at index `x`, the other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `ans` continues to reflect the new sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, `n` remains the input integer, and `a` remains the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to reflect the new sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `cnt` has its value at index `x` incremented by 1; `x` is `x_next`, where `x_next` is the next element in the list `a`.**
