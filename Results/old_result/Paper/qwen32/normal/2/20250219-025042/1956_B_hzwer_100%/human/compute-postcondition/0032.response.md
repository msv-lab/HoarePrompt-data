The given code snippet sets `ans` to 0. This means the value of `ans` is explicitly overwritten, regardless of its previous value.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`; `ans` is 0.**
