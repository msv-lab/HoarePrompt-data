The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(num) - 2`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to decrement `i` by 1, as per the loop's behavior.

Given:
- `num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\).
- `tot` is 2.
- `i` is `len(num) - 2`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(num) - 3`.

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 3`**.
