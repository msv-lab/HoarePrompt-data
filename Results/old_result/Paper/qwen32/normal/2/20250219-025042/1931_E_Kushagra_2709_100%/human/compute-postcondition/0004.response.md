Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9, `tot` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in `num` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `num`, `tot`, and the condition regarding the character at index `i` in `num` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
