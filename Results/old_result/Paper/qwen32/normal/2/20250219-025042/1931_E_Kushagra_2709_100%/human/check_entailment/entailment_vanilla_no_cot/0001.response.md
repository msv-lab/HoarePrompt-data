Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Rules:**
   - Anna starts by reversing the digits of any number in the list.
   - Sasha then concatenates any two numbers in the list.
   - The game continues until only one number remains.
   - Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the winner if both players play optimally.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The length of the final number is crucial.
   - Anna's move can reduce the length of a number by removing leading zeros after reversing.
   - Sasha's move increases the total length of the numbers in the list by concatenating two numbers.
   - The game ends when there is only one number left, and the winner is determined by the length of this number.

### Code Analysis:

The provided code consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: This function determines the winner based on the total length of the numbers in the list after Anna's optimal moves.
- `zerocnts`: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.

#### Function `zerocnts`:
- This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.
- It converts the number to a string and iterates from the end to count the zeros.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Step 1:** Calculate the total length of all numbers in the list.
- **Step 2:** Calculate the number of trailing zeros for each number and sort them in descending order.
- **Step 3:** Subtract the trailing zeros from the total length for every second number in the sorted list (considering Anna's optimal moves).
- **Step 4:** Compare the resulting total length with \(m + 1\) to determine the winner.

### Correctness Evaluation:

The logic in `func_1` seems flawed because it assumes that Anna's optimal strategy is to remove trailing zeros from every second number. However, Anna's optimal strategy might involve more complex decisions, such as reversing numbers to minimize the final number's length or strategically choosing numbers to reverse.

Here's a counterexample where the current implementation fails:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
1
3 5
100 100 100

Expected Output:
Anna

Actual Output:
Sasha
```

In this case, Anna can reverse any number to remove trailing zeros, but Sasha can still concatenate numbers to form a number with a length of 5 or more. However, the optimal strategy involves more complex interactions between Anna and Sasha's moves.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
