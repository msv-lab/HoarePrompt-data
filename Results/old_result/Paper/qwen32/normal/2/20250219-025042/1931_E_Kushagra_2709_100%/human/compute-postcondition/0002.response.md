To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `len(num)`, and the range parameters.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate over the indices of the string `num` from the last index to the first index. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value, which means `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. This implies that `num` must have at least one character.

Since `num` is already described as a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), it is guaranteed to have at least one character. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `num`.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and its initial value will be set by the range function, so we don't need to specify an initial value for `i` before the loop starts.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute. We just need to ensure that `num` has at least one character, which is already given.

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9, `tot` is 0**
