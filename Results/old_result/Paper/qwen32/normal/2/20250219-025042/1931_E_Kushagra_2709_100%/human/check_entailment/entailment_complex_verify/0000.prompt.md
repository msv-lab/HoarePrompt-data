You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

#Function 2:
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is a non-negative integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: `tot` is the sum of the number of digits of all integers in `nums` minus the sum of `cntvals[i]` for all even indices `i` in `cntvals`.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the number of digits of all integers in `nums` minus the sum of `cntvals[i]` for all even indices `i` in `cntvals` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the winner of a game between Sasha and Anna based on the sum of the number of digits of integers in a list, adjusted by subtracting the count of zeros at even positions in a sorted list of zero counts. If the adjusted sum is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: `num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer 'num'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `zerocnts` takes an integer `num` as input, where `num` is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and returns the count of trailing zeros in its decimal representation.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

1. **Game Mechanics**: 
   - **Anna's Turn**: She reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing any leading zeros.
   - **Sasha's Turn**: He concatenates two different numbers in any order and inserts the result back into the list.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Sasha wins if the final number is not less than \(10^m\).

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1` calculates the total length of all numbers in the list after removing trailing zeros (which is not the correct operation for Anna's turn).
   - It then iteratively subtracts the counts of trailing zeros from the total length, considering pairs of numbers.
   - Finally, it checks if the remaining total length is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\) to determine the winner.

4. **Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Handling of Anna's Turn**: The code does not actually reverse the digits of the numbers, nor does it handle leading zeros correctly for Anna's turn.
   - **Incorrect Handling of Sasha's Turn**: The code does not simulate Sasha's concatenation operation. It only considers the length of numbers and trailing zeros, which does not reflect the actual game mechanics.
   - **Winning Condition Misinterpretation**: The code checks the total length of numbers after removing trailing zeros, which is not the same as checking the value of the final concatenated number.

5. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     2 2
     14 2
     ```
   - According to the problem, Anna can reverse either 14 to 41 or 2 to 2. If she reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). So, Sasha wins.
   - However, the code will not correctly simulate this scenario because it does not properly handle the digit reversal and concatenation operations.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the game rules and winning conditions as described in the problem statement. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
