### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic behind the given code and compare it with the problem statement.

1. **Objective**: The objective is to determine the winner of the game between Sasha and Anna based on the rules provided. Sasha wins if the final number after all moves is not less than \(10^m\). Otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing leading zeros.
   - Sasha concatenates two chosen numbers in any order and inserts the result back into the list, reducing the list size by one.
   - The game ends when there is only one number left in the list.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - The game's outcome depends on the total number of digits in the numbers in the list, adjusted by the number of trailing zeros in the numbers that Anna can potentially reverse.
   - By reversing numbers, Anna can reduce the total number of digits in the list by removing trailing zeros.
   - Sasha's goal is to ensure that the final number has enough digits to be at least \(10^m\).

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - `func_1` calculates the total number of digits in the list (`tot`).
   - It then calculates the number of trailing zeros in each number using `zerocnts` and sorts these counts in descending order.
   - By iterating over the sorted list of trailing zeros and subtracting the counts at even indices from `tot`, the function adjusts the total number of digits to account for Anna's optimal moves.
   - Finally, it checks if the adjusted total number of digits is at least \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided example cases are correctly handled by the implementation.
   - The logic aligns with the problem statement, ensuring that the function correctly determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

**Correctness: True**
