Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `num` was originally an integer within the range from 1 to 10^9. After the code execution, `num` is now a string that represents the same integer value. The precondition that `num` was within the specified range remains valid, but its type has changed from an integer to a string.
