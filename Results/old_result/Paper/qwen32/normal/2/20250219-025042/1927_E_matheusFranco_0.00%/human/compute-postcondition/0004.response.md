The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and `t` is decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after being decreased by 1.

This means that before the decrease, `t` must have been at least 2 (since 2 - 1 = 1, and 1 is still greater than 0).

State: **`t` must be at least 2**
