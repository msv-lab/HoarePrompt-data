To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` set to 2, and all other elements initialized to 0.
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `idx_v` is 1.
   - `curr_v` is 3.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of `permutation`, which is `n`.

3. **Adjustment Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k` in each iteration, we need to ensure that after the increment, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains less than `n`.

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k` in each iteration, we need to make sure that the current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` plus `k` is still less than `n`.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is such that `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < n`.

### Final Adjusted State
State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` set to 2, and all other elements initialized to 0; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be such that `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < n`**
