To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `permutation` list and the variables involved in its execution.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `0` elsewhere.
- `idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, and `i` are initialized as follows:
  - `idx` is 0
  - `idx_v` is 1
  - `curr_v` is `m+2`
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`
  - `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1

### Loop Execution Details:
- The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
- In each iteration:
  - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`.
  - `curr_v` is incremented by 1.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`.
