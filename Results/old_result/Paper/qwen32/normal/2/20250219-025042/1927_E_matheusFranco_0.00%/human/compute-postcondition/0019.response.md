To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand how the loop iterates and modifies the `permutation` list. The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list (`n`). In each iteration, it sets the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list to `curr_v`, then increments `curr_v` by 1 and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`.

Given that `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, the loop will fill every `k`-th position in the `permutation` list starting from index 0 until it can no longer do so without exceeding the bounds of the list.

Let's break down the final state:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0s.
   - `idx` is 0 (though `idx` is not used in the loop).
   - `idx_v` is 1 (though `idx_v` is not used in the loop).
   - `curr_v` is 1.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is set to `curr_v`.
   - `curr_v` is incremented by 1.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop terminates when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `n`.

Let's calculate the final state:

- The indices that will be modified are `0, k, 2k, 3k, ..., mk` where `mk < n` and `(m+1)k >= n`.
- The corresponding values set at these indices will be `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1`.

Thus, the final `permutation` list will have `1` at index `0`, `2` at index `k`, `3` at index `2k`, and so on, up to the largest multiple of `k` that is less than `n`.

**Final Output State**:
- `n` and `k` remain the same as in the initial state.
- `permutation` will have values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `0` elsewhere.
- `idx` remains 0.
- `idx_v` remains 1.
- `curr_v` will be `m+2` (one more than the last value assigned).
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that is a multiple of `k`.

In natural language, the final state means that the `permutation` list will have sequentially increasing numbers starting from 1 at every `k`-th position, and zeros everywhere else. The loop stops once it can no longer place a number at a valid index.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `0` elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that is a multiple of `k`.**
